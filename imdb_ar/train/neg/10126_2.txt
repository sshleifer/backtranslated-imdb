By granting budget and time constraints for sequential production, BATMAN and ROBIN acquire a place near the bottom of any "cliffhanger" list, and completely miss the style, imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor, 1943, BATMAN. <br /> <br /> The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as the "King of the Fast" and his director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more interested in the speed and efficiency of his interest in arousing excitement. (Unfortunately, this team has also produced two Superman series, Kirk Allen, with great animation, canned music, and tedious supporting actors.) The opening of each chapter provides a taste for the next: untold titles ("Robin" saves Batman, "Batman vs Wizard"), mechanical music being played, and two of our heroes stumbling toward the camera looking everywhere, either confused or having trouble seeing cheap Halloween masks. Batman's fir, with its horns and eagle's beak, fits so badly that the tumbler has to adjust it during scenes of fighting. Its "utility belt" is a strip of curly, no-compartment cloth that is still run to pull out the burner and the oxygen tube at critical moments! <br /> <br /> In any case, the main players are offending. Robert Laurie presents a small charm or individual taste like Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic character like Batman. He creates the impression that he prefers to be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, like Robin, has a great deal of difficulty in dealing with his limited dialogue. It is very old for the part, with a stunt man who fills it larger. Instead of fashion, Laurie and Duncan are just as thrilling as the weary businessmen heading for a drink, without the mileage in chemistry between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although the soap operas were not Well-known for personal development, BATMAN was able earlier to provide a more energetic crew. This group offers a group that goes through the motions, not that the filmmakers offer a lot of support. Do not stand out as one of the female leaders, led by one of the most wicked villains of all, the "magician". (The great name!) In fact, led by a person wearing a curtain, shawl and kisa on his head with a mingled voice tries to threaten. "Key suspects" - eccentric professor, radio announcer - simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Even a hard "regular" comic book is unnecessary. It is hard to distinguish much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the risks she faces, Vicky does not show any actual feelings. Commissioner Gordon is not very bright. Contrary to what happened in the previous series, Alfred The Butler is just the pathway and the most important thing is "Mr Wayne's Residence". They are the pillars of a long scheme, loaded with a stunt, incoherent, loaded with unflattering music, and the design of amateur products. The exterior of Wayne Manor is like a middle-class suburban house in a sitcom, and the interior of a cheap roadside hotel. Batcave is an office in urgent need of renovation. (Clothes are kept in a file cabinet!) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, filmmakers have not been able to do more to create an exciting adventure. Although the availability of the two series on DVD is an added advantage to any serious Batfan, it should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. They capture more of the original humor of the comic book compared to the combined Batman and Rubin classes. <br /> <br /> Now for good news - this is not the 1997 version!
