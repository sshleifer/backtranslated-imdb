I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but writing this movie did not work with me. The story jumps strangely (I have since learned that the film lacks a section), and that the characters appear and disappear suddenly. Some of the explanations are too vague (for example, "Why are you no longer a child!" - Go back to the picture for a long time and slowly - "You're a woman!" Yes, we got it the first time) Never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, involving the incestuous wishes (metaphorically if not technically) was so disturbing that it was hard to see. According to the author, this problem has been treated as a problem, and the May-December match is not portrayed as a good inevitability of some of Mary Beckford's films (for example, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chennai performs well as usual, but I think he was the best guide in the past - I've surpassed him several times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the clown series and was very impressed by the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, although he was an amazing young man. The film has its moments, but so far, it's a less favorable scene.
