Wonderful! I remember a lot of the terrible movies that have been around high school since the early 1980s. They usually had an incredibly tense plot, and many 27-year-old actors pretended to be students. When I saw this movie, I felt a little nostalgic for your early childhood in the 1980s. However, I then discovered that this film was made in 1989? say what! Well, the nostalgia is over there, and that's bad. This plot contains the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to move all students to the city's inner high schools. Which is strange, since the students in this school are wealthy and affluent. In fact, the main character lives in a palace. Makes you wonder how you can not find the money to keep this school alive, never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says they will stay in school if students can raise $ 200,000. So older people go to do it. Hmmm, you've collected $ 200,000 but instead of providing it for the college, you can put it about saving a high school that you're top in? And why exactly would they close a crowded school before the end of the year? And ... ah forgot it, this film was stupid and made in 1989 !?
