"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays the role of an investigator who tries to find a killer shooting arrows at people. Mira is an Italian accent that stumbled from time to time. Can not you speak only English? All other characters have a Mexican / English accent that is distracting. The dialogue is very bad and its connection is wooden. The cinema looks beautiful, but that's not enough to save this painting. This next part of this review does not contain vandals! <br /> <br /> During the peak, it seems that the villain will escape punishment, then go back down the stairs to get shot and do a wonderful job in the fence. That only shows this script has no authenticity at all. Avoid!
