This is a magical piece of storytelling. It has come about an hour in the film before we have a big idea about what it is supposed to be; characters often murmur inaudible. The procedures often seem to have nothing to do with each other. No one seems to be worried about who actually killed the girl; a pair of nervous children are swimming in water that looks threatened but nothing happens; the Irishman is punched in the face by one of his companions for no apparent reason ... The continuation will be as boring as the movie itself. The only semi-interesting element is landscape photography. But anyone can steer the camera in the Australian Outback to get memorable footage. In general - bleak and incoherent and patriotic - and an annoying outright to waste a lot of viewer time.
