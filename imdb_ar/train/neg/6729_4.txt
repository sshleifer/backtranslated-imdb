Obviously, many people really like this, but I found that from childhood and reasonable step, they were saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and two memorable musical numbers, especially the opening (but there is a significant decline in the later invention). I do not face with Monroe - supposed to play dumb blonde does not interest you, but she comes stupid. Russell can not be completely convinced when she claims she has not been in the gym, but is fairly wonderful. The men are not terribly interested, as is the plot. No way terrible, but incomplete so if this is classy, ​​God will help us all.
