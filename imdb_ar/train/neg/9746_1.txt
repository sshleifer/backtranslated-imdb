I remember this film, the show in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week. Although it may sound wonderful, and I can not explain why, this film has been shown in a theater dedicated to ... movies of art and great quality (ie, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and .. The Downed Man). Few people saw her (fortunately, no doubt) and can not find any reference to the very boring SF film in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopedia, or the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember that, after all these years, no story, a lot of special effects that look silly effects in fact, nothing more. It seems that in some countries the operating time is 90 mm. In the brothers 77 minutes. Well, that means more pain.
