No, <br /> <br /> Basically, you can see something meaningless. In order not to spoil the film for people who really want it, take a look at the click I'll explain. <br /> <br /> A normal everyday woman walks down the street and then finds herself driving in her own car. She followed up and talked about many events during that period that she and her family were involved in. <br /> <br /> I have specifically commented on this movie, how terrible it was written. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story did not make it anywhere - it could be added to a large extent and turned into a global pandemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by doing it, usually you get most of your questions at the end of the movies on the answers, but this film asks, what just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes just passed for nothing. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> They had this space between two dimensions (our dimensions and behind the glass) that would come to our world and kill us. Not all of this was explained during the film, and you never know how it happened, why it happened or when it happened. Nothing explains during the film. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the film, the man who finally filmed everything must be escaping away (her main sisters friend) main but unfortunately the film ends after 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, and then I took it right after .. Do not waste your time. I really hope nothing like this will happen again.
