I've seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the rise of its mud; face-to-face collision between two cars. A plate smashing on the kitchen floor; humans live like animals. <br /> <br /> But I have never seen anything as bad as a cat in a hat. <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the 911, worse than Hitler, worse than the Vplad the Impaler, worse than the people who put cats in microwave ovens. <br /> <br /> It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easily. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a joke, some complicated jokes and that Mike Myers was probably a high-dose drug addict containing cocaine added to the betting bet that lost a bet or something. <br /> <br />
