1 being very generous here. I really enjoyed the BOOGEYMAN, although it is not really BOOGEYMAN upgraded on DVD cover and we all know it! I've been crawled. But this film, is another thing. Looks like he was shot on a VHS camera by a 10-year-old camera! The story and the ugly representation! David Hess, you failed me. After playing one of the most dangerous villains in the film's history, she resorted to this? However, it may be possible to overlook the story and acting, if anyone has taken the time to make the video seem rather professional. There are a lot of stills on the videos that do not look the same, or at least not so clear that it distracts you from the movie. I can not say that it's the worst film ever, because I could not get it out of the whole movie, but it's certainly close.
