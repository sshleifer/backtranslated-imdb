While I was growing up with the Beast Wars Transformers, I was not familiar with the original converters, and now that I've seen the wonderful movie, now that I've seen the old cartoons on it, I must say I like the original animation and live motion film more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> I do not like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> I mean, "Auto Convert and Dip!" Looks much better than "MAXIMIZE MAXIMIZE!" The original Optimus Prime voice still makes me a strong believer that it is a real leader, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much stronger than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron appeared in biological weapons as a comic version of the evil version of the original series. <br /> <br /> Besides cooler, robots change into animals or robots that change in vehicles and spacecraft? Jamie's original Transformers on any day on Beast Wars!
