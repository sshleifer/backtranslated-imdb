I have never seen a comedy that was supposed to sit in it ... no one laughed at it. Well, maybe a little laugh in the movie Michael Duncan Michael Clarke like the big bald black pristine. But the rest was shockingly amusing. In addition to being free of any laughs, "acting" will last forever! Stay away from this one if you appreciate your time and money. Awesome !!! the worst!!!
