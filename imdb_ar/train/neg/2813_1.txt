Normally, I will not rent a movie like this, because you know it will be bad once you look at the box. I have rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare at Elm Street 5 and 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home I discovered that the video gave me the wrong tape. In Wes Craven's New Nightmare, I found this lame movie. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly boring, the representation is bad, the plot is meaningless. It's hard to write a good evaluation, because I have no idea what the film really is. At the end of the movie, you have more questions then answers. <br /> <br /> In the "Maximum Power Scale from 1 to 10" I appreciate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to review Corinthian's correct (down below) saying that Robert Englund is dismantling underwear and riding Naked horses, etc. The man who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
