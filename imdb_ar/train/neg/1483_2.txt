I just gave this comic horror a ridiculously titled 2 flick because many famous porn stars in the past show it. A group of tourists, supposed to spend their vacation in Ireland but in Canada already, are hiding from something mutant carnivorous in one thing or another, and the plot has become more or less direct from THE HILLE EYES AND WRONG TURN. The only problem is, unless I calculate, there is only one boom shown, which is not all that admirable. The favorite mummy in this film is homemade about five years ago. Help some horrific but silly deaths, but the movie is a thoroughly amateur night and boring beyond imagination. The predictable end has been done to death. Intent is not intended.
