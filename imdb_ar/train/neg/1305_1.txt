"The Third Devils: The Ghoul" has no previous complementary relationship to "Demons" and "Demons 2 terrific classic horror in 1980." The Demons III: The Ghoul "is a very stupid monster, bored, cheap." Confused with the writer is "Demons III: Ghoul" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacete are a poor quality writer and stupid ghost William Shakespeare bored or demon egg from the spider web or what the girl Hoohoh dreamed of A very very very boring film, I bought your special DVD box called "Demons" in three different films called "The Third Devils: The Ghoul", "The Other Hell" and "The Dark Devils". $ 14.99 from Best Buy in Downey, why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacete Two poor quality writers make a stupid movie that looks almost like "Halloween III" and I do not have a Michael Mayer monster but people are dressed in Halloween.I am confused, I really like "demons" and "demons 2 better than dumb stupid" D emons III: The Ogre "Not part of" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 "are the same devils. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
