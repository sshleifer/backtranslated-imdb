This was not a bad film compared to the first two matches of the original. Directed by Martin Ketruser of Friday's 13th Fame. The acting is very bad indeed, but the special effects and influences make it interesting. This is what I like about Screaming Mad George, whose effects are out of reach, and will keep you watching a bad movie just to see how crazy they will get. The movie is not really quite fun, but there is a very bad scene that captures the eye in its middle and includes a game promoting (What!?!) Mickey Rooney makes the guest appearance that he may not have been very enthusiastic but needed money at the time, perhaps? If you liked the fourth batch of eccentric (my favorite of every 5), you might like this version. I love it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
