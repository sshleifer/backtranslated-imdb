.... ripoff of ten best movies. Especially the story of "The Los Angeles Story" by Stephen Martin, which at least was a boon to be clearly fictional even though she was playing his girlfriend then playing his girlfriend in the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, boys and girls are naïve, "20 Dates" is ironic, although I'm not quite sure that Miles Berkovich's intention was when he started. My impression is that he started the project almost seriously, then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless it made positions more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing has an unstable, cheap and unfaithful feeling about it. <br /> <br /> As someone cleverly pointed out, the film contains two "appointments" that sue and place restrictive orders on Miles and after appearing in the film, which would be impossible as it would require a consent form. It seems to me also that the majority of women who appear to be "dates" are professional female actors (the house not famous, except Tina Carrier) - obviously very beautiful, polished, skinny and frail in front of the camera being the average civilian. <br /> <br /> Mr. Berkowitz makes a classic mistake in choosing this kind of very fine actress, instead of taking advantage of a variety of believable women, which may have made the premise (even in the memorial) more believable and entertaining. He also skips what might be his real-world problem: that the character of the film and the real world Miles Berkowitz appear to be jobless (IMDb credits in real life do not exist in practice, except for this film). Even in the film world, his ex-wife divorced him because he was not hired. I think the scenes (not to mention Mr. Berkowitz's real life) deserve to explain his management of living in one of the most expensive urban environments in the United States, in a luxury apartment, driving a luxury car and eating at the price of restaurants when he does not see any source of income at all. (Do you have a drug dealer? Live with his wealthy parents? No idea!) <br /> <br /> You can stay away from anything in the movie, if the jokes are really funny. "20 date" is painful and funny for the United Nations. Mr Berkowitz's idea of ​​humor is to be his character, while at the restaurant's table, he tells his friends how the food he is given can either give him diarrhea or constipation - the worst kind of ugly childish humor. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising to discover that Mr. Berkovich did not make a film before "20 Dates" and that during the past eight years he has not made a single film or appeared as an actor in anyone else's film or had a writing or production Credit of any kind. The gut instinct tells me that the film was not funded by "Eli" (gang money man who appears outside the camera) but probably by Mr. Berkowitz's wealthy parents, or perhaps a shocking misuse of credit cards. Whatever it is, we can easily rest everyone that it is unlikely to see Miles Berkovich or any of his creative efforts again. Praise be to God!!!
