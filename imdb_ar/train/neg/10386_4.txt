Can this be interesting? The story of a haunted house set by Japan from the perspective of a newly installed American family? But it is still stable due to the simplistic treatment and disrepair of both actors and directors. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the modern renaissance common to such local fare, the fact that spirits prove to be evil without real reason but it is expected! Besides, do not give much in the fear section? Giant crab attack is just silly? Since ghosts generally inhabit a certain personality and behave in an unusual way, such as Susan George seducing the diplomat / family friend, Doug McClure and Edward Albert feeding his daughter a pot of soup! <br /> <br /> At some point, an old monk appeared at home to warn Albert of danger if they stayed there? In the end, he called for the expulsion of buildings. However, history must repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation that has arisen properly ?? Leading to a violent climax but unintentionally funny where Albert and McLaur, owned by the souls of their Japanese ancestors, engage in an improvised karate duel to death! At the end of the day, this time shows the harmless squatter? Acceptable in only 88 minutes, but by no means, the display is necessary.
