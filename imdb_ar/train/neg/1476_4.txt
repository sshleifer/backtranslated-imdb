The swords and fists are an early presentation of John Woo's talents. Excellent cinematography and some really wonderful sword works. Unfortunately, the film is struggling with the burden of a boring story and a starkly low budget (check out some specific scenes of combat if you suspect me). However, it is worth watching, especially if you can pick them up in a message box.
