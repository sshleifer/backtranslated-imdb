Istanbul is one of those films that Errol Flynn made in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay away from the IRS. It's a new version of Fred MacMurray-ava Gardner in Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike the studio producer, Istanbul has the advantage of this great movie site right at Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who grew older in front of the camera in each film, was so old that he no longer played these kinds of motion / adventure. His scenes with Cornel Burchers really lack conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays the role of his former girlfriend in Errol, who is now suffering from amnesia through a shock saved from the fire. She does not remember Errol and is now married to Tory Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some bad people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who were after some diamonds in his possession. You should also deal with them. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a jazz performing pianist, just understand him as a singer. In fact he was a pianist first, he was singing a late idea. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine motion / adventure film for those who love this kind of movies.
