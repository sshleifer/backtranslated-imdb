Steve Martin must resign from trying to reproduce classical comedy. He certainly does not fit this part. Like a sad remake of Out Of Towners, this movie falls on his face. How anyone thinks by Steve Martin can come close to Jack Lemon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same applies to this film. Dan Akroyd could play Belko better. Martin is wonderful at performing his original characters but has failed miserably to recreate the classic work of other people. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of the movie is included in the first line of credits when the movie ends. The line "Producers gratefully acknowledge the lack of US Army cooperation" around the only line that made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, continue to show the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake which should not have happened. This film was placed in the same category as the classic Lemmon movie and re-released Psycho. None of them should happen.
