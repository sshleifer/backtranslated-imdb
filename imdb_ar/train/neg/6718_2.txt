I wanted to see the film because of an article in the film magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The story is different and I'm sure it would have been a good movie if it was in good hands. The steering and acting were awesome !! I had a feeling of watching a film produced by a group of amateurs. Although the film began promising, it became worse and worse. I think this is a non-original movie with embarrassing characters .. I still think it's worth watching since I have never seen gay pornographic films. Do not keep your expectations high though, you will be very disappointed. * Away from the place *****
