Quite simply this should not be. It's predictable and clich√©. The on-screen chemistry that made my first film, "My Girl," is so captivating that it can not be found in this place, and that acting as a whole is tidy and compelling. Writing also leaves much to be desired. Some "memorable" lines such as "barbaric ear imitation" are just a shock. "My Girl" raised real feelings of sadness and some real funny moments, like many of the sequences "My Girl 2" trying to re-create these feelings generated by the audience, and failed miserably. I may be difficult in this film because of how great the first film was, but frankly, the quality of the original is of interest to you with the kind of driving that this batch offers. This must certainly be approached by the "Son of the Mask" as one of the worst results of all time. In both cases, the old proverb says true; "If it is not broken, do not fix it."
