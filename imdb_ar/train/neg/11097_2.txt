This is exactly the kind of Saturday series I liked during World War II. I was under the age of ten. This is the audience that was designed for this series. When looking at it now, one must cheer up with uncertainty and stupidity. The budget must be next to None, given the abbreviations and duplicates. the acting? Well, these are pictures of the Republic, 1944. They read the lines .... no doubt one would take them to make them convincing.
