Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folkloric, but want to be international. This results in unprecedented results such as this movie. <br /> <br /> The film contains jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and has no meaning to non-Turkish audiences. Even for the Turkish masses after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even hilarious Sensei has a worse performance than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. So Cuba is believed to be a banana republic. <br /> <br /> A waste of money, a waste of time.
