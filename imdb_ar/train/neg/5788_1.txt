Well, then Mr. Agrama (who is involved in some dubious work with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a wonderful, fragile blend by Mr. Karl Musk. <br /> <br /> What is this terrible carburetor? I'm talking about? Well, Masque took three strings of Japanese animation unrelated to science (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada). TONS added that the American public is too dumb to understand the virtue of narrative and art of silence - it was edited by adding some metaphysical Mumbo Jumbo described by using some of the worst vocal actors this aspect of Hell's representation (he was singing Reba West - and still - unbearable and total anger, especially compared to Lady Mary Iijima) ... The result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity problems And the loopholes of the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, the mica was great to look at (especially those in "Macross Saga") and the parts of the plot that remained intact were good. But all that was good at Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "vocal talent" he recruited. It was because of bruises and efforts (not accredited - why? I would be too bold to accuse HG of literary theft here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who got wind from the real deal eventually and compared the original versions with Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The original versions are much better, of course, much more logical. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, has shown nothing worthwhile: the legendary creator Leiji Matsumoto has prompted a campaign to protect Japanese animators "intellectual property from unauthorized and unprecedented rework by people without Skills such as Karl Mask.
