I usually know after the first minute of the film whether I will hate him or love him ... But now, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning was fantastic; "It depends on a real story" Blah Blah was a funny thing. After that, the cartoons drew me and described the lives of the men with pictures to my belief that I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Next, seeing Toronto's ridiculous fake look was fantastic. Also, it seems that the status and appearance of the house confirm my first thought. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the first 10 minutes of the film ... which later seemed immortal. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is that I do not understand Canadian English humor (that's possible, English Canadians also do not always understand the spirit of Quebec), but hey ... there were enough things in this short film, . Maybe this could be the meaning of the title? Anyway, everything was almost full and there were very few things that were very close to my opinion. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was "made" better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind it that made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; that's why I hired the film and took care of something "the disappearance of the annoying people". But so far, I did not know that the whole universe would fade, and with him even point the film. <br /> <br /> If you are an English Canadian, you can appreciate local humor, taking into account the amazing number. Of the people who made this movie to 8. Otherwise, just think twice before you waste your precious time ...
