Good people, I stumbled into this evening film while I graded the papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has done that kind of honor that he deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least attack I have ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This science fiction version is classified with Christopher Lambert's version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did not I like? Cgi for one. Surprisingly bad. More important is the sincerity of the story, not to mention vulgar representation. I'm used to all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Pleased regardless, Peter
