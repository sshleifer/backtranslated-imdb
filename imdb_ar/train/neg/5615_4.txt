I watched DVD 1 only. Proper software may have 10 minutes of good information. Otherwise it's the wrong layoffs of the religious. It seems as if director Brian Fleming recently discovered both atheism and ridicule, and feels these tools that he can easily undo his opposition. <br /> <br /> Fleming also travels extensively on his personal issues and takes charge of a film. The subject never returns at all. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to dismiss skeptics when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in abusive formation. The arguments of these victims seem irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religion people will need more data. We do not need to tell us that religious people are bold, and we should not be told more than American Jews how to get annoying Christmas music by mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the director of the Christian Childhood Fleming School is facing the director's insight on his motives. It seems like the most honest part of the film, and it was very short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming is more aware of himself, he may have a good story about his life (past and present), the relationship with Christianity, and the abusive institutions he received in his youth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he could have loaned "Christ did not walk on earth" to a more dangerous documentary. I do not study the writings of Saul / Paul to see how narrow this is, but the quick review of Wikipedia indicates that most of these arguments have lost credibility. <br /> <br /> The additional interviews are good, so they do not support Fleming's thesis much. Sam Harris is a good speaker on behalf of the anti-religious POV, and does not highlight other religions other than Christianity. Harris also has some good interviews (and ease of Google) on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
