Well, I love bad horror. I especially love the horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to ridicule. It was not severed. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat in the entire movie, and I have a number of comments, both in this "suck" style and in the real world of criticism. <br /> <br /> The plot (kind of) - there's a person in this city (probably Seattle, see comment below) who runs and cut off the heads. He has been doing this for more than a year (I will not go back for exact figures - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. One head per week. The police are now only calling a "specialist" (someone refers to himself as a psychologist, but this will never come again). <br /> <br /> The true Xia! The Fed keeps after, what, three related murders? After nearly the same homicide, we will be under the amazing martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, this "specialist" consults with the voodoo chick, who is ignored by the police all the time, and the two of them have come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, the spirit of the voodoo, who cuts his head to get enough strength To make himself a body (and then assumed to take over the world - or perhaps go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Mother. <br /> <br /> Setup - where does this happen? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not realize that in the bar / delirium (which is occupied by about 10 film staff and family members), there is a poster for a local radio station, and it is very entertaining, dialogue dialogue "Pulp Fiction" IF) between the two conditions (yes, the two people who cut their heads in about 15 minutes of the click) discuss the "new stadium" which may still have been a problem when the film was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize on behalf of the film and hang my head in shame. <br /> <br /> Well, here's where it becomes so important - as a horror film writer (unpublished, not looking for my name in IMDb), I do a search. Lots of research. Unlike the book of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while the Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards graves and is traditionally associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a scammer "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not cut off the heads. <br /> <br /> Moreover, much of the voodoo religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious celebrations centered around the possession of many members of the community by loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that if someone already owns, why create a new body? <br /> <br /> Also if Baron Samedi got a body, he would not cut his head, get some rum, fresh cigars and more !!! <br /> <br /> In short, the only thing they did (amazingly) was that reading the Tarot card was absolutely unnecessary (used only to show that the Voodoo chick was "scary") did not explain the card explanations the way most movies do . Again, I've done the research. (Anyone who remembers the late-night ad for tarot readings by phone - "Lovers - will fall in love madly soon ..." And all this nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you do this through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I would be more sad if I felt the need to watch the movie on my account, so please do not do so.
