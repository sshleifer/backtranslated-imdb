This was a really bad film. The character Cole played by Michael Moriarty was the main reason for this failure. The actor felt that invoking an incredibly embarrassing southern bar would make this character even worse. After about 20 minutes I wished the speech processor would appear, it would add some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) Behaving badly - 2) Non-sympathetic characters - 3) A fine plot line for shaving <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
