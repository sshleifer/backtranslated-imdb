Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very powerful plot, but has been destroyed with cheese details throughout the film. I am a younger person and I did not enjoy this film very much. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might look amusing to young children. Movements matrix destroyed work, you know it was completely false. Then there was the "Yen Lo," an evil spirit that temporarily possessed people and returned to the country where Wendy was seeking to win. Everything ends as a good model film when Wendy and her cousin, the Buddhist monk Shin, succeed in defeating Yen Lu (and destroying him forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson ... Blah, Blah, Blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
