After raping his teenage girlfriend Harry Reims by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems becomes resentful and treats himself with some lesbian sex. At the same time, Colt, who has been carrying dresses and dresses like the magician, is raping more women. In the end, Reims decides to follow him and end the frenzy of his crime. Although filmed in the film marginally poorly, it looks like any pornographic act of the 1970s and is performed inefficiently. Rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly restricted and try to take advantage of the laughable "death wish". T. Paula ("cannibal holocaust") plays the role of policeman. Colt, who is usually above the top, wiggles in a few sights, but behaves very well against my money. This roughness may be much more harsh.
