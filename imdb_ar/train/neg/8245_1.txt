I can not believe anyone who likes this movie. I've seen a lot of independent low-budget movies, but this film has been fully absorbed. A low budget does not mean that the film should be malicious. Horror does not mean that the film must be hidden. There was nothing scary about this film at all. It was just a gore festival, and particularly disturbing in that. The acting was mediocre, since they were not all heard by the actors, but the story was pathetic, and the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to come "technician" or something like that. This is not one of those truly brilliant films that cost only thousands of dollars for their production, but has been done very well. This was no more than an excuse for some very sick people to put their harmful concerns into the film. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked ... because most of them were written by one person, and some songs written by a movie book. There were no substitutes for this film at all. A complete waste of my time and money.
