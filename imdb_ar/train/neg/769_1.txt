The main disadvantage of this film is that it is impossible to believe that none of these people will be filmed in the professional production of Macbeth. Hearing the sound of soft David Lansbury who was struggling hard with the famous "tomorrow's villain tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe that anyone would be seen in this role. I kept believing he did not get the role because he was a bad actor. Not because a larger name was available. Then when we see parts of the play rehearsal, it is hard to believe that the director is not making fun of things in the wrong way hopeless, or a false image directed at actors who can not express the verse and directors who see the play or even understand. Explanations. In some cases, filmmakers are keen to make their films (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own businesses) to settle for less. This seems to be an example.
