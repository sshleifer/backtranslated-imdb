This film failed to present anything new to the genre that traditionally showed a love story across the cultures supported by politics in the mid-20th century / India before the Second World War, where the British and their modern ways are bad and the genuine Indians are genuine and good. Surely such vulgar perceptions of the British are now fleeting. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the drama that feeds the second part of the film, the story is predictable, the representation is pedestrian and two-dimensional, the director is clear and imaginative. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be revealed and definitely benefited from another half-hour of screen time to give the characters and narration more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in. <br /> <br /> All in all, somewhat uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roach can not do the tragedy - do not serve me feeling emotional pain.
