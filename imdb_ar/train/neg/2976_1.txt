Miraculously, this is actually checkered. I mean this is bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad, it was very bad, but it was very bad. True, this is enough faint praise. The production values ​​are corrupt in all areas, the representation is unjustified and the Romero-Wanabe satire can not think of any aspect of the environmental fence that makes fun of it. The inner logic takes a back seat to the heads that expel themselves from the refrigerators. The incubation times fluctuate according to the "plot", the lead that works against the zombies or not, or the zombies who have the power of speech. Gore is obviously a draw, but the frame is very difficult. It seems that the dialogue has been translated by the same computers that spoil instruction manuals, and the scope of the zombie does not include any of the films Romero. Everything topped with a terrible synth score. Absolute garbage.
