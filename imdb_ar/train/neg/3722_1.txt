I remember that I was forced (yes - literally forced) to watch this film by a preacher of Southern Baptists when I was a kid, and even then I loved him. It is designed to scare poor suckers until they are "rescued". The only thing that "saved me" is the fact that it is finally over and I can go out and live a real life. <br /> <br /> See the chapter on this film in Sarah Diamond's "Christian Right Policy". A wonderful. And certainly more interesting than the film!
