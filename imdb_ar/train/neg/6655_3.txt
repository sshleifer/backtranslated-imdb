The only quality to recover this accumulated melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascori singing the song. Stephanie Bowers makes a mistake and betrays a false accent. As has been pointed out, they are larger than to play 18 years and look very small as a grandmother with a granddaughter at university age? Lee Remick is good though she is a young permanent in her last years. The gifted Joanna Lumley is unexploited and is able to search for young people forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Euresh) marries Grandma Stephanie Bowers. Stacey Kate's relentless arrogance makes you wonder what these women have seen. I do not know how any scenes can be associated with excessive filming? The most credible performance is presented by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the actors look like amateurs. The credibility of the faithful male kidnappers in this epic will remain unbroken as they patiently await the subject of their emotions to finally accept their acceptance. Can anyone believe that handsome Robert Euresh will remain alone for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept the never-ending marriage proposals? WW2 clash between Wehrmacht and Marquis funny. First of all, the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until the late war, and were controlled by the French government of Vichy. We see the French resistance raiding in broad daylight on Villa Mistral to steal the lids and then prepare them all under a bridge waiting for a truckload of Nazi forces to surprise them and destroy them? If you want to see a good mini-series in a foreign country, do not see Mistral's Daughter. The best alternative is Thorn Birds.
