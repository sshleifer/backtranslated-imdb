This movie is one of the reasons why the IMDB allows a 0/10 vote. Representation is appalling, even praised by some here, a disastrous personality! The script looks as though it was written in haste. In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind said, when Buck was asked about the meaning of "dan7" in the computer graph, "Daniel 7, * Chapter 24." It might have meant version 24, but the filmmakers made a mistake in this slide. Perhaps the worst part is that the location of the eschatological film is incorrect in the Bible. While many Christians have adopted the film's interpretation of the events of the end, this interpretation, in my opinion, * is wrong. To understand these shortcomings, read "Christians will pass through the ordeal" by Jim Mitter and "The Blessed Hope, A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and Ecstasy" by George Ladd.
