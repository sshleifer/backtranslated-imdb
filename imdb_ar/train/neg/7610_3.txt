Overall I do not like the movies directed by Sydney Pollack (the "company" somewhat excluded) and I was never a fan of Robert Redford either. However, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" should be good because of the number of annoying comments she received. <br /> <br /> Although wide-screen photography is entirely eye-pleasing, Max von Sydow does a wonderful job as a wicked killer, I found the entire case very disappointing. The film undoubtedly radiates the atmosphere accompanied by paranoia, but everything is destroyed by the muddled conspiracy that does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I've ever seen and that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can one say about that ridiculous romance between Redford and Donoway? Best watch any of the Hitchcock movies five consecutive times instead of watching this piece of trash again.
