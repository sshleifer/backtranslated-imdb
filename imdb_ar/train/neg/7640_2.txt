I basically found that the Eden curve was so bad that it made it difficult to see. However, there is something I have to say about how the director took on something about the atmosphere of the 1970s in choosing settings and clothes. The philosophy of "return to earth" and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that were not highly decadent, as described in many subsequent editions of the 1970s, as in the "do not ask do not tell" counterfeit liberal-educated brothers of the East Coast, only I thought that this was more likely for the New England school instead of a school in Virginia, where I imagine that the "good boy" mentality still dominates even elite schools like this one. Another thing I value and can relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not much associated with the removal or withdrawal of property, and estimated some homosexuality roles not associated with these excessive images. I felt that it was very unfortunate that the "gay culture" took certain standard forms in the 1980s from Castro and Christopher Street, which identified this movement and left huge numbers of gay men who were quieter in their lifestyles. I mainly appreciate the film as a way to remember the natural way we talked about our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene".
