I can not believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave it an "AA" rating, and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, but from the books it must be denied access forever to any means of communication. The plot is ridiculous, and the motives of the "bad guys" are completely absent, and the various family interactions are silly and shallow. For example, my father preaches that the aggressive reaction to the aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be a "wonderful" person not because of his philosophy of "ignoring the idiots", but because he is very good with his fist ... <br /> <br /> It was the only message that I was able to collect from this page is that the nuclear family is good and that alternative living arrangements are bad. Oh, bad people happen to good people.
