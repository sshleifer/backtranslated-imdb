from where we start. This film began as something that looked like a piece of "Dark Falls". A distressed old woman living in the forest, giving gifts to children to their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls," I killed you fairy teeth only if you saw them. You killed the fairy teeth in this movie no matter what. Why do they need rock, girlfriend hippie or popas and their sister? I think the film would be fine without them. The producers seem to have sat down and decided they need to put additional people into the film, making the tooth fairy kill people. Although it is good to see a beautiful blonde girl is not portrayed as a bubble head for change. Well, but I do not suggest buying it.
