After a long time in space, looking for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Roth) returns to Earth. He misses Lewis Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and his son was born with Richard White (James Marsden). At the same time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) paints an evil plan, using the crystals he stole from the Castle of Solitude, to create new land and flood the United States. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, who never forgets, or television shows such as Lewis and Clark (and Terry Hatter) or Smallville, a great prediction was created for Superman's return in this version of Brian Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts and a lack of emotion and exaggeration in IMDb. In addition, romance between Lewis Lane and Superman is ridiculously ironic. Actress Kate Bosworth, 22, is a serious mistake, playing a mature reporter and an experienced mother of a five-year-old. Brandon Roth is less than two years old from Tom Welling, who plays teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville". The character of Parker Bossi, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a ridiculous caricature. Last but not least, despite being a wonderful Lex Luther, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old and therefore older and bigger than the rest of the acting team. The comfortable conclusion is like the soap opera which is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
