Well the reason I saw her in the cinema was that she was an intrusive preview, otherwise I would not watch this bitter bitter teenager movie. I mean do not we have enough of this yet? Screaming and scary film at least did not take them seriously self! The plot sucks, the representation is the worst I have ever seen. (Godzilla can only compare, which is the only film competing in being the worst I have ever seen in the cinema with this movie.) <br /> <br /> There are a lot of holes in the story, and the girls are very similar, so you have not even Now who killed and who did not. (And you do not care.) Dennis was the only one I knew in advance, and she was the most talented actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Away from this movie possible. (2/10)
