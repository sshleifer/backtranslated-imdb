Unfortunately, this has been shown on Star Movies here in Thailand during the past week or so. It's a complete garbage representation. As another member said, this film is a good example of "how not to behave." I have not seen a film acting very badly for a long time. Actors (can you call them "actors"?) Are perfectly flat and their lines eagerly advance a dead dog. I would like to say that in order to truly understand the extent of misrepresentation, you should see the film ... but this will be closer to torture. <br /> <br /> I cringe because the leading lady is presenting her lines, and the rest of the actors with their accents (fake or contrived) are equally ugly. She was another actress with a pretty fake British accent, yes, but Mr. Saleh had a terrible accent. Combine it with a little representation and you have a disaster. He should have said nothing, and I could have accepted her as a pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the master lady lover says "Really I?" After the scene of forced crying of them. laughable. No, really, I laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> Groups and art directors offer some of the film's ultimate grace. Some groups are colorful and some scenes are fairly nice (minus actors). <br /> <br /> Lady of Ancient Magic Gravity? What?! Another member of the song "Modern" love that was in the film. Is not quite appropriate for a section that was identified about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered a "big budget" in Thailand at the time of its production. I will be seriously disturbed if you are the producer of this movie. It goes only to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even modest) film. <br /> <br /> I will give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and groups make the movie saves such a rating. 2 of 10.
