I've rented this movie for almost 4 to 5 years and I was disappointed immediately. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch B-movie Slick, but I ended up in Fancy. Representation was like watching grass dry. I've seen him act better in a famous film ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer did not come out of me. How was this horror film? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was funny at best. There were no worries. It seems that a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if it existed. If you're bored looking for a horror movie to rent, skip this movie. There are far better movies than there.
