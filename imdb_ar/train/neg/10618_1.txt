The film is extremely shocking and humiliates victims of rape. On the surface, it may be a daring film about rape, but if dug under the surface, what lies in the message is not very positive about rape. Aishwarya shows the victim of rape as a helpless victim who can not face everything because she is a woman. She needs a man to help her. When society voices bad voices and comments on it, it does not defend itself. All this is up to Anil Kapoor to do all the talking while Aishwarya weeps. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kushik) went the wrong way to portray a victim of rape as weak and submissive. What was more effective was portraying a strong woman who rebelled against her enemies in a courageous way. The director is known for being a chauvinist. His films are usually full of vulnerable women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the personality is strong. <br /> <br /> The most humiliating scene in the film is when Aishwarya cleans herself after being raped. She does this to please her father, who is now thought to be dirty. Although it is commendable that Shah shows stigma against rape victims in a stark light, what does not show us is whether Ashe's father was wrong in making his daughter do such a thing. Thus, we have a confusing message about rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not required in a powerful film theme like this. Even more, comedy is simply not funny. Wooden ash in its role while Anil Kapoor does only scream. The music is modest except for the title track, which is beautifully depicted (the only bright spot for this film). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and meaningless. In general, what could have been a wonderful film to remember is that Hrisa is so bad, which will give some viewers very indigestion.
