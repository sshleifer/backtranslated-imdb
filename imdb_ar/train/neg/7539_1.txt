Where do we begin to describe the general misery of the attempt to win the last Abbott in the film industry? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans, but Mr. Faddoul was by far the most laughable. You know the master of sedition, do not you? <br /> <br /> He is a colleague that no matter how stupid, lame, and incomprehensible film, he says "Gee, I do not know why everyone hates, I found it interesting." He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of curious curiosity. Especially when he smears it in the shape of a sharp Hitler in his upper lip and walks around the noisy house about the brilliance of science fiction, which features subtle veiled references to Greek mythology. He is also the man from whom the Wicker Man was made. No one can stand it.
