If you are to judge the film alone, the committee that gave the A Chorus Line for the Pulitzer Prize, and the Broadway fans who kept the war horse working for 15 years, were all a heavy narcotic, because a single sense is certainly not. <br /> <br /> What anyone had to think that Richard Attenborough was perfectly suited to this article quite puzzles me, but he makes almost entirely musical about motion, just sitting on the screen like a piece of clay. <br /> <br /> There is nothing satisfying with the original result in the way it was originally written, one of them decided that what the movie really needs is a brand new song to give the movie some icons. Thus we are being attacked for the Oscar nomination (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Well, surprise, the song Tenton, as well as the film. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
