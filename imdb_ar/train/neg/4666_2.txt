This film revolves around a Japanese woman who has an obsession with Arabic calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite strange. Failed to see any "sensual" or "dramatic" tones. The plot turns a form of ancient art into pornographic pornography. In addition, the scenes filmed in Hong Kong certainly depict bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the entire film, I still think that the "pad book" is insulting Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Pads" is a perverted but boring film. Stay seriously away from it.
