I saw a movie clip several times on the stage and I was excited. It looked like a classic thriller like the one made in the 1990s. He also reminded me of the fugitive films, the cat and mouse hunt between Douglas and Sutherland. However, the Sentinel is the most exciting film of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a television movie. not exactly. First, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, television movies may be very enjoyable at times, but this film is the opposite of having a fun time. It is not at all elegant and visually most important, the tone of the film is unattractive. This is not a motion film, there are motion scenes consisting of a chase and a clash. They are also not great motion scenes, but the worst is that these motion scenes are tasteless like the entire movie. The love relationship between Douglas and Basinger was very unnecessary. Moreover, the president's assassination plot is the most vulgar of the genre, but they insist on it. This is not a cat and mouse film as it should be. Although Douglas is very old now, he still has the ability to act in a thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is also a wrong choice, because you feel as if you are watching Jack Bauer and somehow, his character is one of the reasons why a movie like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course it is very negative or direct in this film, . The movie was not so enjoyable for me for a second, so I could not get some time.
