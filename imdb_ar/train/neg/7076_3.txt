Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems as fast as 150 miles per hour, and 150 miles per hour appears as fast as 250 cars. <br /> <br /> Okay. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog looks so strange that I saw Eraserhead, and the Eraserhead looks amazingly strange until I see Begotten. <br /> <br /> Begotten seems surprisingly strange until I see the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Racing lovers, there is nothing in every movie world like the works of Frederick Hobbs. <br /> <br /> Alabama's Ghost is nearing any of its films for a coherent conspiracy, and includes only hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinationals, . Of course, the Fabulous Woodmobile, scouring the SunSet area of ​​San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> The really amazing thing is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the ghost of Alabama. There are collections, lighting, hundreds of additions, fashion, lots and lots of effects. Somehow Alabama makes a very wrong ghost. You see some terrifying baseball game like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the strangeness can be justified on the grounds that it was clear that they were making the film from his head on Discover cards. But Alabama Ghost is made with a real budget, that is evil. I mean, I have a text about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods outside Tweedlers, and nobody hitting my door waving the checkbook - how did this guy get the money for four of the most horrible films Ever?
