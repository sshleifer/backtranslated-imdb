How do I appreciate this dawn of the sequel? All he does is throw the balls! Worst of all, they do not even compare the first installment of the series! Comedy suffers from not funny. Where did all the unintended laughter go? Work on paper is still very long. Bob Ocker literally saved this from a full stop. What is the next step, fourth grade: back to the first row? Er, it can be! Leave this on the shelf and plan for a trip to the All-Star game. This one had three very many hits.
