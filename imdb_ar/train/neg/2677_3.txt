It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, the humor coward, as well as acting. But after all, it's a soft basic film, which is predictable and it does not matter because what you really want is sex. Which made me face the biggest problem at all, hardly any of them. Making you feel like you're watching TV at 3am and independent movies are working and produced by a college kid not working in the industry. I've left a very long time waiting for a real sexy scene, and often you're thinking of something happening, then leave a comment. One (maybe two, or one with two parts) that actually goes to somewhere is very enjoyable though. Personally I can not recommend this unless you find it in a cash box for a dollar or two. If you're lucky for a good movie with a plot and good acting, you do not want it. If you are looking for a good soft lesbian movie, you do not want it too.
