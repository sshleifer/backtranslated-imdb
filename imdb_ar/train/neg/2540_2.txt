I thought I saw this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews and they did not exactly match. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study alleged foot scenes. I still feel confident that this is the film I've seen, despite the contradictions in reviews. So, re-evaluate me: If you like "B" from time to time, as I do, Return to Boggy Creek is the right movie for you! Whether it's a temporary sleep setting, a gesture to your favorite movie bomb, or just going out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, you will get a pleasant night of improvisation. Be careful! Is the legend real? I think we might discover that, along with a wonderful crew. Will there be any equipment failures at key moments especially in the film? Do we have a blonde hero, manly, young no chest hair? Will Technicolor technology continue in the entire film? You have to discover it yourself.
