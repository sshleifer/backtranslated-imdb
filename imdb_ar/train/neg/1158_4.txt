Tenants are struggling two authors to complete their books in a residential house free of all. At first they help each other and then slowly begin to build tension between them. <br /> <br /> This depends on Bernard Malamud's novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they were in that novel. Very little dialogue is normal, purple and full of meaning. It is as if the College of English is devoted to a head full of arguments and wrote the script. It's terrible and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame because the film is full of wonderful performance from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is a good shape, unfortunately, none of them can hide the falsity of words and premise. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this film. Although it is not really bad, it is very exhilarating and so patriotic that you make you want to get away. I lost interest less than a third of the way and I had to struggle to get to the end. If you are interested, I will try it on the cable, but I will not put good money to see it.
