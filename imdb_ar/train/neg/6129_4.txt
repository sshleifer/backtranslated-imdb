Based on this film and the STRONG MAN, which was produced the same year, I did not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of silent comedian actors. There simply is not enough there. He may have been on the way to developing his style but seriously sabotaged his first major successes seriously. In any case, all his tricks remind us of more geeky men, but he lacks the acrobatics of ketone and the wonderful creativity of Lloyd. He also undermines his personal character by wearing clothes and walking like Chapel Chaplin's character. His trademark is an infantile innocence, timid approach and tendency to reactive the disaster by looking puzzled, hitting his eyes or touching his lips follow up with the tip of the index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films produces the fate of throwing many obstacles in his way and tries to overcome them in cowardly or naive ways or with minimal fitness, such as throwing stones at a hurricane approaching to drive him out, supporting a building collapsing with two or four rocks or evading Lift the leg so that the roll is under. In this story, the son of the shoe maker who joins the cross-country race to spread the shoes of a rival company, is able to win a big chance. Nothing here has not been better achieved by the Big Three.
