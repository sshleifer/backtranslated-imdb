We had to go to a date, so we ran DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?". He shook his head no. I said: "You made me see the end of this film and I have no idea what just happened." He did not "make me," but you know. <br /> <br /> The film itself was very good. There was a lot of suspense. Keep you wondering. Then came the end. The end was ... well it's over. You did not let what happened or why. Right up to the credits I kept thinking about something to explain it, but it did not happen. So I came here expecting to think of someone and I was not interested in it. Both. Here four years later, I was as ignorant as Tom Sawyer was. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what happened. I'm glad I did not waste any $ $ to buy it because I'm sure I'd be upset. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! Understand it! The end of the film is what disappeared! ROFL
