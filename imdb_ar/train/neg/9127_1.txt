Well, here's the basic plot. It is 1933, and Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived for a long time. The film begins with his birthday celebrated by drinking a special elixir (so the film does not mention) prolongs his life. Well on this occasion, the malicious Elixir is dropped by the Kato assistant if you remember the Pink Panther films and asks his followers to go and look for 6 rare elements to make the Ekser. This creates a global man hunt for his followers to steal museums of diamonds and adventure in London, to meet Nimes Dr Fu, a retired Scotland Yard Neyland Smith detective, also played by Sellers who is trying to stop him in what is supposed to be a comedic adventure. <br /> <br /> This movie was "Sellers" with his latest full length feature film before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who are a talented comedian and have memorable "funny" roles in the movies of the tiger, especially in the movie "The Concert", is nothing in this film. This film was absolutely torture and I could not complete it. He died completely and I kept swaying while watching the sellers' performance. After the great work of "Being" came a year ago, how do I mean, how can he do this and how he did this thing until he was made ??? Just as one person mentioned, the first ten minutes and 15 minutes are fine, but then all DOWNHILL ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
