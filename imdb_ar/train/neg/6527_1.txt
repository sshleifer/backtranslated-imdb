Certainly, a television show on Saturday morning was not bad for children. After all, these producers had to rely on the audience that returned. Well, in this horrific offer, they can at least calculate the money they have provided to groups. The script could have been rejected by a long-forgotten space opera series, along with some deadly lines that were added for the gentle Gerald Mohr to Noura Hayden's grumble. No director could do anything decent with such a kind story, so this procedure is not boring but boring. Props silly space ship - Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example - but the planet sets must be some of the worst in the history of cinema. Most of them are raw drawings, and are all immersed in a red light that is often unorganized. Even the bare hair of Moher is used as a pillar. It's a bad idea - a thin rib like a plot. Any viewer who can reach the end of this movie will hear a message from the sage - and probably quite agree!
