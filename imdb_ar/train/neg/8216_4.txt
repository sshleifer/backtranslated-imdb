Perhaps, as Fred Sandford used to say, "one across the lips". So for those who have made this film to an audience they have no doubt. Perhaps the person at "Rue Morgue", which he called "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently taking a short house from a high school football game, are lost and stopped to put directions in a small shop in the middle of nowhere. While he is driving, the driver accidentally bumps into a parked SUV and fires a headlight, but the girls decide only to leave and not go to find the driver. But the driver came to find them, not only that the headlight on her car had dwindled, but for another reason that the girls did not understand yet. When the driver first grabs her, she (yes, she) shouts a bullet and makes her strip, and continues to yell at her, "How far have you seen?" Of course the girls are scared to death and do not know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> As night falls, girls in the cat and mouse game end up with a four-wheel drive driver, who manages to inflict all kinds of injuries on girls who have the ability to shoot guns and screwdrivers where they do not want to. In the end, they found out that something had happened again in that store after they left and that was the reason for this woman's mental anger. In the end, they have a chance to take revenge and seize it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> There are elements in this film that are disturbing and somewhat frightening, but unfortunately, those moments are being undermined by misconduct, bad dialogue, and huge lapses of credibility. A girl was shot and apparently shot, and she felt cold, and her life passed before her eyes, but she improved? To what extent can a small car operate on an almost empty gas tank at 80 mph? I need one of these things, it seems to be getting a great number of great miles. <br /> <br /> There should have been an end when the girls got revenge, but the film goes on for a short while afterwards, and it is anti-climax, but they at least learn some of the disturbing women, and the driver is still concerned about "spoiling a car Her mother, "which is obviously less worrying to anyone. <br /> <br /> So this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's so amateurish it's still good, but it's so scary and sometimes awful to be absolutely horrible. But it takes a lot of evil hysterics and you will want to put ears on your ears if you see it. Which, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 4 of 10.
