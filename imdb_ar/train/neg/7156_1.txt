Dooohhh! My Bowen Hearts! Well, it definitely happens after this endurance test for the film. How I managed on Earth to continue without hitting the Speed ​​Button Master just ahead. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm !! Maybe I do not get the premise of the film ... or maybe I do not appreciate it's mysterious ambiguous atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although the film has a mystical atmosphere like a trip to McDonald's. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were all appalling and there is a more personal twist in Tom & Jerry's cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do that? Why do I watch this shark? Enough to make one escape and join the monastery or foreign legion !! YAARGH !! The film is very wonderful in every respect. Apart from that not bad.
