Roy Rogers plays the role of Jesse James and his likeness, Gambling Man Clint Burns. George "Gaby" Hayes is the former Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gaby. Gill Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a prominent team, as reporters looking for stories about an out-of-reach protagonist. <br /> <br /> Of course, false identity / plagiarism is a development plot, since Rogers' "dual role" articles. Rogers is charming as usual. However, there is nothing that actually raises this performance - any potential to deliver unmatched performance in Jekyll / Hyde is done with bad material. The couple to be seen are Ms. Storm and Ms. Bay as journalists in the St. Louis Journal - two of the highlights of the film. The songs are good, though poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James in Bay (1941) Joseph Keane ~ Roy Rogers, George "Gabi" Hayes, Storm Storm
