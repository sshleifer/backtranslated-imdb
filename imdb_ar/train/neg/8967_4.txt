The same path follows most sequences. The first one was wonderful. The second was mediocre, and this film was full of bad representation, stupid dialogue and also the suspension of disbelief, and this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and I could not bear that Henry and Rincler-style boss with that dumb eye, there was so much they could do with this. I liked the first one a lot. I wish they had gone more in these lines, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of inexplicable reasons to explain, how long was it and why was there an old-fashioned phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another phone in business. <br /> <br /> Blah!
