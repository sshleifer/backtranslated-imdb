Hunters hunt what they think is a man through the jungle, although the public sees it as a werewolf. The fishermen do not seem to realize this, because after being shot, it seems normal when he cuts his head. <br /> <br /> The doctor implants the eyes of the wolves in a man who has been appointed in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, fucks his nurse (Stephanie Petton) even before removing bandages. <br /> <br /> After he left the hospital, he found that his wife was also cheating on him. When the smoke machine sends clouds through an amateur board of the moon (with a fake tree branch on the front), it turns into a wolf! His trunk grows bigger, his shirt splits, and a giant wolf's mask grows on his head and shines red lights in his eyes. His trousers remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, although some kind of robot (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows gives it a pale appearance sometimes. And that's pretty well done. There is even a good head cut later in the film. However, when the man drops from the high, the bad puppet will perform the task. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, a kind of hidden malice, and stumbles accidentally through a small man with crutches called Andrews who is also such an expert. They try to help him a bit. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who have made a mistake. Check out a police homicide and try to hit Betton, who does not care much about lesbian scenes, so none of them come. <br /> <br /> Very cheap, but between nudity, blood and trouble, not an awesome story gathering (kind of) the most dangerous game with the hands of Orlock and Wolf Man, it's pretty entertaining. Available on its own, or in the Set Scream Queens Vol box. 1.
