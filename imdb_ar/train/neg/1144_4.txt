Bottom line: Dr. Markoff developed a new theory on how to produce energy, and knowledge that could shake the world. He keeps his knowledge encrypted and secret and wants to get out of the Soviet Union. KGB on the other hand strongly wants new technology. Therefore, they develop a plan in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB entered Markov to a secret location and was tempted to reveal his secret by saying that they were in Sweden and working for the United Nations. As a backup, KGB kidnaps Markov's scattered daughter. CIA now sends its best clients, a team of (Ninja) (Swedish?) To frustrate the KGB and save Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult movie needs to be seen. The film is very ambitious but lacks many areas. First, it's very dark, maybe hiding sites and bad influences, some of the scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what's happening. The second thing that is lacking is the martial arts, despite being a ninja movie. Sure, there are some, of very poor quality, but mostly the ninja releases automatic rifles or sets of bangs. Automatic guns are also a problem as they appear to contain an infinite amount of ammunition. The ninja appears to be immune to bullets as Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What is he talking about then? The idea and ambition above all. In fact, especially for the Swedish film, the scenes of decent movement, though not martial arts. Some slow motion scenes are nice, blood and gore. And some new and interesting weapons technology that make the heart or brain explode. Mostly all the parts you're looking for in movie B. <br /> <br /> Since it's definitely a B movie, no mistake can be made there. But if you expect it, and watch it like a B movie, it is entertaining. But do not forget, it's not just a B movie - it was set up in the 1980s. Some girls, for example, besides wearing ... are saying "interesting" clothes, deadly doses of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In general, see the state of ritual and ambition. Enjoy it, then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
