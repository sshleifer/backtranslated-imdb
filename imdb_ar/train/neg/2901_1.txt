The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on IMDb just makes me realize that the hard team is working hard in trying to get people to watch this absolutely awesome movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, no idea where I begin to describe the really horrific film that I had last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in the previous films led me to believe that I would feel personal and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was very fabricated, and the family was Walton's family of cookies and the movie was over and over again before I was shocked because someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a favor and get this very bad movie. I think everything you read on IMDb since the first comments were written clearly by people sitting in a different theater is watching a good movie.
