I imagine that young people who took part in the making of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" as well as a host of other titles) must have felt strangely in a series of horror films with the man who co-authored with John Houseman: Cradle Will Rock "); people are afraid to think that foreigners were invading (" World War "); and directing and writing in the greatest film of all time (" Citizen Kane "). Now Orson Welles was a third-rate heroine on satanic worship. <br /> <br /> There is nothing creative about this film. Lots of nudity, but background music always proves to be distracting. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it was not worth watching. How low has sank Wales. Fortunately, for the last 13 years of his life, the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoon cartoons of the 1940s) was co-hosted by the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Pamela Franklin and Michael Untkan starring.
