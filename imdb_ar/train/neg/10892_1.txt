This movie is awesome! I do not know where to start, I'm speechless I can not even describe how terrible this is. Blood is fluorescent first and foremost, the representation is wonderful! The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, and I do not see how it can get a single sound. It seems to be made by high school students.
