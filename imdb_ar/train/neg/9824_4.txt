I was not familiar with American television stations. When I pressed this on my husband's cable, I thought first that it was just a low-budget science fiction film, and after a few minutes I began to think that he might be smart on satire of the worst fundamentalist Christian excesses, , These people are serious! It's been some time since I've seen something unwittingly. I was reluctant to write a review for fear of hurting the faithful, but then I saw reviews and other ideas, hey, they could take them. The difficult philosophical puzzle: How do you make a film criticizing films without showing what you are already criticizing? Answer: Make it in a way that makes the only people who will appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you criticize. I suppose that some liberals (Laugh !! silently when you say that!) May be insulted by the disdain of filmmakers for those who are obsessed with the public and who are not obsessed with the myth of J **** C *****, but I did not mind - it was Cool!
