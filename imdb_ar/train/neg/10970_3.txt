This is ridiculous - apart from his Australian colleague who reviewed this click, I can only believe that anyone else who has submitted a review so far has been involved in some way in the production of Elektra, taking into account how generous they are in their praise. . <br /> <br /> Admittedly I'm not fond of comic book transfers to a movie, so I did not expect much of the expectations, yet I still find Elektra disappointing. The thing that made me more upset was the fact that there was a lot in this film that went uninterpreted, which made you think, "Hey, what is the connection that has to do with the plot?" Or "So how did this aspect of personality happen?" I can only hope that these things may be explained to some extent in Dardeville, and I have no intention of seeing it. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it seems that the characters' behavior in this film leads to random moments to match a story, so as not to make me start about a completely useless romantic sub-plot. I also (still do) scratch my head on the fate of Kari-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have passed without explanation. <br /> <br /> If I could give fame to this movie for anything you would have had to be the wonderful locations that were filmed in it, but I gained little enjoyment from Elektra. I know that we are supposed to comment on our disbelief of fantasy / motion films, but almost everything in this film was improbable or confusing (even according to the standards of motion films) to the extent that it simply frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
