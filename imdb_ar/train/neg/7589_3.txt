What do you expect when there is no script to start with, so there is nothing the director can work with. Hayek, Farrell, Donaldson and Kirken are good actors, they have nothing to say or anything to say. So the earthquake was so bad. I do not know how close the film is to following the novel, but two of them appear to the Jewish girl from anywhere, so it appears that Arturo has a nice and warm heart, but some stereotypes do not amount to anything. He even buried Camilla in the desert, instead of returning her to Los Angeles for a beautiful Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once a while. Pathetic. The L.A. Ironically. Anything good? His window felt curtains, sounds and wind. Donaldson is always wonderful. It has been since the jinn or the night of the living dead, whatever.
