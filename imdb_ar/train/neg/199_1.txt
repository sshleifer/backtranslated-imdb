This is a terrible film, a terrible script, a bad direction and a meaningless ending. Also, the performance is bad, except for Clancy Brown who has been illegally exploited here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was antiseptic - you can do this to unload enough of the bad karma movies to see a really good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie features a father and son who seem to have been unable to do so. Part of the male lead is not well written and seems non-energetic in this role. You can see plot points a mile away. Female lead behavior and actions of her brother, cop, are also meaningless. So, any major action on its part at the end of the film makes no sense.
