I give this film a promise that it is well made and behaves reasonably. And because I could not go beyond the truth of it all. <br /> <br /> First of all, the game is based on the idea of ​​"Russian Roulette" which must be filled in an hour. The big problem is that if you make a "live" offer, you are running the possibility that your first contestant will be unlucky in drawing the "real" shot. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes of supply to fill and nothing to display. The corollary is that well, up to the end and keep the top five contestants, which means that the number six has lead and can not get compensation. He will not shoot himself at this stage, so he is kind of anti-climate. <br /> <br /> The second problem, almost big. Human nature. People will give up panic and panic and take pleasure in their underwear and do things that do not produce good television. Plenty of random. This is why the "real" reality television is actually written tightly, and it is edited more tightly. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is to glorify the "performer" about women's sacrifices, which were historically rare in fact predictable, as they went by shooting themselves without any effect.) > <br /> We believe that bid ratings will increase as they take place at 1 am (unlikely) with the Asian token showing a girl announcing each batch in the ratings. <br /> <br /> A point on race and sex. Surprisingly two big films of the minority (single gay) and two runners are the ones who survived. So we are left with white males, of course, a little less of them is the person who buys them. The purpose of this presentation is that it is random, but the person you least admire is the person who dies. <br /> <br /> Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for suicide, Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and starred in this thing, so she has no blame except herself) actually grows his conscience when someone dies . What will she do? She was shot instantly by an angry passer-by (she never explained the motives) and the show continued to be a great success. really? <br /> <br /> The problem with spelling media is that it must have some basis in fact or it should be more ridiculous (eg network). This is not the case.
