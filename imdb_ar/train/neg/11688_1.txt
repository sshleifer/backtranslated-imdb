My wife and I found this movie very unsatisfactory. While the plot keeps you interested and preoccupied with what happens, when you leave the theater, there are a lot of loose ends that make no sense at all. (Spoilers before) Christopher Plummer, chairman of the wealthy New York Bank has a terrible hidden secret. He takes advantage of World War II from the Nazis and hides the stolen goods from the Jews. He keeps the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe deposit box at his bank. why? If he does not want to be revealed at all, why did not burn documents and destroy them years ago? And diamonds? Obviously he does not need them - why keep them instead of getting rid of them? How did the bank robbers discover his secret? How did they know about entering this safe deposit box 232? Ace Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing that SD Boxes No 231 and 233, but 232 is curious. Time was precisely found in one way or another to conduct an exhausting search for bank records to uncover this bizarre fact. All the time dealing with the status of a hot red hostage and threatening bank robbers to start implementation for a moment. Wonderful! Talk about the great powers of the talks. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose coins in the vault they have opened. They only take the contents of SD Box # 232, ostensibly for the purpose of extorting the bank head. This challenges any rational attempt to rationalize what the film depicts as the mastermind of the crime, or to his followers who have fewer brains. <br /> <br /> Judy Foster, using her political connections with the Mayor of New York City, gets permission to enter the bank which is under the control of bank thieves while holding several hostages. She offers to steal the bank's deal to buy back the documents he now has in his hand, but he does not care about them. So what is his point of view (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife has been insulted by the arrogance of all players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (Investigator EES), and Judy Foster, in the face of the shooter's problems of high-power problems. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's last film, "Flight Plan," was full of meaningless holes. I thought I loved Judy Foster, but I would probably avoid her future films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that he rarely convinced my wife to go to the cinema. I can not disagree with her about this ... "expense of money, waste of time." be cerfull. Good movie setting, good actors, poor script writing.
