This is the only reason I have this DVD. Now I have not seen the first movie Nemesis, but I've reviewed the information from him and here I say: What? why? Because in the first film Alex was a male. But again, the first one was set in the future, so maybe this is a new Alex, may have happened to make Alex female this time. Who knows, at least not dealt with in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of this plot: Alex, still a child at the time (or how far he wanted, as he was, in the future) ran away with her mother using a private time ship and ended up in Africa. 1980s. There the mother is killed, and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. The tribe is then slaughtered by Cyborg of the future, then Alex runs and hides, and finally kills Cyborg. So there. Does this seem familiar, right? <br /> <br /> Terminator is no longer the only movie being shredded here, and Predator got its fair share too. I think that Fly's first movie, Vincent Price, gets a special film nomination to give a solid base to build your cyborg head from. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what? Well, the film was a small budget flicker, but it had a particularly bad effect for the mid-1990s. It seemed okay for the 80th dusty ever. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the craziest part of the cinema I'm happy to see (?) But it's very close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting. Let's be honest here: Did anyone expect Oscar's worth doing here? Well ... at least, I found that Sue Price is hot in the way Amazon Warrior. <br /> <br /> Rated "real": 2/10 There are not a lot of pros about total quality. Despite the very basic plot of the film, it is largely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Camp rating: 4/10 I have occasionally laughed because of the film's extreme chaos, so its small size has advantages.
