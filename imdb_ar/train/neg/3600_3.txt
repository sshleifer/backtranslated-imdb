A question for all the girls there: If you have never met a man you have not contacted by mistake and have continued to do so in the most unfulfilled moments, do you care about him or frighten you if you call the police? Yes that's what I thought so I could not swallow the idea of ​​Marty Gerrard with the unwarranted interest of Connor Hill <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a story Really stupid. Conor Hill's wife is killed and the circle revolves around the question is Conor talking by phone with Marty so he can get an excuse? But there is a huge gap in logic here. Was not Connor using a successful man? Something that seems to be ignored. Was there no criminal evidence at the scene of the murder? Why is the entire trial based on Connor's contact with Marty at the time of the murder? Mute Mute Mute and predictable as far as it is mindless. <br /> <br /> My constant memory of this film is that the person who made the Winter Olympics Marty Gerrard is really a downhill skier.
