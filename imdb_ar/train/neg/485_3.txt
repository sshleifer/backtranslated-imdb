When I saw the preview, I thought: This will be a great film. And indeed it could have been. The actress who plays the main character has been very credible, and the beauty of photography can not be denied. But dialogues darken the entire picture. The language level was very familiar and very modern in an event held in 1610, and captured most of the film's charm. However, I have to congratulate the translator, because the subtitles in English were more accurate and appropriate to the original French sermon, and may explain the good rating the film got on imbd!
