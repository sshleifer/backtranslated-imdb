Let's just say I had to comment less on Spider-Man than I did with the troublemakers. That means I have a less problem than I think Toby McGuire can stick to the buildings more than Elijah Wood in Manchester. I will not go into details, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea that sophisticated and professional British men are getting close to the clippings at the end of each week is funny ... and this is not the case. Fighting, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken seriously. The seriousness of greed, the reverence that is dealt with by the subject becomes troublesome, because it does not establish conflict or solve it. It seems that the plot, with holes large enough to drive the Guinness Truck, was slapped with the theme "Fish out of the water" so intrusive that viewers can look into the eyes of the tedious Woods when he learns how to become a man. . Other young men from football tasted sharp objects and then fled as quickly as possible. The characters are caricatures, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character line and the storyline are developed to the viewer during the photo. Unfortunately, the film's absurdity does not reach its peak until almost the end, which you will have spent nearly two hours of your life will never return to. Take the "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this disappointing fog. Do not waste time with the empty melodrama, "Old Yankee in the court of King Arthur", or the heavy proverbs, which come from the nonsense of the times. It is pure, dark and intelligent fun; the way violence is supposed to be.
