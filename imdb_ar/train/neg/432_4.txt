This film had the potential to be much more than it was. But not only fails to achieve it, but also propagates self-proclaimed frankness at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Kozak is more flattered than he was in the middle of the night in a park of good and evil. The difference is that this time it is supposed to be his southern accent, which is markedly lost several times in every scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is doing a chit but seems to be walking around in this movie and collecting a check. It is as good as usual but barely occupies a prominent position. <br /> <br /> Supporting representation - the romantic romantic interest that added little, if any, to the story. When talking about the story, it is a story of "who really cares" where Kusak is a self-righteous mayor boy who just has to find the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not act from here. The personality of Cusack loses all credibility in the end, which without being revealed, is preaching and nausea. The last scene makes the penultimate oddity look deep. It is also quite inaccurate, but I will not turn to law. <br /> <br /> This is bad, through the movie numbers. It seems interesting in the first 40 minutes, and then it's really a preacher and self-proclaimed film in the last hour. Better off with the reckless folly of a pile of junk.
