Leave it to Paul's "Sex on the Brain" Verhoeven to arrive at a flimsy and up-to-date version of the invisible man's story. If he directed a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into a kind of huge orgy. I do not mind having sex or even corruption (see my other reviews) on the film, but frankly, the director obviously has one track mind and he can not see interesting aspects about the invisible man's story of the strange effects that come with it. It is shameful that it would have been good if the film had not spent much time getting the invisible women of Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br /> The cast can play a game through the one-note, but I'm annoyed by some of them, including William Devane, who is completely lost here. <br /> <br /> But then, what I was expecting from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, however, is more entertaining than this vulgar and bad film.
