This movie is "installation", but the same way the car collides. Hard to look away. In general, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - a futile and biased experiment. Directors are manipulating and seem to have no problems going to the lowest possible level. The way funds are provided to Ted is pure exploitation. The step-by-step that Ted's filmmakers forced to take part in (a meeting with so-called experts) was empty and devoid of any real attempt to communicate with Ted. Instead, it is painfully clear that she is working on covering the filmmaker's posters and continuing to exploit Ted's situation. The worst of it is that the filmmakers stopped following Ted six months later; they seem to be completely isolated from the subject they followed closely months ago. If they cared, they would find "experts" better to help Ted. If they really want to see what Ted will do, they should let him spend money without any interference. This film is at best a Jackass stunt high and not a documentary film. It is sad to think that $ 100,000 would have already altered the life of a homeless person if it had been placed in the right hand.
