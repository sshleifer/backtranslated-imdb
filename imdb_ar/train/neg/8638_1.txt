Movement, violence, sex and coarse language are the things that characters do throughout the film. All they do is for no reason. Mark L. Lester knows his violent films (without reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters very well ... I do not say they are dumb but I mean they are very bad representatives. It is another low-budget motion film. If you see something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot or Sanctuary or something like the bad movies of the same kind of Misbegotten ... do not hire them ... by the way do not rent any of the movies you mentioned .... give it 1 and a half of5.
