The first half was OK, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny that the producers admit they have no idea what the end is, and it has already appeared. What is really sad is that I have to write ten lines of comments at a minimum so you can publish this. I did not really want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks because the show is not really worth the effort. When Battlestar Galatica came out for the first time, I was very excited about the possibility of achieving a better remake. This did not happen in the first season because it was obscene. In the end they cleaned it up a bit and they actually had some nice drama, so I started looking again. But to end the series by being an angel of the Cyclonic god, the same was true of the Baltars and six idiots.
