This film is simply not worth the time or money spent. Filled with clich√©s and a meaningless plot at all! I can not believe that many people have given this terrible film 10. I think they were surprised by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> If I can give this movie zero, I'll do it. IMDb too bad does not allow this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw him was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see him. What is sad is that I did not have any great expectations of this film at first, yet I felt a short change. Take my word, do not waste $ 8 on this piece of trash. The only entertainment that came out of the film was a mockery of the director's name. In all, not highly recommended!
