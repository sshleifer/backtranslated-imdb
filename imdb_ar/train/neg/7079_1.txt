There is no reason to bother renting this flick. From the opening credits, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft, animated film, but in reality there is nothing exciting about it. Looking at the world of sex addiction is interesting, but to some extent. <br /> <br /> The boring sex scenes, the bad plot, and novels by Ed Bigley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this film.
