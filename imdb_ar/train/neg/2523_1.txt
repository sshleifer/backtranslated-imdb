R O B T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burning the teacher. Very terrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no closing. <br /> <br /> The worst movie was ever created. <br /> <br /> The film "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" is replaced as the worst film ever. <br /> <br /> I hate this mess that has not been completely processed, unedited, unregistered or unproductive produced by something called "Robot Jox" - and I've just discovered - they've made it again! I apologize to Adama Sandler (Zohar The Beautyin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for their dislike for their films. This mess in something makes these movies very bad - not terrible and terrible like this thing. This is the only movie I have ever said - remove it from NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 of 10 people found this review helpful.
