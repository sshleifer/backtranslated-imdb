The film is very slow indeed. There are some beautiful pictures but can not outweigh the fact that the film is actually boring. You see sexual intercourse a lot of watermelon and sexual intercourse while eating melon maybe a little more. It may seem interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for two hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh several times but really are not enough and may be more of despair and disbelief than pleasure. To disturb boredom try to put a few videos in the movie. They are really colorful clips of silly songs, perhaps from the 1950s, but it's hard to say exactly and trying to be so funny that it's really sad. You have several times the feeling that the plot can evolve into something, that a strong scene is created but in the end it evaporates somehow and that's it. Beside the clips, there is hardly any dialog boxes let alone the music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally I can not recommend the film. I think art is something that should not be boring. During the show, there was a yawn throughout the cinema confirming my short evaluation health.
