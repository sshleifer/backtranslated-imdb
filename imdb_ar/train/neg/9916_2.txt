Justin returns home to live with his father's strict and unbelievable detective, but my father seems to have turned the top floor into three temporary apartments, each with its own odd tenants. Justin, idealism with straight bishops, penetrating into the world of magic, murder, underage drinking and other treacherous things. Ho-Hum <br /> <br /> Wow, have you watched the same movie that almost all other reviewers have seen here ??? Intelligent, persuasive, original, intense, intelligent, genius ???? !!? I have not seen any of these things. What I saw was a horror film with a low budget, monotonous, very vulgar, mature with the possibility and lack of tension in the least part of the time, where the killer is sent to the film immediately after the monologue / debate / discussion. Where are these laughable moments? I was never disturbed, probably because I was too busy and I did not try to sleep because of the film. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield Second comment with various contributors as well as isolated musical tracks; 4 features (made, in group, converted one room to 4, inside the black circle); interviews with Rose Feliza, Desiree Gold, and Rene Brown; alternative scenes of blots. "Shock-o-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "Millennium Crises"
