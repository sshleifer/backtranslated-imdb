Lost train. Wrong phone number. Extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when making a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people do not think about it because they are absorbed in their thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> Happenstance tells the story of mutual relationships and the cause and effect of this mundane. A group of ordinary Parisians. It contains all the components up to contemporary theater, with a full range of disjointed and delusional. <br /> <br /> There is a deceptive husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic boxer, a haven, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. Audrey Tutu works as a previous protagonist (meaning she's in the camera like everyone else and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl can not find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the day you learn from a stranger in a train that your turret carries. What happens to her during the day is listed through different personalities. Has expectation become a reality? The concept is good, but the storytelling is dim. Communication from one event to another is weak. There is a better story in 15 seconds of Liberty Mutual insurance where someone sees something good and passes it to another two hours of Happenstance. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice the time of this movie, but you will end up dissatisfied and wonder what this story might be like if it is dealt with by a better producer and director.
