Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately, no longer guiding his strength. I had high expectations about the film before I hired it and maybe that's why I hated it so much. I admire Spicy's attempt to produce a film that happens mostly in one small place, but it's not an important attempt. I found the film tedious, boring and extended. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Senis has performed much better, especially as he is aware of most of his other films. Skate Ulrich was a disappointment, but this was one of his first films (I got a kick from how this star looked yelling and obesity). The only thing that impressed me about this movie is the one shot of the car wreck from the top. The central line of the road was completely centered and the camera moved along the line and overtook the debris. However, that shot was a "very usual suspects" and I think Spacey got the idea from that previous film (which is very good for you). If you want to watch a wonderful movie happening in one small place, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have seen him before filming this.
