In short, the gaps are filled with more sub-points than Swiss cheese. The director and co-writer says he wants to mix the genre - in this case, drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mixes like vinegar and oil. To take off, the comedy is not very funny and exciting. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken with regard to the legal system in committing French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of escaping drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on the big TV at home and found myself screaming in the film to move forward. In the end, I finally redirected the last long speech one of the main characters had made to his former lover's son. By that time, I felt confused by the lively humorous plot that deals with a dead lover, a remarriage and a lover's lover. Sometimes the plot turns into the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - either Ismael or Nora. At the expense of the public, views continue to change from Nora and Ishmael, where her former boyfriend was bound by his will at a psychiatric hospital. There may be two interesting films here that have not been developed well. The conclusion does not end with many sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness even though her real-life conditions are equal to her chances of getting ice balls in hell. Representatives are doing their best and attractive, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring errors of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
