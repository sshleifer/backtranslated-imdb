I saw my book on the wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Beckall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just bloody bloody - was supposed to be a charming millionaire putting him on an airplane - and instead came like a jerk from the floor the plot was stupid and full of bullets , And the three threads had no "romance" any chemistry. Dorothy Malone somehow won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress - although her tedious Trumpha character was boring - I think the big sister of Splendor in The Grass is full of charm and bitterness and lacks charisma. Director Douglas Cirque took a full look at the dialogue through a dialogue that seemed forced and the final result was a 99-minute waste. It was a veil for the actor who played the role of president in Get Smart
