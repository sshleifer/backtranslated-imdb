I've said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, yet no one will pay attention. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a great eye for Art Deco for the 1940s (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all of these digital backgrounds may really be the wave of the future in filmmaking. However, it is clear that the director was very interested in the digital presentation of his film, he forgot to shoot many scenes that would have helped significantly in this film is amazingly decree. (Spoiler) to shout out loud, they forgot to be the villain in this thing! Well, they have one, but he died 20 years ago when the movie is shown. Conran lacks his evil view. As far as work goes, well, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots one robot, two or three flapping wing planes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them !!!), and Robin, but He often spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or anything completely wasted in this film (the references that comment on her salary and Law's lack of chemistry are very true) and I'm a little tired of seeing frequent shots on top of the camera, showing that she only has two remaining shots, both of which are lost later In the film, one film is unfamiliar, the other very funny, although I saw him coming from 70 years. Nobody but Law and Paltrow do not have any important time on the screen, this is the real drawback of the film. The public does not sympathize with robots, they need a hero to walk around, and a nasty evil villain hates him. Without it, in addition to a good and attractive story, CG will not help the world.
