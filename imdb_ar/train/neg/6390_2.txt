I've seen about a thousand horror films. (My favorite genre) This film is among the worst. For me, the idea leads the film. So, even a movie that has been badly behaved at a low cost can be good. It is definitely something weird made cheaply. However, she has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene really is about the film. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
