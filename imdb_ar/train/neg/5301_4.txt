I bought this movie because this was Shah Rukh Khan's debut. I also love to see how he will do. I must say that he is excellent in his role. Deva Bharti is fantastic in this film. Rishi does a wonderful job. Okay. Alok Nath was good in his role. Ameerish and Mohanish also played their part well. He was also good in his little role. The inventors starred in an average film. The average direction is poor. The story is boring. It tells us about the famous pop singer Ravi. He has a lot of female fans. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi kills by his cousins. Kaagal turns into a widow .. to escape the cousins ​​Ravis. They moved to Bombay. I met Raja. She falls in love and gets married. Rafi is dating. The story is predictable. Its climax is predictable. The first half cavity. It also takes a lot. Saved by actors and music. Excuse the second half. The music is attractive with some wonderful songs. The cinema looks old, it's in the first half but it looks fantastic. Illustrations of the boring song except "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one rain song. Fashion is out of date. Any way it's only seen by actors and music Rating-4/10
