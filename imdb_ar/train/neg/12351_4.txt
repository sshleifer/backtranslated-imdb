A recent publication by a woman demanding a military background, which included the comment that "women's lives are no more valuable than men's lives." <br /> <br /> This slogan is politically incorrect, like history, as well as the presentation of neighborhoods. Communities have been able to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes at amazing speeds. Germany was ready to wage another war in 1939 despite the 1914-1918 war in which more than two million of its men were killed. In the South American War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay captured three neighboring states until almost all of its male population was wiped out but fought deadlock in the Chaco war against much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> There is no society, however, or has been unable to overcome the loss of women from the population. Only when the life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but has since never considered mixed combat units for its defense forces, despite the popular image of the Israeli girl. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is a Hollywood game.
