I have been a little tired of people who abuse the name of God to perpetuate their fanatical view of the world. Well, I do not rule out the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the anti Christ, I rule out the idea that only some people who live a really good life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to heaven, while the rest of us must suffer thousands of years of hell on Land, just because we were not in good enough condition. God may be cruel, but I do not think he will measure all levels of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.
