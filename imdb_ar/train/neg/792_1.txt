Thanks to the BBC for this offer. I used to suffer from the deficiency complex. I hated leaving the house and talking to new people. I had a great feeling that people hated me. But after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortune began to change. After Episode 2 I began to progress to new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I felt really talented. When I finished the series, I ran the sales department at work, which led to the noise of a large number of women and I often won my karaoke competition. If you are in a crisis of confidence and do not know where to go, make a trip to Pondland and pick up a 99-pixel DVD.
