What ends with killing this film is self-awareness, among other things. Here is a short list: 1. Unstable behavior. When the Beatles came and injected his trademark "unwanted behavior / humor", he was greeted as new. That was more than four decades ago. Skip it. <br /> <br /> 2. Wrong development. On the basis of the rule, the semi-social and political doctrine is a solid ground for success. Ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3. Postmodernism "I'm hard on this false world and yes, I realize it myself" Snake eats himself - used as graphics with another animal in the same movie! - Such a renewal. <br /> <br /> 4. smarmy, smug drollness. <br /> <br /> 5. Writing amateur, acting, direction ... Have you seen student movies? A victim of herself, the only thing I can say positively is that at least he has a sense of self, and Shish, and now I deal with the self-reflexive thing he imposes as valuable. At the end, it's just hollow loops like any other bit of humor - hey, you ever see Wooden Allen take the bergam, ie: "Interiors" ??? Well, this Just do more amateur.
