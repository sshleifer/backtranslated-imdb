The Spanish horror icon Paul Nashi starred in this film, one of his weakest films in the Werewolf ... but take with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under the title of the most common TV, the wrath of a wolves man, and there are many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a good chance, the most viable version I've ever seen is the WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, an unedited and complete European version that recovers annoying viewers and contains the original original footage lost from FURY printing. It is also written on two boxes. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays the role of Valdemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to discover that he has contracted a heinous curse and that his wife has an affair. She takes care of her and her lover while he is in the form of an animal, but he becomes a guinea pig for an exciting doctor and help her. Apparently, the document tries to "tame" the waswolf, and there is a scene of love Masushi very strange between them and Daninsky whiskers and young boys that fall under its inception, at least in the original. In the end, we get wolves for a price while Daninsky fights a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the film is that the director (according to Naschi's claims) was often drunk and the results were somewhat incoherent. When you see a MAN WOLF version of NEVER SLEEPS, it's not difficult to determine what's going on, although editing remains terrible in locations. Worst of all is the occasional mismatched footage of the winding zombie wolf that was passed directly from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, also known as "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") and mixed in this film without any reasonable reason! The wolf's clothes change from the black shirt to white and back again, and his behavior changes. At one point, the wolf wanders around in a sleepy trance of FURY, and then grumbles and roams wildly from BLOODY TERROR. Really weird.
