I'm not sure how close they are, but I'm almost sure that "Lost and Delirious" is a new version of this film (or story that relies on it). The scheme is very similar, and even some scenes and groups look very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so watch this movie instead. <br /> <br /> This film moves very slowly, but being a French film in the late 1960s is expected to be a genre. He told us retroactively from the perspective of one of the girls who visited the school. Editing the past shots with the current scenes is initially confusing, especially since the sound from each overlap (ie hearing the memories of the past while seeing the present and vice versa). Also, "girls" are a bit old to believe that they are in boarding school. Finally, there are not many personal developments that make you comment on the film.
