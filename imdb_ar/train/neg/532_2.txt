Just PPV'd this. I do not want to waste a lot of time on this, since most of the posters here put it in better shape than ever, but I wanted to say some things. I do not know which was more entertaining: Redgrave chases little mites and stumbles on her nurse; soon her wailing that her "precious" boy (who decided she and Mr. he was a drunk loser) may turn into a dead end; that deaf Anne designed with Bighi Lee; or CGI's terrible Crypt Keeper Annie looking at herself younger! <br /> <br /> I never took the Danes as the younger Redgrave. Richardson and Colette did not buy sisters either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wanted to be an actress, it would be better to get Mama to give her some lessons! I had no idea why any girl (or friends) made the fools of themselves over Harris's lively lover! Girls that are close and not studied like her, Locke farce behind the headache, and did not rot any of them! Evening gives the chick a bad name!
