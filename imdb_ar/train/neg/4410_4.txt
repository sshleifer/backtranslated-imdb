A typical motion picture: A good cop intertwines in a mess between Japanese policemen and gangs. <br /> <br /> The good result has good performances, a few moments of Snicker games, some fair business sequences - plus a chance to check out the brilliant Daniel Harris - who makes the most of her permanent alphabet as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** Out ****.
