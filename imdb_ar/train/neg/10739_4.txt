"Iedereen Beroemd" has everything we can expect from a live movie to a video. It's the story of a man who thinks his daughter can be a star. The only thing he needs is to make it on stage, surrounded by cameras and journalists. A simple plan that he must kidnap and do some blackmail. The problem with the film is not the basic plot, but how to make it. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it is not. It is trivial and disrespectful, shallow characters, the final sequence free of peak or passion. The last sequence is probably the only scene you laugh at, but just how pathetic you are.
