This has to be one of the best anime shows. And yes, I've even offered the "end of Evangelion" and that's what made me hate it more. Not to mention the countless ripping in this show! <br /> <br /> I do not mind psychic and philosophical reading, but Evangelion draws her to the mud as if it were something else! Many characters do not seem very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Otherwise, everyone was mostly a bunch of noisy losers. They need to go to the psychiatric center, not to experiment with giant robots against foreigners who are called "angels." <br /> <br /> Even the mica and alien battles did not help at all. "Well, there are these robots, which are really wonderful because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they are not really thick, but they are captured angels, so sometimes they get to do and do what the pilots do not want. Legal age, you must control them better ... Blah Blah Blah! "<br /> <br /> I am very sorry, but I can not recommend evangelion to anyone, anime or otakus. For those who love this series pretty much, well, you deserve this view, and I respect you. But for those who have an obsession "out of your mind" to believe that everyone will love this series, you are more than eye-catching. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run" -Dim and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
