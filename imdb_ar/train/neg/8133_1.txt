The movie is just as enjoyable as staring at the sun. Shaver Pataki is totally discouraged and does not like to do anything better than sitting on his fat buttocks making a puff of puffed cigars and drinking alcohol while the doctor acts as a zombie version of Nicolas Cage absorbs all the so-called "blood" that actually looks like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> It seems that most of the planning was so terrible even if this piece of film was called crap. The rest of the characters in this film are a waste of time, the ending was awesome, the outline was cheesy, and the scenes were awesome. What should I tell you more viewers there? My advice is to get a shot of rabies if you've seen the movie already. This film may give you foam in your mouth if you do not get updated shots.
