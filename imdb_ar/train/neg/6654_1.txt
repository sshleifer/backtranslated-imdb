Normally, I do not think that Hollywood productions are suitable to be called movies, so I call them "movies" instead. But this piece of elephant fertilizer, not even suitable to be called film, and then quotations in the title. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of aging molding, it is certainly an example. Stephanie Powers is supposed to play a person even less than half her age, and is supposed to play an 18-year-old role, and her performance is always !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible and stupid, stray image of Paris and France, where we see vulgar characters like: sympathetic shopkeeper, model queen, fairy goddess of the previous models, etc. Respect for the Da Vinci Code (correctly defined by reviewers was comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It's totally ridiculous to have no nudity in a movie about the time and place where nudity was a very common place, especially if the whole focus was on it <br /> <br /> 4. Harsh accents! <br /> <br /> 5. Music lifts Nana Mouskouri !!! <br /> <br /> I can continue, but I think that's enough. I was able to make these observations after watching this crap for only half an hour, while surfing the internet and talking with my friends about math equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
