The slow pace of the film may have been the filmmaker's explicit intention to convey what teenage life was like in a village in China. However, I found a combination of the slow "icy" plot and the overall impersonal photography style to the extent that they are quite strange, especially to the Western audience. Sometimes I had difficulty distinguishing some characters, since they were filmed from a distance. In two hours I was in the past quite care. As a person who is not only interested in music, but also interested in China's history and culture (and by no means strange to Chinese cinema), I was unable to interact with one character and found nothing to introduce my teeth onto. The question arises: If you do not like it, who on earth would want it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me a job about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This sorry effort just does not live up at all. I'll be sorry to see Chinese cinema control this standard.
