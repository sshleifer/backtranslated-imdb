"Gung Ho!": Carin's Makin Island Raiders, produced in 1943 to raise the morale of the American people during World War II. It shows better that cinema can be the propaganda body. The value of this film is just a collection and not a technical one. In a publicity film, it is futile to judge the direction and actors. Check out this movie if you're interested in how publicity works in movies or if you're a great fun for Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a movie of World War II, they are much better and objective. I rated them 4/10.
