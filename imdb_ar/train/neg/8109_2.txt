*** Contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it astonishingly boring and superficially made, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: since in the end we must die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way, such as Thomas; in a "heavy" way like Teresa; or should we find ways to not face that question, like Sabina? How important is sincerity in the relationship? How much professional life can be tarnished for our loved ones? How much should we participate in politics and social issues in our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read Cond√©ra's novel, but after the film failed me, I will certainly do the following: I want to understand whether the story has been destroyed by adapting to the film (which I think) or if it is boring from the beginning . <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that made the film a masterpiece. I simply do not see the reasons for that. What I see is many flaws, followed by a sample of them. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what they are paying when making their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) "Secondary" characters exist only to fill gaps but do not add anything to the story and wonder if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) Like how Thomas was impersonated. There is nothing good for him. It is centered around itself and selfish. It is not human, in a sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he is dependent on others and is emotionally attached to someone, I have not found the explanation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is unlikely that an artist like Sabina would be able to afford her lifestyle in a communist state in 1968. Moreover, all three major characters are very successful in their careers, which seems strange to me . A) How can Teresa become such a good photographer? B) How can they do it well in a country that lacks all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) False accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. I am not even the mother tongue. In addition, the message Sabina receives while she is in the United States is written in Czech, which she found to be very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) I praised several comments on the film saying that Prague was beautifully presented: I think most of the film was filmed in its location, so it is not difficult to give the film a feeling of Eastern Europe, Hard to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end a kind of trivial. Teresa and Thomas, are finally happy in the countryside, away from the temptations of "storm", far from the social struggles of their fellow citizens, separated from their careers, in a car accident. But they die after they realize they are really happy. So what? If they died unhappy, was the message of the film different? I do not think so. It was considered a cheap trick to satisfy the public. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the film is unbearable light is how the director portrayed the characters. You see them for about three hours, but in the end you have nothing left. You do not feel empathy, do not contact them, you've stayed there in your couch watching a series of events and scenes that have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated "stopping music in the restaurant" scene (which praised some of the comments very much). Why did Sabina get a strong reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina got a very bad temper and a strong personality. This is. What is unique and unique? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave them two). <br /> <br /> "Shooting naked women", where the envy, jealousy and insecurity of Sabina and Teresa are displayed. <br /> <br /> It is the other scene that represents the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza photographs, taken to inform the world of what is going on in Prague, are used to identify people involved in the riots. I found it perfectly original, and Teresa's sense of despair and guilt is portrayed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is little chance that the film is deliberately "designed" so that the "Thomas types" are going well for that and "Theresa of Them" will hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt that, however), I should review my comment very much.
