For Daniel Ottwell, Queen Margot was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, Paris, Texas was much better. The biggest disappointments were Chris Menges ("Chris Cross" and "The World Is Separate"), and Joran BrzejoviÄ‡ to use a copy of the same musical theme of "Queen Margot" for this film (attention to the end of the film). If this is an American pop film, I would not be surprised at all; but for an European film with more independent actors and directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without an original vision is very simple and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell minors. There are those poor children who hate people who sell them and are waiting to be rescued by someone. Finally, there is that great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from the bad guys. Each character is presented in simple black and white terms: good vs. evil. In addition, from the beginning, I understood how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of sexual abuse of children? I think the difficult problem of sexual harassment and sexual exploitation of children is far more complex than how they are portrayed in this non-original film. I think this movie was not annoying, but it was very disappointing.
