In the words of Charles Dance's character in this film, "Bollocks!" No plot, no evolution of personalities, and totally believable. <br /> <br /> Filled with things that do not happen in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with pistols in shoulder bags?). Filled with mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. The output / editing is horrendous - the hand-shaking camera shots that add nothing to the film but a dazed, dizzy feeling; confusing jump cuts; no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is not entirely sympathetic - why should we care about what happens to him? Directly to the video? Directly to the trash!
