I just took this film against Buck at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I felt like I was upset. <br /> <br /> I do not know I saw a worse film. Quite frankly. I will never write a negative review of a film if I did not respect this subject with great respect, namely Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what's this? It's a biography? Yes, a lot of melodies by Foster here and there permeate these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern figures, from which there is more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean someone paid to write this drivel? Second, the true story of Foster is a wonderful story. Why not even come close to it? Third, what did they get at the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this film? His photos with young boys? With the Communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, Foster friends, the truth, good entertainment, be scared ... Be very scared.
