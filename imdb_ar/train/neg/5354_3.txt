In the absence of a good plot, the absence of decent representation, the absence of good cinematography, and the absence of special effects of good appearance ... Do I need to move forward? The review may contain spoilers. Actors seem to read their lines, not good at it. Most "actors" acted as if they were in a second-rate play. It seems that the story was written by one of the second-grade students mentioned above ... not really all those twisted ... It is very simple and simple, where the person believes that they should lose something until they think it is wrapped. No, not exactly as simple as you think. I understood the movie, so I knew it was amazing! Most of the film was sitting people talking (reading their lines), trying to look evil. The narrator was annoying. The "special effects" were laughing. I love low budget movies. I also love Caroline Monroe, Tom Savigny, Jack Skary, and Michael Barrymore ... not only in this film ... you can say they did not get money, or they did not get a big salary, because their hearts did not belong to them were talent in it . I love Tony Todd ... however, it was just enough in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... Tony was in it for only two full minutes (seriously)! I would suggest offering a quick DVD to Tony Todd's 2-minute slide. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this "movie" for P.O.D and I had asked for my money. Hopefully the people who did this will do better the next time.
