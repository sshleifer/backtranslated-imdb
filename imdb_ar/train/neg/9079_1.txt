What are people talking about here? I have to see a different film about men. I felt so bored that I came out of the theater. What's up with these things. I just laughed once and not so hard. Everyone who shines this film must go out and hit the street. I usually find something I like about the film, but that's crazy. "Slackers" makes the movie "Not Teen Teen Movie" look classy. It ranks first with such trash as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst. Avoid at all costs! I thought the studio would distribute money to people as they left the theater as proof of their apologies, but that was not what dismayed him. It seems I will not see this money again or two hours.
