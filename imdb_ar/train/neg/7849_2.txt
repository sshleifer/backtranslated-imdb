After re-creating the film in recent years, the film captures the re-establishment of military surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks took place in the first film. The crew was killed shortly before the emergence of a group of soldiers in a training drill to find anyone around him. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of salary everywhere. There does not seem to be any passion for the performance of anyone, nor anyone behind the camera. It's a film made for money and nothing else. At some level, this should have been successful. It could be a terrifying southern rest (where the National Guard men escape from some people in the marshes), but rather not so much. In large part you can blame the script, which was written incredibly partially by Wes Craven, who hits the same old goals over and over again. Add to the chaos the fact that the trend is dull and that the preparation of sequences lacks gloss so that it removes any inherent tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, but it's bad-tempered and boring. Let me put my feelings in context: the reason I watched this film was because of local multiplexing and running this movie instead of having to reject another Mimzy child and I wanted to see why it caused the tears (I mean that the movies got so much common in saying sarcastically) . I am convinced that this film will only scare those who love Mimzy last.
