I like "Kissing on the Mouth" because of its simplicity ?? Pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from lead / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the reality of "private" daily events. Unfortunately, the film falls within the scope of "The Brown Bunny", though a slightly more sophisticated plot of jealousy. Yes, it reflects "Bunny" with nothing full, or many concentrated (or unfocused) movie clips on nothing at all? Feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film is screened and why people rent it: real scenes of sex life and full frontal nudity (equally, male and female). Otherwise, it was a complete waste of time. We soon get to know a partner in the room after college, where males have obvious feelings for females who see him as just a friend while constantly having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are exposed to the daily events of their boring lives: they work for their parents; he works on a project of sexual awareness not very interested on his computer. For all this to succeed, dialogue must be exciting and act real. It does not work and it is boring like watching someone drive for an hour, ie "brown rabbit". The only actor who stands out is Kate Wintrich, and even she does some dubious acting. (The extra DVD with her in front of Mike really deserves watching / listening to him). Again, I admire filmmakers, especially Swanberg, because they failed at all and were not afraid of exposing themselves or bathing habits, but in general the film falls. It contains stories that do not fit the viewer, and many boring and unconvincing daily events you wonder about, other than the pornographic pleasure factor, why you hired it.
