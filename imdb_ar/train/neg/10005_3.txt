The second attempt by a New York-based writer in less than 10 years to shoot a Swedish film - the first of which is "The Brother of Carl" by Suzanne Sonntag (made in Sweden with the participation of Swedish actors!) The results? Oscar Wilde said better, referring to Dickens' "old curiosity shop": "One has to have a heart of stone so as not to laugh out loud when Little Neal dies." Pretty much the same thing here. The "interior" is chock-filled with a long tajweed. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Given the middle distance: "I do not like who I am"). The guiding quotations (to use the polite term) of Bergman are close to parody. A family that is not incredibly involved continues to remind us of its brilliance and talent, to the point of suffocation. ("I read a poem for you the other day, I was in - I do not know - the New Yorker magazine." "Oh, it was an old poem, rephrased.") Far from being indifferent to these people, however, I found them very hilarious. Much of the dialog box looks like the funny things in Allen's previous films - he just directed his representatives to play the lines straight. Because he did not throw himself into the film, poor Mary Beth Hurt copied both tics, convulsions and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing alternative (much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - the dysfunctional family with the domineering mother - seems to have been lifted in one way or another from Winter Light, the fundamental family melodrama that has been deceived with much existential concern. All this comes through visual / audio tricks that are worn in the store: the silent scratching of the pencil on paper, the high waves dwarfing people walking on the beach. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's subsequent "serious" films are less embarrassing, but they are also less entertaining. I'll have "internal". Woody seldom made a more entertaining film.
