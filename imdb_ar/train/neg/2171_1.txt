Surely this film contains one of the strangest subjects in history - there is quite Ed Wood's emotional defense about wearing clothes in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Thread: Play the bridge. Park Avenue Group is running; bohemians run it. The Russians - who speak "Russian" are highly questionable and have very unconvincing accents when they speak English - play it in the restaurant they work in. <br /> <br /> If no one is interested in the bridge, one - despite the wonderful cast - is unlikely to care much about this strange film. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lucas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is a ghost writer unlikely - because Lucas Rossi is unlikely). But they all drowned through the pagan script.
