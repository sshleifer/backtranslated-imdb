I saw "Get Off" last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and were very disappointed. Disappointed because the storyline was likely to be strong, Rosario Dawson's vision of a smaller, sexy film was exciting, but I'm a fan (late, I'm not!) Of the "rape / revenge" bout of the 1970s. the movie. My conclusion: Let's stick to the classic! Yes, the story has potential, but the dialogues are flat, and the actors are unconvincing. So Dawson is empty. Some may say that it is a true portrayal of the college world in the United States, and that the vacuum of characters serves a purpose and all this jazz, but makes the entire film immaterial. Just like the scene in which Dawson is being raped: he is sorely lacking! I did not expect anything "irreversible" but still, are not we supposed to feel sympathy for it? I did not. Not for a minute, it was very lame all the way ;-) I read that the photography was wonderful. Well, it's really good but nothing new too. I must admit that the show at the festival was not good, so I may have missed something here, but at the end of the film, I could not help thinking "I feel watching Argentino's Inferno again ... Haha, most importantly, It was beautifully filmed, but I felt bitterness when I saw a longer and duller version of the scene in the filthy strip near the Canadian-American border at Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with me ... red and blue raw lighting, heavy bass music, / Decadent ... No, I just could not get into this movie.
