This film revolves around Tyrannus, the wrestler who has been brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, the gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn about an hour later, also called Demonicus. This adds the depth that is strongly needed to the scenario and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus fulfills his list of small tasks (killing some people and repeating Latin phrases) by possessing the body of a university man. He uses a magic helmet to control the mind to do so, the university boy willingly puts him on his head, and then at several points in the film, sets off and reinstates. <br /> <br /> Maria has oral sex on poor man Shaun and Willian Scott, wearing a Terranus Globerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason, and it seems to have been sitting next to CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Absolute misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Look.
