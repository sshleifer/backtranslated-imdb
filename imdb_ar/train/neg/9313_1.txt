This was by far the worst horror film with a low budget I have ever seen. I am an open-minded man and I always love horror film good. In fact, when I rent movies, I'm particularly looking for some very well-off horror movies. They are always good to laugh, I think I know, I have seen a lot. But this film was very terrible and was not worth the sharp laugh. I was thinking of turning it off in the first five minutes ... which probably should be. There is nothing good about it, first of all, camera crew suck3d A $$. The intro was as stupid as the end. The effects and special effects were awful. Please I beg you, do not watch this movie, you will hate it completely.
