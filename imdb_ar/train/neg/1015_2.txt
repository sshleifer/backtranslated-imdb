Pathetic ... worse than a bad-made movie for TV. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason, Morgan Freeman speaks constantly and says "pussy" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman described the embarrassing "pussy" women ... What the hell was behind this thought? Many of the imaginable hole holes have made it along with the horrible camera angles, the confusing and lame scenario and the cheap background music that the movie is unbearable at all. <br /> <br /> I have rented this flipping with low expectations .... but. Well ... really sucked.
