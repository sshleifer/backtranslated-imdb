There is enough stars in the House of Spirits to create another galaxy, but the final product is highly debatable. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think most of them may agree with them. (Good liberal democracy, bad violent fascist regime, good opening up, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are beaten from head to toe with these, and are used as much precision as described by them. <br /> <br /> In the end, we have left to see the very noble people without any flaws accumulating with relatives who do not have good qualities. It radiates all the suspense in a poorly coordinated "pro" match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the shepherd, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as a talented bride and Glenn Claus, as her sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move, and it is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, Soul House simply deals with a large number of sub-schemes, and characters emerge from the image, such as the objectives of the photo gallery. We do not recognize them, and therefore do not take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and scriptwriter (from the book Isabel Allende), has extended the film or cut some characters, this film may be fully functional. As they are, they were a good try, with nice messages, yawnfest and yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
