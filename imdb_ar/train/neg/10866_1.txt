Let's see where we start ... misbehavior; I'm not sure if I'll call it that, since it's more read like text effortlessly. The actors in their parts do not seem to appear lifeless or unscrupulous. Surely there is a scene or scenes of nudity, but this could not save this film from its meaningless characters. <br /> <br /> To call a rapper's main character is an insult to the people who actually do. The words had no rhythm or flow and seemed more like senseless shits. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this film have a budget? They seem to have used less money than you saw in a YouTube video. Poor lighting, props, poor sound output. Bad special effects, if you want to go even further call it. It would have been a good story if people were really interested in making it, but there was no life for that. I do not care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I've seen some really bad clicks last year and that's definitely in the end. Do not waste your time or you will be wishing to listen to this unbiased review. Check labels, you'll see that the 1 quickly beat the 10 chips with nothing in between. I wish I had looked a bit closer before wasting my time. What a sucking festival!
