This movie was awesome! (Not as good as a Garret Longshot masterpiece) but still gorgeous! I thought Ashley looked so huge compared to Mary Kate in this film. I wonder why. Who would have thought they could swith places like this and almost get away with it was a kinda jerk dad though my mom was very little with Helmet Head. I gave it 4. Anyone who likes this movie shoudl check out Longshot.
