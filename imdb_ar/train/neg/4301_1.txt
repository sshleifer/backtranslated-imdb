I was staying one night and felt bored at about 2:00 am, so I slipped aimlessly through the channels and happened at H.B.O. Where this "classic" was playing. At first I was happy because I caught something at first, but my happiness faded for two minutes in the film. The whole film was about an unattractive man who had a fear of the female, and four beautiful women, but they were free of mind working as waitresses in his uncle's aunt, and his very fat and miserable cousin who also works at dinner. There are some strange transformations in this film that make it somewhat interesting, but definitely not worth watching. Basically, if you do not have something to do at night or you can not sleep, sleep medications work better. However, there is a lot of skin, so it might be good to see it without a sound, but even that might be annoying
