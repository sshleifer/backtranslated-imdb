Let's say you've been on a deserted island for the past ten years. We did not hear of screaming and left when we entered Halloween part 1 cinema. After that, this film was an explosion and a completely new vision in the horror scene. <br /> <br /> Currently, there is a 2.7 rating on IMDb and this low rating is not worth. Reducing the length of the road, such as "I know what I did," and who convinced me until the end, and why. <br /> <br /> Not a big surprise, a nice flick to watch with cola, popcorn and not wanting to get a tough plot, and deep characters. If your video rental is from the top titles, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I've seen much worse.
