Avoid issuing the United States. It is with additional American footage and the worst dubbing it has heard perhaps by New York fans. Dubbing is so bad that it looks like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black man from the Bronx performs a Chiba voice I could not watch the whole movie was so bad. Instead of this American version, watch other Chiba greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
