I can not believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Passenger this piece of rubbish was implicated! The script is very poorly written and the direction is very weak (both by the same person) making it harder to find more single-dimensional characters in the movie. The dialogues are so lame that this thrilling movie has become a laughingstock of the few fools who entered the theater. The setup is very difficult, inviting you to believe that you are going to see a chilling movie and suddenly turn into a stupid persecution film. Basinger's personality is so stupid that she has already stopped screaming at God "Where are you!" So that people can follow up, then take a leak! Then, apparently, I entered the smallest firewood in the world, I mean it runs everywhere, killers did not lose track, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, the best person who really writes in Hollywood can find that he spends millions on his production.
