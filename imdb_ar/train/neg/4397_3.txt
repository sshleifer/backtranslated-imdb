One of my sisters gave me this game, which is very difficult! It carries the appearance of a children's game, but you have to learn how to do a lot of complex movements that require you to turn and turn your hands to all kinds of embarrassing situations, and you must look for seemingly endless levels for your 100 improvement note! You must also find these impossiblely hidden puzzle pieces, which require you to perform almost impossible tasks to get! I am only on the third stage !! Maybe if you do not have any life you can stay at home all the time you might get some fun from this, but otherwise get away! It is definitely not recommended for children - they will pull their hair inside the hotel!
