This is the case with Columbia Pictures "Hate". The film's brutality began when a well-meaning American saw a Japanese made for a television movie "Ju-on" and inspired to reproduce the film in English. This hypothetical tsunami started from the bad decisions that swept around the world until the beach was flooded in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, I use a loose word, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a slim ghost Momma who looks like The intersection between Margaret Chu and Alanis Morissette, along with her noisy friend in the second row is the fat but the savage villain. Is there something panicky about an 8-year-old Japanese boy? Definitely there! Count chocolate comes to mind. With this eccentric group, we must add a mysterious black strip that you lovingly called Chim Chim. (Remember the speed of the rider?) As I had already guessed, they were killed in the wreckage and now they want to kill anyone entering the building. You see, as one Japanese detective explained, when someone dies in anger, his ghost seeks revenge on anyone who walks along the lines of property as determined by the district commissioner or something like that, I forget that. <br /> <br /> The story begins with enough innocence as the famous thief Bill Pullman jumps to his death from the balcony. I think Bill Pullman got this job because his children begged him on a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we bear the impressive saga represented by Yoko's nurse, "Do not go there" scream the audience, but unfortunately did not listen to the terrible warnings, is expected to be left like a magical lantern. After about 30 minutes on the film, we finally saw American hero Sarah Michelle Gillard as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gillard may be a competent representative, but I could not think of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that she was distracted. Which is equivalent to having Jennifer Aniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try what you can, you can not stop thinking about the other project that made it famous. But I went on, Karen, the nurse was appointed as an alternative to the original caregiver who disappeared at the ghosts. <br /> <br /> She wanders around her, meets the ghosts, dies the coma and talks some other things. Watching the fair-haired alopecia looking for threads, half expected her to find the ghost and pull her mask to reveal that it was actually an old man who owned an abandoned park! "You might have gotten rid of it too if it was not for you to interfere with the children and dog you!" <br /> <br /> Director Takeshi Shimizu, who competes to be Ed Wood in Asia, made two regrettable decisions that include sound. First, choose to use soundtracks only when someone is about to kill. This is an excellent position to obliterate any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another desperately unpredictable killing. Second, the ghosts gave a strange instinctive noise similar to gurgling gargoyles. After the film, I heard several people come out of the theater as they voted and laughed. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gillard ends up becoming the only survivor. Of course, we know that the fire that burned to burn the house has been extinguished in time for the next compulsory season. However, given the reaction of the comic public, they did not wish to complement, but apologize. The "indignation" can easily be re-edited into comedy, and perhaps then the value of the camp will be appreciated. Otherwise, this will be the biggest film since "Godzilla vs. Megalon". I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to the theater of your local cuts where it can get the public ridicule it deserves.
