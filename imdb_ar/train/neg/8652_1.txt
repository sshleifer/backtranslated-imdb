Before I started this film I thought it might be a good movie, but when I started it I found it really scary. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95 percent of the film was filmed in India. You can see Indian made cars. You can see Lars drinking bisleri (an Indian watermark), written on the Indian road, and you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * It's really funny and many other things prove that they did not shoot in Afghanistan. I think that no one should waste his time watching this movie .. a waste of time purely .. I recommend doing something else rather than watching this movie or the heart may be a better idea but do not see this waste of time
