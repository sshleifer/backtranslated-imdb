Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this crazy little movie that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. And her ... # 1 film in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks like Michael Jackson. Some Chinese lady who falls asleep within 3 minutes. Lame plot with dirty jokes. It's ugly and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham come out in 2005, I'll be very happy! (No) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play a loving role in an attempt to find the missing Green-Eggs and Ham. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and that means the man who escapes with them. (I hope they do not spoil the classic book). Do not waste time and money by seeing this.
