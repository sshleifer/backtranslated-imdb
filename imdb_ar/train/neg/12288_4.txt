Making the movie as dark and as visually obscure as possible to cover budget shortfalls is a strategy often used in low-budget horror films, but this film takes it far away. It's very bright and dazzling (almost entirely speaking at night, to take off) so you end up mostly looking at a black screen (although bad video transmission may have something to do with it). Unfortunately, "ambiguous" is also the best word to describe the film plot. The filmmakers cast a variety of (and non-original) horror ideas without any resemblance to logic, and halfway feel that they have abandoned efforts to produce a good horror film; you know this when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger (or, in some cases, even Dead) and she talks a bit ....
