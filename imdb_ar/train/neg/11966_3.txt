Bob Clampet is "Porky's Poor Fish" is a cartoon film with a horrible punk and a moment or nice moments. Porky's Poor Fish is located in Porky's Fish Shoppe and occupies an uncomfortable area between a black Porky N 'standard cartoon and one of the popular Merrie Melodies that appeared at the time. Many of the early inherited caricatures of Porky, Porky are usually away from the star, where only appears in a fairly open musical number and at the height of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a terrible cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity to have a free meal but gets more than he bargained for. Unfortunately, the public gets much less than they negotiated. As was sometimes the case in the series of books that come to life, highlight the signs of erosion that would have worked also in an immobile medium. Laugh, and although the caricatures are saved by the energetic Clampett trends, there is very little at all to recommend Porky's Poor Fish to any early Porky cartoon.
