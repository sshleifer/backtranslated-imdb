Absolutely funny movie. I live in London and the plot is bad looking. No one can be intimidated in the London Underground. In short time, do not work every night there are teams of maintenance workers there to check the tracks and make repairs, etc. The presence of homeless people living there is unlikely. Or that it is possible to secure your mobile phone and not reach it in this day and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst is likely to happen if someone finds there after another train they may get sprayed graffiti on them . Although this has become under control due to the sheer number of security cameras on the network, there is another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember in London as a whole that we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If I have been placed in a city, I'm not familiar with them maybe I could enjoy it through ignorance, but it is not a movie So I could not bring myself to suspend my non-ratification and try to enjoy it for a normal little story. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating exists! Probably the most disappointing movie of my life.
