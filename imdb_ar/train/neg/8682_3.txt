I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with much of what Bush did in his post. I love the Daily Show and the Kolber Report. They must be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the literary jokes in Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest man walking on earth (I think he is not the dumbest). But it came to a point when enough is enough and it is not really that funny anymore. I see where it can be funny and it (hey mockery of our power figure it's hilarious). Central comedy though she tries hard to make fun of him. I mean maybe one special episode, but the whole series is just stupid. CC seems to say only the same literary jokes that we often heard. I really can not see this show last 1 season.
