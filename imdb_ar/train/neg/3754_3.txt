As a longtime admirer in every Star Trek series, I found this episode disappointing, and I wonder whether the liberal use of "reminiscences" involving Will Riker's exploits, whether positive or largely romantic (and negative) is too much pain, and was The death of a fellow team member (a tool to save money, as well as many "bottle offers" (episodes in which all scenes occur on Enterprise). Diana Moldor (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserves a better final look for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. As the loyal viewers have been changed (in the world of Star Trek, is there any other kind?). This was the last episode of the second season. Thus, the season ended "not with a stir" but with "grumbling".
