I have noticed that most people who believe that this film talks about the truth are either not born before the moon landing (1969-1972), or are not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to wonder about a historic event if you do not live through it. <br /> <br /> I was young in Apollo time, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. Follow the whole world falling moon. Our families gathered around the television to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines reported the latest events - every day, from launch to landing, from walking to the moon - to the moon, to the beginning, in several languages. At school, some classes were canceled so we could watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and kept his collective breath as men embraced the house into uncertain fate. You can not go anywhere without asking someone else what it was. The world was really one society. <br /> <br /> Now with an insulator for 30 years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because the enthusiasm and attention around the world has faded. We have left with our history books, and anyone can claim that history is wrong and try to "prove" it with a set of lies and open facts, ignoring entirely the evidence that appears otherwise - not to mention the evidence inhabiting the souls and memories of those who have lived these wonderful days Fantastic and wonderful.
