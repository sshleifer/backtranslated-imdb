This mess is so bad it is not even described as horror. <br /> <br /> Deby Rushon's talent is completely lost in this film. It's not even a villain. The rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is very lame so I will not mention it. <br /> <br /> Do you prefer yourself and skip your balance in the end to hear the next band TwoMarlowe lead the song "Better Than" Sex "It's the 80th song of a full dessert disco .. Nice even the tempo of a song about gambling and sex ... More fun way of" Bleeding ". Put it this way, when the person has the equipment to copy the videos, but just decides to record the song at the end of the film, you really have the film "BAD".
