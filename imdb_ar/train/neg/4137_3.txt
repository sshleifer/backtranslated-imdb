I have a high level of tolerance with crap, so I was looking forward to it. I did not disappoint. She seems to be based on Carmella Sheridan Le Fano's classic, following the father and daughter as they hunt a female vampire, fortunately, she travels with her. Then we have Santa Claus (or Gen, as he likes to be called here) running on a random zombie. Have you mentioned there was a zombie outbreak? The dead return to life but no one seems too worried. We have Zombies construction worker, Zombies Soldier and even St.Trinian School Zombies. It seems that Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has turned into a vampire. Oh wait there are no vampires, the girl in a crazy asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I love zombies but I love lesbian sex in particular. Nothing like some simulation snakes to get the juices flowing. When will we see the vampires fighting the zombie? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmella a sexy or hot lesbian nurse? More of the cunnilingus, you can not have enough snakes. Here come St. Trinian Zombies. Time Chainsaw! More lesbian sex then kill zombies and eat vampires. I think the zombies won, or did they do? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have a vampire lesbian and a schoolgirl zombie? And the sneeze?
