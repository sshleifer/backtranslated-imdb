By 1976, the West was a bit of an exhaustion and the filmmakers knew it clearly. However, instead of attaching the project and saving us from having to watch it, they continued to progress and made it anyway. They seem to need an interesting thread to lure audiences to watch the movie, they decided to make it as violent and unpleasant as possible. I worked for The Wild Bunch so why not work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has taken advantage of a great script, but The Last Hard Men is old-fashioned nonsense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what Charlton Heston and James Coburn have drawn to the roles involved. He plays the role of a retired law-abiding man pursuing a group of convicts who have fled abroad (Coburn). The stalking becomes more personal when the daughter of Heston (Barbara Hershey) is abducted by convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a bloodthirsty film in fact, every time someone dies in the highest detail. It is very disappointing indeed, because pairing with the stars looks like a wonderful possibility. There is no sense of urgency or urgency in the film. It takes forever to get to work, but when the action finally occurs is fraught with stress. All in all, this may be the worst film Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the products I hate to include in his brilliant resume.
