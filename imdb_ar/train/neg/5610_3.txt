This documentary begins with an interesting hypothesis - it offers an interesting and compelling argument that the history of Jesus as usual may be a myth. Unfortunately, after we have been prepared for this film, the film changes the gears completely and becomes more than just a non-stop attack on Christianity and focuses heavily on easy targets. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some issues with the church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and it seems that this film is the form of his release. It will be interesting to see the first 20 minutes are expanded, but as a whole, the film disappointing.
