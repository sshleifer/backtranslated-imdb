Peeew this stinks! As everyone knows they are based on some insurance ads Geico; what no one knows why? Those commercials were amusing at first sighting at best; barely fodder for a chain. (Talk Geecko gecko - this is another story. Now this would make an interesting series!) And why did ABC - as reported in the press - agree to purchase the personal rights caves of Geico for this purpose? After all, the idea of ​​cave men who struggle in the modern world is not unique to television. Phil Hartman played a recurring role on Saturday night as The Unrozen Caveman Lawyer for more than a decade. This is how this concept works better - as a down payment. But a regular chain? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A series of sixties under the title "The Time" also included cave men in the modern world concept.) One exhibition manager, who was also responsible for Geico commercials, was recently quoted "We were very excited when we launched our commercials because we felt like we had something very unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Error. <br /> <br /> In the bad TV records, this place, together with the movie "Me and the Chimpanzees," is set to be in 1972 as one of the worst events ever. The main actor in embarrassing chimpanzees' failures actually went to a hideout after it was suddenly canceled. Our cave friends will surely follow suit.
