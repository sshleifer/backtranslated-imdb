It's hard to know where this adjustment starts wrong, because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has designed that you read them not for detective stories, but to see him very contradictory and completely false to Africa that does not exist. Botswana did what Porat did to Kazakhstan - not as successful, but in the same way. <br /> <br /> Once I realized this, I was stopped because Gil Scott, the American singer / actress, is cast as Mma Ramotswe. If she wants to represent a land that is not Africa, how appropriate is it to be a black woman and not an African? She is not the only American acting team; played Mma Makutsi by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are very distant, too old for the roles they play, and very bright. Both kill local dialects brutally, and both focus so completely on such brutality that they fail to offer much in the way they behave. Scott Mma Ramotswe Bouncy, cute and soft. The Mma Makutsi in Rose is an annoying whore with an engine. <br /> <br /> The result was almost inaccessible. The team of major representatives is replaced only by the presence of Lucian Masamati, who turns into a decent performance such as Mr. JLB Matekoni. Hess explodes smarter and more dense than books, but I find myself unable to blame my mumps for this - it's a bright light in the ocean of absorption. The inconsistencies between his performance and books were clearly laid out on the feet of any of the butchers' committee that wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, the writing of McCall Smith has always been very entertaining but notorious. He refuses to be freed. As a result, his books contain experiments in rules that limit scientific boundaries and characters that change the name in the middle of the sentence. So it's an achievement that the writing team in this project made it worse. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is now largely immersed. The characters speak of "openness" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni flirting openly. Mma Makutsi complains that she does not have a computer, but with her hair, makeup and jewelry constantly remodeled, she surprised me that she did not have a MacBook in her handbag with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> What did you leave here? It's hard to get mad at this crazy amendment because frankly, most of the things I like in the original books are fabricated anyway. McCool Smith paints a fictional Botswana inhabited by gentle people who do not threaten and are filled with the seeds of an amusing and palatable wisdom. It reads well in spite of linguistic grumbling, but it is a vision of how a certain kind of white person wants to be black. This is not entirely true. <br /> <br /> Because of this, it is hardly surprising that this presentation can accommodate what it is doing. It remains to be seen whether the European and American masses will notice.
