I wish I knew more about this movie when I hired it. I put it on my waiting list based on Heather Graham and her strong credibility as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the film were charming, many of the films felt contrived, undeveloped, boring, or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor for many people who think that their siblings were a couple ... I do not care about the size of much of the storyline, which I still feel a bit, or, overall. And Charlie, for the animal world, is certainly not very harmonious with the signals of other Homo sapiens. What did Gray make for her (along with her temperature and some common interests)? The story could have been more interesting with a little depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the references he sometimes found disturbing), a taxi driver in the clouds, and a dance sequence (if Sam & Gray were great dancers, I wish we could see more because the bits we showed were Better than most of the remaining films). Do you own the best.
