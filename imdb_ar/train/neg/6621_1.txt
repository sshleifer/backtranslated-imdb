There must be something wrong somewhere in the right place at a time when the director was aware of the plot. The film, which was supposed to be a remake of one of the most popular films in the cinema, failed to present it in every aspect of filmmaking. The best artists have not been able to pick up music, either, simply to show that the film itself was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> The modification is weak. Crap direction. Representation outside this world (OMG)! The characters that are supposed to look scary are forcing people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and fashion. <br /> <br /> I will not watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even paid me a free burger with it.
