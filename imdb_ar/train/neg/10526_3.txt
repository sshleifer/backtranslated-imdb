Girls dust the school reform, which plays fairly like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck there after her escape from her abusive father. Once she reaches the de facto prison, she is raped by her "female prisoners". <br /> <br /> Over a long period (even in the 98th minute), with a meaningless ending that makes the entire film seem meaningless. <br /> <br /> 15-year-old Linda Blair is doing her best to avoid showing her body when she wears her clothes, but she lets the nipple fall during the shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** *
