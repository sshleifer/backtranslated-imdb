A three-part "horror" movie with someone in a resident's home urges the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet with two psychics. It leads to two completely unpredictable fluctuations. Still, quickly (about 15 minutes), violent, well behaved and better. Predictable but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second concerns a man's escape after stealing a large sum of money. His car collapsed, a dog attacked him and stumbled in a nearby clinic. Very clear, poorly done and too slow. Even in 30 minutes, this is too long. Good behavior though. <br /> <br /> The third is hardly a horror story. It involves a beautiful single woman looking for Mr. Right. It has a beautiful designs range, a nice erotic feeling and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even frightening remotely. <br /> <br /> It's very stupid. <br /> <br /> All in all, the first is worth watching, but that's all. Adjust it one and turn it off.
