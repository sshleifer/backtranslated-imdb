This woman never stops talking throughout the film. I have memorized every line and delivered everything without a little natural passion. She also has an unattractive lightness, and her voice seems like fingernails on the blackboard. This movie contains a very large Wetsy Drake, and does not have enough of Carrie Grant, who carried little of the rest of the film alone.
