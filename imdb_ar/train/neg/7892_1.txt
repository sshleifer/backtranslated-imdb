I started with an interesting hypothesis. I always like the things of civil war and ancient secret societies. As the film progresses, the more you realize that the movie was the better. In the latter half, the film quickly became C, then D, then F, then "I wish this was not a rental so I could put it in the microwave!" I can not say that the behavior in all cases was terrible, much more. Writing, but ... I do not read the book. Maybe it is well written. The script was written by 10 years old. It was ridiculously shallow, the dialogue dim and uninteresting, and interesting figures like a bag of 5 pounds of fertilizer. I really hated this film, and so did my wife. I am a Christian and have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This film did not harm the case. Horrible, awful, worthless. If you like this, I highly recommend Superman 4.
