Calling this anything at all would be an insult to everything else. Some curses may describe it, but still very positively. One usually ignores this kind of garbage, but he was so stupid that one can only despair. It would be even though the Americans and commercial TV stations were supposed to miss this piece. But as the Germans say: Die Giggen Dammit Kimpfen Die Gautier Sylvester Firepans!
