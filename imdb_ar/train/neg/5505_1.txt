Shezbut, is this embarrassing. In fact, here's a list of 100 people that make up Awkwardness: 1.) A failed return to Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels plays the same role he played in the Direct 101 version of the Dalmatians who did not have much juice. He definitely has a funny way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney was what Jet Lee Bob Hoskins was to unleash. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Mars of the TV series, played a minor role (read "Embossing") in this click and died two years after Lupus. Coincidence? 6.) Terrible special effects. Seriously - awful. 7.- 100.) Speaking of Curse, Drumburn sued so loud to an annoying degree by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Oh wonder! ... one good. You - you're a clown. Well, let's conclude this review with a moment of silence for the painful death of this privilege, and if you wish, you can say a quick prayer that Disney does not forget this farce and do something ridiculous like modifying the movie "Mork and Mindy" starring Tim Allen ...... ............................................... .
