This mini-series is actually more entertaining than others with much larger budgets and greater aspirations. SOTD is somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it is not long (about 3 hours) I think the kids want it a bit. She got adventure, motion, "cliffhanger sights", not much romance or other "icky" stuff. When you are young, you are not very critical of bending rubber swords and acting in camps and scenes that are repeated. (At least two scenes are repeated in the film, just like in old soap operas to raise the audience.) Finally, children are usually more receptive to the Anglo-American dialogue that emerges from the mouths of Asians. (Not to mention the fact that many of the leading roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producers and actors deserved at least some extra credit to implement through the project. This film is not an art, but like painting your home, it took some time, effort and discipline to get it. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a recommended use of your time, but it may continue to delight children while traveling in the pickup truck. <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... Hey, IMDb! "Dialog" is the preferred and traditional spelling. It seems that your spell check believes that the "dialog box" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative model.
