I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I love running men. Obviously I was very excited because someone had made a film of it. When I introduced a local film network, I was in heaven. You're ready to spend an enjoyable night! <br /> <br /> The first indication of an error was that I noticed someone had thrown out Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply could not believe that the man who was famous for the hit movies "shooting" could play a more subtle role, as described in the book. I am still convinced that this will be a good film. Who knows, Arnold might have had some hidden talent? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I quickly discovered that the only reason he made it cast was that someone rewrote the entire story to make it revolve around the fightin game. Yes, it was a film Arnolda record: a mistake has occurred in the hero, solve the hero of the problems by reviewing his strong muscles and scare everyone away and the hero hits the girl. <br /> <br /> I was astounded. This is not what the book said at all. I know that books can not be put on screen literally, but this is not even linked to writing. Stephen King should have publicly condemned any affiliation to the film and should have banned the use of the title "The Running Man" for this shameful waste of the film. I do not say that often, but this movie was bad. If I was not at home watching, I would throw rotten tomatoes on the screen. Again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I have used "people" a lot.I have done so because I am sure that many people are ashamed to work on this and do not want to embarrass them more by naming them here)
