I was hoping this film would be famous at least. The plot was weak at the very least. I was expecting a lot of thinking in the cast (wondering if any of them would include that on their autobiography?). At least I did not pay for rent. Certainly the best part of the film is Danny Bohr, but the rest of the film is complete and rude.
