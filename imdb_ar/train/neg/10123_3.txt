I think that when Hitchcock scientists and experts find themselves together, the talk is not about brilliant master films such as "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train." It is a less known effort of 1931, mysterious and seriously flawed, The great director in a new format. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class couple in London scrambling to stay in the lead. Degrades a lot. She accepts it. The change comes in the form of a speech from his uncle, who says he will prepare them to enjoy the luxury of the world. They develop plans for a world cruise. But their problems have just begun. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger Thornhill, or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is angry right now, but you get the idea. Travel and Hitchcock travel together like moths and candles, each making a risky trip at best. This may be the first test for Hitchcock on this subject, not the most successful or memorable. Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case local drama rather than suspense, but the two do not knit, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The hills are a couple who are full of no chemistry or personality. When they find themselves in the Folies Berg√®re, in the form of intermittent clips that look ten years older than the rest of this film, they are hurt in the dress of artists. "The curtain went too early!" Emily gasps. "They do not wear clothes." <br /> <br /> When the hills drift off each other on a cruise in the ocean, there seems to be a mercy that kills more than a tragic thing, even if the people they share with are droplets, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) holds pictures of himself sitting next to empty chairs, proposed by Emily. Unique girl "Princess" (Betty Aman) has the eyes of Clara Pooh and the five Wallace shades. There is also a disgusting fellow passenger, Hosscock's Daisy hussy, always in the look of a caricature. Accuracy was still coming. <br /> <br /> Everything was shot in a sudden way, with confusing confusion and tense dialogue. Hitchcock tries to do some early comedy with a unique and unobtrusive umbrella, and Kendall seems to be aiming to laugh while Perry plays in search of tears. When Fred and Emily are separated, they are seen as wrestling in a pair of tiny cars tied together, one of many deadly attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely sympathetic personality, in part because she really cares about her husband and expresses concern about her relationship with Gordon, but mostly because she is among the many magnetic blondes of Hitchcock, and her platinum rings that glaze around her face Such as Botticelli on the open ship of a Chinese trash near the finale of the film. <br /> <br /> The issues conclude with a dangerous position as a set of pro-adversary elements to deal with, and presumably correct their relationship. They are just not active participants in the decision, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing is going on around the end. <br /> <br /> At least, you'll get a pleasant view of London in the early 1930s, an opportunity to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food. Rich and Strange pays Hitchcock his dues, and learns his trade, one for researchers and not for ordinary filmgoers.
