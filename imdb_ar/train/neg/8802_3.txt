See, I liked PROPER Anchorman, but that was really bad. The kind of bad that makes you wish you could recover that time in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think "what was on earth they were thinking of filming this in the first place", a kind of bad that makes you wish it had taken another 50 minutes When you enter the kitchen to grab a snack during the film, a bad type that makes leprosy look fun, a bad type that makes you think you wish to rent Pauly Shore instead ... seriously, I can not explain how bad that was. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there were some quasi-entertaining laughs, but they are all less funny than the Anchurman. Sure, they tried to make it amusing and fun, but the whole sub-chart that was left out of the anchroman that made it here was really excluded for good reason ... it was not good enough. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a service (or in the USA), do not watch this DVD ... he will hate the good movie that Anchorman represents and do not want to do so. <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm fine now.
