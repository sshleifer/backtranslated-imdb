Pathetic. This is what happens when a director comes to work just because someone pays him for it. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good and the locations and settings were great for a film with epic proportions. But performance, damn it! I swear, in some shots, you can see additions to the background staring at the camera, or look at the actors because no one has told them what to do when they hear "Action"! Battle scenes are very bad wondering - are these people real? They caused more damage just by embracing each other. In the slow scenes, you can see people on the battlefield walking or standing waving their hands. <br /> <br /> The procedure in the foreground is emphasized in one way or another. But for what? The story is illogical and heterogeneous, and it seems random cases in chronological order, sometimes it does not happen. The dialogs are stupid, and the plot is the most embarrassing and ridiculous love of motion movies in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> With a budget of $ 40 million, you can see every dollar invested on the screen, and in the best of scenarios, the end result of all this tremendous effort is the presence of a round, shiny laser disc in a thin cover on the shelf in the video store.
