Well, first, let me say I'm still amazed at how the plot gets sucked, but again, it's a Steven Seagal movie that just follows Stephen Segal! /> <br /> Low cost random scenes of the budget In fact I am still surprised, I have burned 90 minutes on this nonsense really !! <br /> <br /> Just renting a Jacky Chan movie or going to see wwf is more fun and not his and presumably not have and plan !!! Plz Plz Plz Avoid it! BTW The best actor playing there is Bill Goldberg and that says so much! <br /> <br /> Neither does he play well as I plz, avoid pfff I still cant believe I wasted 90 minutes and spent 10 more minutes writing this! :)
