The spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a unique cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here is the full story: a scientist receiving messages from space (Independence Day). Messages say things like a huge disaster are about to happen, and then the world will hear later on the radio that a massive earthquake has occurred in China. He begins to think that messages have to do with disasters all over the world, so he tries to figure out who receives the messages (and who also sends messages in space). He and his wife finally discovered that the letters were coming from a monastery. They visit. Everything seems natural, including the priest who plays me bored. But the world is determined and truly believes that the messages come from this monastery and go to it. So he and his wife secretly returned to the monastery where they were caught wandering around by foreigners, disguised as priests and nuns. They are being held against their will and the foreigners they play for me are forcing the world to get something they need to return to their planet. Once the alien gets on your element, all the aliens leave one by one to their original planet in a kind of attractive transport platform. Lee, being the last foreigner left, tells the couple that the land will be destroyed because of some kind of strange decision by foreigners. Lee walks in the carrier and has been gone. When looking at screens that show footage of natural disasters occurring around the world, the couple decided to follow the foreigners. Because the earth is doomed, the couple sees no point in staying behind until they walk in the carrier and disappear. The last shot of the film explodes on the surface of the pulp paper. End. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a dull film in my life. It's the most frustrating film I have ever experimented with. The world and his wife are the worst heroes or heroes who have appeared on the screen. They do not care about anything. They see Earth disasters on the screens and decide "What the heck, who needs the Earth anyway?" They are not even trying to stop them or do something to make things better. This type of story may have been successful if the film had a tremendous sense of death for everything except motion and atmosphere. The actors and people who stand behind this miserable denunciation go through their steps, so much so that you will almost feel as they poke their cards when they start and return to work. I did not expect much with this film because it was produced by Charles Band Band, but I did not expect this to be bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked about his worst film of all time and mentioned the invasions of Starship. Well, I'm sorry Chris but the STARSHIP invasions were actually fun. Star Warships are terrible but terribly entertaining. The end of the world is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH much worse: it goes beyond boring and inert, with no value for entertainment at all.
