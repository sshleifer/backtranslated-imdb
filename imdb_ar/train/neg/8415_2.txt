This was the longest of the Ten Commandments, each Lord of the Rings and the three combined matrix. Oh God, what a nightmare. This is the biggest excessive noise in 2006. This moment was not written or vulgar. The musical can be performed brilliantly and bring the real excitement of the viewer. Take Dreamgirls through Chinese Water Torture, in images of endless music, bad representation, and poor guidance options (Seriously, Mr. Condon, have you ever done Billboard footage of the old countdown? It's at # 58! Do not wait, look at the height Charts, here's a bitter Billboard notice to show you back .... and again .... and again)
