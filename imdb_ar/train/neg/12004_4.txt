"Salam Ishq" in three hours and twenty endless minutes, is a beautiful but superficial comic opera from India that tells us six intertwined stories of romantic love (which are at least four stories in my estimation). <br /> <br /> The film was filmed as a cross between a music video on MTV and the Super Bowl, and the film is a fascinating mix of exotic settings, dazzling colors, an exciting showgirl, high-end dance and dance songs, numbers, dreams and fantasy sequences, Stylized dialogue, and sitcoms - are all very standard when it comes to Bollywood events these days. It is an exhausting work that only tries to keep all the characters straight while dancing, dancing and going their way through an incomprehensible story. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to be enjoyed by the viewer. All the women who have died are dead - but he will need Ayoub's patience so he can reach him.
