I watched this movie at the Sneak Preview and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It is full of cock and dick jokes and is not proud of the sequence of events (such as a shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of the things I enjoyed in the film ... many of which I did not agree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Penis Dave Foley. 2. fart jokes. 3. Jokes from the bottom of the ship. 4. He was a dude dude. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again ridicules Bush .. We get him an idiot .. Continued. 8. Dude has blond hair. 9. Plot. 10. Kill minors 11. There was a bull in it. 12. Most of the cast were just assaults and there. <br /> <br /> Now (little) ones are good <br /> <br /> 1. The dude uses a muffler as in the game. 2. Lots of work. 3. Make the back crotch (and the mail maker's veil) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few moments "what ef" <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. Another crappy game was introduced into the film adaptation. Glory to you, Lord Paul. 10/02
