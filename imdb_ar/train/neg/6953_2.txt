Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series approaches, we have been well aware of it over the past six months as Sci-Fi continues to publish its offerings with BG ads, and I admit that I felt more comfortable because I learned more . <br /> <br /> As with any cinematic work that has stood up for some time, different people go to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, the chrome warriors with the red light swinging in their need. For others, the kindness they carried for special effects was very evolutionary for their time. Many people forget the state of special effects during the late 1970s, especially those that appear on television. For some memories solved around the story arc. Some still remember the relationships in which relations themselves helped overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I came from the last group. The essence of Star Wars Galactica was the people who gathered together to save each other from an evil empire. Yes evil. Cylons had nothing to gain except genocide, but they did. As the core stars spun around, men and women met to confront an enemy with almost unlimited resources, somehow managing to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they took care and trusted each other to get to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws and was sometimes happier, but they were people who cared about them. <br /> <br /> The book of this present delivery seems to have never understood this. In some respects, take the less important part of the original presentation, the names of the characters and take the story of arc and formulated what he called less than re-inventing the science fiction of television. Since that was their goal, they could be judged based on how successful they were: failure. It was far from replenishing. In fact, it was in many ways one of the most science fiction contests derived in a long time. They are borrowed freely from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth. I find it unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald Moore has been a leading science fiction contributor for more than a decade and has contributed to some of the most famous science fiction movies he can hope to see. One difficulty he seems to have encountered is that there can be no conflict in the Enterprise D & E crew. That was the undisputed rule at Roddenberry ST: TNG. Like many who lived under the rules of others who take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that power, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the well-known science fiction master, Jane Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best possible story, devise a mixed team as I saw it in order to create as much of the conflict as possible. Besides being dysfunctional, some of it was not as unbelievable. Anyone in the military knows that anyone who beats a high-ranking officer without any provocation will not only get a few days 'break-in', but could have been executed, and would not have left the next day. What was to happen, a period, especially in time of war. <br /> <br /> The thing that most of Ron Moore's previous work remembered was that he was the person who coined the death of Captain James Kirk. Captain Kirk was killed, and unfortunately Bistar Galactica was killed.
