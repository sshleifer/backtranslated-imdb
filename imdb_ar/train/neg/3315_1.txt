Bah. Another tiring rework of the copyrighted work that was never designed to be photographed. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Toni Collette is as wonderful as ever (being an actual actress, as you see), and there are some good handle hand-cut discounts. So that there are some genuinely funny lines, movies and the result and editing are competent, apart from the strange breakdown in the audio commentary and talking to the camera towards the end. <br /> <br /> But ah, but. Many representatives appear to be on autopilot, almost all of them very old (and in the case of young people) of their declared age. Worse still, they all speak Austenian, the self-satisfied song that can not be beyond the way people actually do on Austin Day (think of Yosemite Sam, I'm not good at you). This is especially sad, considering that in the end we see Vaxperan's demise as far away as Olivier and his colleagues were very fond of at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> Even worse, Gwyneth Paltrow is everything. She played only one character in her films, and remained real to form here, through her entire collection (from laugh to tampering) in the first ten minutes, then repeating herself for the rest of the long film. There is no chemistry at all with any of her admirers, and there is no obvious reason why they are interested. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no great reason to see Emma. It's adaptable enough, but if you're going to pack a movie full of synapses (for example, a very high shot that can not shoot the arc or handle the tone of the period), it might do it right, as with a much superior " ignorant".
