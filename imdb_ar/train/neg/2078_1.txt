I went to see this film yesterday and although I did not have much hope in this film, I'm still very disappointed! In fact I can not believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was bad !!! The story was shameful and the representation was terrible (although it had big names like Uma Thurman in it). This film was heavily based on his own influences ... but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished I had never seen him and warned everyone to watch this movie. It is a complete waste of money and will then be disappointed. My advice is to save your money, shopping, treat yourself, just do not go and watch this movie ... You will live on regret because it lol!
