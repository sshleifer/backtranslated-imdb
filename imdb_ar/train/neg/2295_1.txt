The boring boring film with Mercurio charismatic is completely lost. It was released for a minute on Thursday at one local cinema and may be avoided by all Sydney residents, except for four others. BACK OF BEYOND is a project that was apparently created by a product looking for fees. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve the best (Polson has turned out to be a director of lame thriller movies such as SWIMFAN, HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems to never get other thugs' roles. But Paul Mercurio should have been one of Australia's biggest exports on the screen. Roles like these are great disappointments and such films are just a waste of talent and time.
