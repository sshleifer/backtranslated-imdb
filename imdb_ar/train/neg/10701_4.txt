Crazy Merry in London is searching for treasure, where a young woman reforming her political father is accidentally married with a strong and independent lady who was never in love. An interesting early car for Katharine Hepburn, playing the role of Avelreks is similar to Amelia Earhart who was so involved in himself that he does not surrender himself to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the scriptwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted the book Gilbert Francau) are clearly assigned to this project to get women's point of view, but why are all old clich√©s intact like frozen artifacts? Billy Burke is the kind of lazy, slow wife who gets to bed when something goes wrong. Hepburn's latest scene is another. A strange artifact, but not a classic for Kate's monitors. ** from ****
