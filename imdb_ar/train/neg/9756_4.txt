Despite the title (in English), this seems to have nothing to do with the demons and much more with regard to a powerful hungry ruler seeking to acquire a phosphorus stone and wants gold made of lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays the role of Gilles de Lancre and seems to have no big problem executing people when they think they are threatening his status or when they need virgins for their blood. He is essentially obsessed with the love of his lady and a chemical scientist who works with him, and his problem seems more than greed and madness, which seems to be his problem more than his diabolical possession (unfortunately). There are at least some exciting parts like jousting and men trying to hit each other with big sticks, and the film at least gets a good view of it, but otherwise there is little to recommend. There's nothing he's afraid of at all, nothing at all, and the strangest thing about Molina / Naschy, not any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
