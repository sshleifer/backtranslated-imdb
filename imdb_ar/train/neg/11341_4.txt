This is the disaster that Fellini has been working for all his life. The line between a silly masterpiece and a free bond is very small, and the category on which the film is based often depends on personal feelings. However, Kazanova left me with great admiration for her collections and a little more can not be summed up by Bukowski: <br /> <br /> "Kazanova also died, only an old man with a long tongue cock and a lack of courage at all - to say that Life is good; to say that I can spit on his grave without feeling is real. Women usually go for the biggest deception they can find, and that's why the human race stands where it does today: we have assembled the smart and permanent Kazanovas, all of us hollow inside, We encourage them to our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As much as I can do, that's the attitude It is taken by Fellini with regard to his subject; granted, with more sympathy, but disgusted. <br /> <br /> The Casanova environment is made of decay and incest behavior, the Fellini subjects treat it more clearly in "Satyricon". Sequence plot is a feature of soft porn, just without cohesion. Donald Sutherland is ugly and slender to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, there may be a point in portraying Casanova as an ugly idiot. I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being clear; Fellini could not. It seems here more than ever before like a dirty old man - the maestro, certainly, but someone who satisfies his own impulses more than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine an audience enjoying this film. It was a story that did not deserve the novel.
