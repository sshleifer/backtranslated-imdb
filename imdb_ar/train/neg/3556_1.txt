You know you're in trouble when John Casavet works half-speed instead of the full choke of a movie, and "The Incubus" is a terrible scenario and the worst case of a big actor going through a bill-paying move. In fact, by observing the oblique script and John Hogg's approach to baroque art, one can hardly blame him. The film has to do with a series of rapes that occur in a small town, with much mixed supernatural rule. In some way, the direction runs to absorb the tension and attention of each scene, and the Cassavetes seem to look "Ed sometimes." The Incubus itself, which does not show until the last scene, is a good innovation, but not worth the wait. > 1/10
