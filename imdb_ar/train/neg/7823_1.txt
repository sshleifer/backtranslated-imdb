This movie was filmed very badly from every corner except the technique. She stood and watched as they came out of the theater, their faces drained like their life flickered in front of their eyes - eyes wandering around their neighbor, wondering if this was just them. I mean how can the film be really bad. No one admits it, it is a classic case of Emperor wearing no clothes. "Who am I to inquire about a movie that contains a man stopping a jet plane?" But the fact remains that every member of the public thinks as I write. I have already stolen their faces. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Lewis has only raised power, and will not get a cup of coffee with Superman With Glasses, which does not stop using jets. Can not be seen in his eyes "to the depths of his soul or anything like that.In old Supermans, she had some connections with him, he did not have priority number 1, obviously, but he reinforced her character as" torn. "I bet that Henry Kissinger He would have won this Lewis game before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> Now, Kryptonite has officially become Superman for what he does at the McDonald's restaurant. <br /> <br /> Superman "One" My father has lost his land , And then finds his true supernatural father, and the story captures every step on the road. It seems Superman returns Superman is associated only with Super People and seems to "do a job" only when he saves people. <br /> <br /> There is something about Clark that Lewis loves, she actually loves her internally but she can do it admits So, when it comes to the picture as Superman, it casts a strange love on the rocks.No Superman, she would fall in love with Clarke (at least that's what the film refers to, whether intended or not.) Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN , And Clark looks like a pile of horse maneuvers to Lewis. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I've seen it again. As a child, "I thought" I enjoyed this work, but I now know that it was the story that carried me too, watched it over and over again. If I saw Superman return as a child, I would have hated it too, I think. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of heart, soul and superpower going around this movie, it's sick. Superman relinquishes his powers for love, where a global conspiracy is taking place, and at the same time, Maanowells, Lex Luther got something great about his pack. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE. Now, there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, the only human to win, and Clark's inner nature outweighs Superman's power, because when his supernatural nature is supernatural (he does human things with his super powers), you see that she is not the superman you love , It's not a SUPERpoweredman force, but SUPERMORTALMAN she likes - which is really super. When she tells Clark that he "prefers" him to "Superman," he feels happy and has a human relationship again. He wants to be acceptable to him, not only for his ability to bend steel. This is the kind of thing that misses Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Clark sneezes loudly to help the baby to strike - humanity again. In addition, it is a powerful use of great powers. It does not use just brute force. <br /> <br /> He crushes the coal in diamonds for her wife because she had to sell her wages, and love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than saving. <br /> <br /> There seems to be nothing at stake in Superman's return. Even in Superman Three, we see damage caused by the scheme of global hegemony of the enemy .. see suffering, see how it affects Pryor and others and people in the middle .. There is no harm, esp. Emotional plot of Lex to sink the United States. We see a crystal ball thrown in space. Superman had to become very creative in the first three Superman to stop the plot against him, and was unable to "reach" his super powers. The first time, he had to stop two rockets in two different directions and then break his global mandate and erase the history to save Luis's life ... (That was thirty years ago!) "The second time, he had to beat three players that he was actually stronger than, With the genius of Lex, the immoral tactics of the villains, that overcoming Superman was not enough, he had to work against the other and overcome them ... In Superman III, once again, great powers were not enough to win .. I had to overcome a computer Calculates everything he sees, and could not use direct aggression on the computer because he calculated his provider , So he had to use only benign acid that became lethal on the computer after the computer reacted to aggression. He found this acid earlier when he could not simply use his super powers to blow up a fire because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his super fridge - he could not carry water , And I froze a lake and dropped it on the fire. Now in Superman back, the island is simply sweeping into outer space, like the nighttime temperature of UPS, he does not need to know anything, he is only using his "super power." Lex Luther's brilliance was demonstrated by the level of intent of an addict who had just run out of garbage. <br /> <br /> To say nothing about the fact that he threw that island into outer space after he was stabbed with a KNIFE of the right kyrptonite in the blood stream and the island itself was dripping the kryptonite germs in his face, but avoided his eyes and nose as if he had not It was Gray Bobon who was seen.
