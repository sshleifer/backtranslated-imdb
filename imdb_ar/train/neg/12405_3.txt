Shame it! There, you are comfortable with an armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, swollen in the hope of another wonderful night of entertainment in Muppet. What did you get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets move from Carol's high-end Christmas to this? The humor was appalling, the songs were worse than Country and West (and that's something to say) and the plot was confusing and poor like Blind Boy. I think the main problem is that they fail a lot in Trying Island. A short tale, like Carol's Christmas, is perfect because you can weave high moppets around it .... here the need to pull the plot along stops is all fun. Where do puppets go then? What about the Magician Muppets Oz?
