Although many people saw the first film, I was really impressed. This one is however. How to summarize it in a word?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it part by piece: here is the plot: finally, it was removed from its castle, but behind it: Snow white has problems of another kind: Court-Jester, her father's father, Super, Spliss, went to the extreme, to fight his gray hair and sell him royal offspring for some full blond hair. In her desperation, Snow White seeks help from Bobby (Otto and Keez), who must first find his six other dwarfs and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> It seems that the whole plot has been written on a weekend, where the book was very drunk but they were under intense pressure from the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for lovers of any other actor, it is not worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing, at least kind of save the film from total oblivion, is the performances of some actors. That's why I gave this step 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that no representatives or all of them can make up for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at some point, they even cross our reality, unfortunately .. they do not do anything funny while they are here. <br /> <br /> However, there are many great actors in this film: Otto Wallace, Ralph Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Kozma Shiva Hagen, (especially funny): Rudiger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many more Unfortunately, all these comedians are not able to rewrite this really bad text. <br /> <br /> This may be fun for some hardcore fans, but for ordinary filmgoers or even renters or buyers of DVD is not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret to rent a movie.
