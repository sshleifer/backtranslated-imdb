This is a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately it does not turn into a wonderful movie. What started as a sweet and eccentric romantic comedy about Fluffer's Love with Fluffee's Flirt is out of control to a strange mix of species and a real thread of intrigue, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA and LOUISE, and even a strange "dash" of 400 blow-offs Towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end, this good spot of production does not add anything. However, all the actors are doing a game with the material, and there are a few good laughs in the world behind the scenes of gay porn. <br /> <br />
