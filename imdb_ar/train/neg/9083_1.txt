It was very terrible. It was not fun to watch at all. Even the scene in which the girl uses the vibrator, so it is not interesting to see in this film. I say again, the scene in which the girl is listening with a rocking is not even fun to watch. Or maybe this was the only part of the movie I saw, just a girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have just launched one scene in the theaters, and maybe the film would be fun on a certain level. My advice, progress quickly to this point, watch it, return the movie, watch it again, repeat, repeat. Perhaps you can enjoy yourself for two hours this way. This film is rated as I spit on your grave and the generation is dying in the worst movies I have ever seen.
