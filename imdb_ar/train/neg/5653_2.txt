Let's put it this way. I actually get this movie. I get what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialog box was supposed to be Java and Emotional. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climatic and meaningless. This is what the writer / director was going to. Very Very Very Dry Humor / Comedy. With all this understanding, I still think that the film sucked. It seems that the writer / director was trying to recreate the dynamite Napolite with this film. He had all the same features. Even the main character acted like Napoleon. But the dynamite napolite was actually funny. Her script worked. This film is not. It has no goal. Well, let me rephrase what. Its sole purpose is to uproot the dynamite napolite and try to capture this appearance and appearance. Too bad did not work.
