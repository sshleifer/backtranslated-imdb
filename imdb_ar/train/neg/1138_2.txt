This was a complete disappointment. The acting was not bad, but the production was so bad that at times I felt I needed to stop it, but unfortunately I managed to do it and managed to finish a bit of the entire poor film. this is good. If you are good with cheesy moral conspiracies and do not mind watching a movie greatly offends Whitman. If you want a cheesy fictional story you go for it.
