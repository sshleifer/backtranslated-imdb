This movie was bad. Mismanagement, misdirection, bad writing. But they were not bad in a funny way. It was bad in a boring way. I watched the "surface to air" because I thought it might be laughable. Not so. Do not make a mistake. There are lots of fun ways to spend an hour and a half like watching dry paint or reading a dictionary. seriously.
