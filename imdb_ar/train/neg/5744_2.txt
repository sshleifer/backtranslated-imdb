This film was terrible, simply. It was very bad as I registered with IMDb to warn you of its risks. <br /> <br /> I am a horror film expert in the camp, in itself. I've seen "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many more. I know my schlock. I know that this film absorbs. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the movie consists of frightened individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not work, they emanate non-sequential lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When actors start to be accepted, the trend declines. There were a lot of low-angle shots; I figured that Lev Junker had a three-foot tripod. I've used what I call a "fiber maneuver" several million times: acting from an interesting object like an amateur. The crew seemed unable to wake up early enough to shoot the sunrise, so they shot the sunset ... and played it in the opposite direction. With this lazy trend, I was really impressed with the ultimate gory sight. The only thing you can tell is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) movie, rent a "Riki-Oh" or a "dead district". If you are a schlock enthusiast, looking for a challenge, give a "Darkness" step. <br /> <br /> Quote of the movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time to die!
