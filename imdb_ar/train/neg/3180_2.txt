What a boring film! To summarize everything, it was simply Nana Battikar beating his cousin Charisma Kapoor while she was trying to escape from the village with her son. Can someone say BORING ?? The concept was not so bad, but it was poorly implemented. Canadian areas were shot, and some of the village scenes. However, in total came a short cinematic. The story could have been great, but the film seemed to go on. There is a lot of stupidity that anyone can afford, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", which was only for five minutes. Otherwise, this film was a piece of crap.
