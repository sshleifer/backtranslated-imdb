I usually support independent art and I try to be inclusive and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> But this film is far from all understanding and tolerance limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the worst horror movie I have ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some wonderful and attractive ART for a DVD box for this movie ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. Voila! You have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> You can only watch it if you do not have anything else to do. Nothing better.
