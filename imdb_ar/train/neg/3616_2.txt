If you just look at the cover of this movie, that's great. DO NOT. The film itself made me sleep. It was a slow pace, minimal violence and misuse of suspense. The acting was a bottom feeder, while the plot was poorly portrayed in the film, while it was fantastic in a different film. They even kill the only beloved character in the whole movie! I give it 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the twist of the plot at the end. Otherwise, you may want to save yourself from the trash to this movie.
