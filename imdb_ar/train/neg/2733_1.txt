I discussed whether I should mark the spoiler box. Since 99% of this view may already have been viewed by any Scrubs follower, it is likely not to fall under the spoiler category. <br /> <br /> Shows clips. Grrr. We all knew that friends were heading down the tube when they began to offer clips ... Five and a half years later they went and fell into that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if the writers could not bother writing that week and told them, "Let's show other funny things." The command did not work. <br /> <br /> For starters, viewing all the times when people fall is not funny when they are out of context. It is not funny to see Todd hanging on a banana swing unless we know why he was hanging out with a banana swing. <br /> <br /> Secondly, since it was supposed to be a compilation of JD's delusions, another Turkish dream was not his imagination, although I forgot anything. <br /> <br /> This is the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things before. And collect clips of people dancing? why? This is not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit my favorite moments of scrubs have been shown in another compilation ... Cox realized that Ben had died ... and informed JD how proud he was. <br /> <br /> But even seeing those moments again did not save the episode. The summary explains everything. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, please do not let your program go the same way friends do, keep it fresh, or keep it funny ... or end it.
