Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should have laughed? There is no single tip or shadow idea. The three most prominent actors are parents, especially (I think Aldo) of Sicily, who can not make Sicilian dialect !!! Not to mention the dream-like insertion around Dracula ... just another way derived from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "movie" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do whatever they can, but this alleged film was extremely difficult to save. I would give it a "0" / 10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 so I had to over estimate it with one.
