With the exception of the best acting skills of both teams, this film is really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you will not really notice that production values ​​are cheap if you do not continue to try to convince you that they have production values ​​to start with. Even for the B-type weird film like me, this movie really sucks.
