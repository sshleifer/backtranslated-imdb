Wonderful! The stuff is terrible too. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor's showdown in Sardinia and coach Joseph Losey drops because of this surprisingly poor failure at Tennessee Williams. Taylor plays a rich widow who dies as she clings to her followers on an island where, in a very loud voice, she dictates her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When the villains appear Burton claims to be an old poet and friend, Taylor realizes that her time is over. Ironically in the end - it is difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are acting badly or whether Williams intends to make their characters unattractive. If that's the case, the representation is awesome! Burton mumbled his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screamed. It's really awful. As well as Noel Coward as a close associate of the "Thieves of Capri". <br /> <br /> BOOM is supposed to be about how long the flight is and how fast life moves --- two key themes from Williams, but incorrectly directed by Losey, which Taylor and Burton did not explain to the audience during their mysterious Mostly, any film material has been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has a stunning shooting --- the camera must be out of focus to raise the beauty of Sardinia! Supporting actors are Joanna Chimkos, the great Romolo Valley as a diligent Taylor patient and Michael Dunn as her dwarf security guard ... Both he and the dogs have a number on Burton!
