When I watch a film, I realize that it is "just a movie," but I would still like to allow myself to become as engaged as possible under these circumstances. I think this is what makes us cry, shout, laugh or respond in an emotional way as members of an audience, although deep down, we know it is "just a movie." What I do not want is for the film to remind me that it's just a film so I can not get into the festival, regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this movie chose to use the multi-angle camera shots repeatedly on the screen. It may be for me, but I find this distracting and irritating you. They may also occupy a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen, "Attention: This is just a movie. Do not allow yourself to become too interested or busy." If I want an image in an image, I will activate it from the TV remote control, but I do not want to enjoy it during the movie.
