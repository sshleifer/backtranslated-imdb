Sure, he had some good film making. The story is good, if it was a little nice and the acting was good enough even though I did not understand why Olivia Depot had a clear Australian accent if her character was supposed to have originated in the United States. My biggest problem was with the wardrobe. I know, as a general rule, that the average American is a great asset by any self-respecting European, but that was beyond that. Anna's color collections were positively awesome !! It made me feel like a potato bag to wear a coat all over the film, and I went out to the hives. I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers roam in Prada?) But simplicity does not mean the total lack of taste. A word for the wise ...
