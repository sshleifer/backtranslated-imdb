Now, it would be a bit of clich√© if I started with a little title, so I'll wait for that. First, this film made me wonder why children do stupid things like walking around in factories and breaking bottles. Then I realized, it's a movie with a message, and this message overcomes the children and things like this will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster grows and causes some chaos before it dies in a typical "kill the beast" manner. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has no blue in it nor any Simian of any kind. Now it seems like I have been deceived or anything. The picture on the cover had a bug / crap / idiot / giant on the front chasing some nurses screaming. It happened kinda but I wanted the monkeys! After you've just enjoyed the MIM EXTREME PRIMATE experience a few nights ago (half drunk on your cup and brandy mind for you), I was in a mood for monkey style more in the eighties. Not much if you like monkeys boarding the snow or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you love mistakes and good reasons to hit children, you can hire them.
