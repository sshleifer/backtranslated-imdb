Like many media experiences, this hobbyist effort has the seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the five years since its release, the hypothesis has become less irritating because of the real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for this reason, I imagine ... The director is obviously an admirer of Hitchcock, and it is very bad that the film was not implemented Better, but in fact, is almost a parody of the heart of fiction, including the soundtrack that screams when we are supposed to pay attention. One can almost see exclamation marks and large letters on a yellow page. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I found it amusing for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the spot has less to offer us, and I recommend it to anyone interested in dismantling it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the welds showed and they screamed a lot, my heart rate rose and I was reluctant to get up and relax.
