Why have I wasted my money on this last day of Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I refund $ 16? While I was watching this movie I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew even what it was supposed to be was to read the plot that was not like the movie. Why did the director enlarge the camera that is easy to use and then zoom out? It was not too professional. Why did Lulu show her nails for fifteen minutes? Why, when actors tried to speak, they seemed to read? Or is this the point? I felt that Phantom Love had no story at all, and to be honest, I felt my friends' vacation videos had a higher entertainment value than the movie.
