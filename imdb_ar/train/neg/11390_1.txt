This is not a movie. It is a collection of scenes that are not relevant, poorly illustrated and poorly assembled and that look like unedited results for a faint 10 year old with a mini DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the very rude girl in the train corridor - those with fat hair, a soft idiot, iPod and nerve pain - might have shot herself in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you have exceeded your ten minutes, do not bother to try to fit what you saw in the context of the mentality of the European artist recognized above. This is a real and complete waste of time, money and movies that would have made William Wenchott Bodin Kring. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless series of characters packaged in a vacuum represent what now represents a lot of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors shooting social intercourse at Wal-Mart's snack bar?
