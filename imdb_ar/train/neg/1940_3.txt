It was the writing of journalists and the eager, eager, eager and eager journalist who was crying, disappointed and smiling. <br /> <br /> I can not blame actors, but surely someone should say "Are you kidding and I cant say that!" <br /> <br /> This episode has a perspective for the press and a police perspective. While the police perspective was sufficiently standard, the press perspective was overstated and described, and sometimes it was unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I noticed that this was HBO's production, if so, perhaps the typical hammer hammer images could be explained in light of that, <br /> <br /> I was swinging completely during the press conference scene. It lacked credibility and was not remotely proven. After 40 minutes of the first episode I am still waiting for suspense. <br /> <br /> Skip Five Daysthis. The production of 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more interesting even if the crime is over. <br /> <br /> This story was unforgettable and can not be described as incredibly spectacular. <br /> <br /> For the press officer to start a press conference without the presence of an investigative officer to take press questions. <br /> <br /> It seemed so unreasonable that it seemed like an hour for amateurs. <br /> <br /> Then I began to look for reporters called Scoop and Perry White to show up. <br /> <br /> I saw Hunter Hunter 2009 before "five days" arrived in Australia and did not realize it was a prepaid package and I look to Bonville and McTeer to spin around again. <br /> <br /> A terrifyingly scary president.
