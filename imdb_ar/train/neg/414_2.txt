When you get into this movie, you know that this movie includes six laboratory technicians in a laboratory sealed with an unseen nightmare. So immediately you guess who will live and who will die. They end up being exactly what you expect them to be, so there are no points for the plot pages there. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure whether this is a B movie or a movie only in an interesting story lab, William Devan plays a role: the immediate B movie situation. <br /> <br /> The movie bodes well at first. In the laboratory, we identified the invisible gorillas that became increasingly violent. Woo, the prognostic. The best scene in the whole film is when the laboratory team makes Gorilla visible again. The special effects are great. The same thing when they make bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> For the excitement, there were no surprises really, except when Shue is made like MacGyver in the fridge, which is more than "Whaaaa?" Well, there is one surprise. Then Caine (bacon) returns back in the elevator column. It was a surprise but just because you scream at TV, 'Noooo! You're already dead! End the movie! When talking about screaming on TV, that's all I did during the last 25 minutes or so. "Put your glasses on f # @% ing!" Instead of putting on infrared goggles so they can see it, try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost it in the end. But the special effects were good. That's the only reason I give it 2/10.
