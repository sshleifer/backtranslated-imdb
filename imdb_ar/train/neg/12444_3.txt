Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in Space Girl Fashion. <br /> <br /> I love 50 science fiction, so I love cheesy science fiction 50s, but this movie is really very bad. Not in a MST3K kinda way. <br /> <br /> It is almost insurmountable with some buzos making a better impression of the "femur" than Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save the chefs of fi, as in "Cat Women On The Moon" but they can not. This movie requires mute and fast forward. <br /> <br /> However, I can watch Gloria and Dolores walking around the spacecraft for about an hour.
