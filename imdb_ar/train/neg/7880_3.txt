The Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of inclusiveness. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by the ignorant or those who rule with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately this film does not portray either of these. What we are showing is a propaganda piece with a lot of waving and finger. The animation and direction were well given the budget and timeline but the essence of George Orwell's novel is very missing. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how a novel is not adapted or just want to see the adaptation of this wonderful novel then by all means watch. I found this one to be fairly modest. The opinion of only one man. <br /> <br /> The new edition is top notch but not much.
