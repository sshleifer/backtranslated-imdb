Madi (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a turbulent past who gets more than she wishes when she goes to a party party with a handsome colleague. When his history and friends joke that they belong to the "killing club", Madi takes it seriously and moves directly to Level 3 by beating the brains of a woman in a garage (to paint her car!). But is Madi also a person wearing a plastic mask and killing other members of the group or has someone else lost it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poor, full of holes and spirals out of control just before the end of a ridiculous development outside the field. Some of the dialogue is frankly ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon, but the support team was terrible. However, I managed to sit through this full moon version at all. There is a lot of skin and blood which is the perfect type of flick to sit with a bunch of your comrades and chopping. Fans of horror can also enjoy pants from Brink Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as parents of Debbie) and Julie Strein (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
