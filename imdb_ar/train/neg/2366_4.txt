I am a fan of the Nightmare series but this is terrible. Very modern deaths. If you see this after 20 years, the nintendo scene is completely old. I did like the memories of the past. I think they should have just prepared when he was still alive. It could have been more interesting. This is a movie you can capture or leave. Depends on the amount of leisure you have.
