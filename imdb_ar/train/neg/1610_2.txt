What I found so curious about this film - I've seen a full 4-hour promotional version, is how strange it is. For a film about two highly attractive men - Castro and Chi, engaged in a huge political conflict, he is almost completely free of emotional fire. The viewer between Pencio del Toro and Demjan Becher (who is at best a second actor, a little loud) has no drama or depth and descends mainly to Castro to tell Che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation of the effect Or use this procedure that will result. Oder is still a representative in the team has the strength to play Castro - Joachim de Almeida, but he avoided him in the secondary part in the second half. Without the tension or emotion you expect to shoot at these men and their followers, the film becomes a short, epic film about men with bearded hair running in different jungles screaming and firing without a certain purpose or purpose. Many of the reviews I have read praise praise for director Steven Soderberg's work, with almost total disregard for actors. (In fact, he spent a lot longer talking about the new Soderbergh camera for digital film than plot or actors or the fact that it was full in Spanish with a translation into English.) This is something strange and strange to do since a) Soderbergh was just a rented gun in the movie and B) is nothing more than just an efficient job, with an unmistakable reference to Oliver Stone's JFK in black and white in camera work when he visits Chi New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'll get an idea of ​​the low efficiency of this film.
