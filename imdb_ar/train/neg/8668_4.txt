I have never read the Bradbury novel on which this film is based, but what I have gathered will be interesting (when I read it and finally). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and I was very excited, but when I finally finished, I was very disappointed. This is because the film itself felt very amateurish. The actors were not well represented (although both Robbers and Bryce are good actors - not here). Apparently, young actors were not asked to appear or wear characters' clothes or to define lines or make faces. The set and props were cheap and unreal. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised that I had to go online and check who he was directing, just to see what kind of work he did. The editing was cut and pasted and the plot (screenplay) was as well (although the author himself participated, ironically?). The accumulation of tension, fear and suspense was so moderate that it was not effective when it finally reached its climax. <br /> <br /> I have read some comments on this film and find it hard to believe that people like it. What hurts me most is that the content is exciting, fun and interesting. It had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the film was very bad technically, because it takes the shine of the story.
