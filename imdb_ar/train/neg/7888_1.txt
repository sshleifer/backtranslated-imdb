I did not know anything about the film or it was based on best sellers. Try guessing from the opening scenes what it will be, the best guess, the treasure buried and the death list. It lasted about 15 minutes when I got a sneaky suspicion that the film was crap. I will not show you how bad the plot and the acting, but anyone who has made more than two stars must work for filmmakers. the hospital. He was wearing his uniform, shirt and tie, and arrived in hospital in jeans and a shirt. You can not even get the correct continuity. I got the Christian theme, it's hard to miss him.
