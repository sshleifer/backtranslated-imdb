The Space Camp, which had unfortunate luck that was planned shortly before the Challenger accident, deserves this fortune. "Stars" mocking acting, Lea Thompson turns in a sideways direction, when asked for more than her usual innocent broad smile, presumably hiding her hard attempts. The movie is sometimes hilarious, when it starts to ask a lot of you. A young boy keeps a million-dollar robot in his wardrobe that explodes when a lot of orders are given by hordes of vulgar classmates. This vulgar and unpopular machine, Jinx, is a key player in the absurd introduction to the film, which appears to be part of the Short Circuit, part 2001 by Airplane. I can not bear you this, just say that you can not laugh unless you encounter it. After saying all this, it's fun to watch, in SeaQuest, saved by the Bell method. Romance technology, beware, incredible like each other. Also, if you're obsessed with the 1980s, it has nothing to do with entertaining performances by Kate Kapshaw (Willie of the Temple of Death), and obviously Leah Thompson. Also, Joaquin Phoenix places an impressive role as a kind of wishful thinking that Jinx endorses. Do not approach this movie if you are not a trash lover.
