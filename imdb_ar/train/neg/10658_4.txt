On our way back from the IMC6 (San Jose, CA), all five of us (consider three hardcore fanatics) came to our unanimous decision; the VV was a big folly and thanks to the film we were going to see on Monday. Not to mention that, we swore to stay away from theaters for next year. <br /> <br /> Kamal will not be blamed here for giving a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like, "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri script, Directed, Acting'la innum namba munnerala" (Tamil Cinema grew in terms of photography and editing, but we barely improved, when it comes to script and output And representation. ") While watching VV, these words look very real. <br /> <br /> Now, here are the ten reasons you hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I can hardly keep myself from using an obscene word here, but the truth is that HJ has mastered great craftsmanship in every last film (remember "Anian", "Ghajini" ") With his angry cacophony, bills as music in the background. The next time he performed the eardrum transplant, he paid for it. 4. The songs do not help the songs move the movie novel from one place to another / temporarily, as it does not make you sit and take notes, the movie looks Like a made of four long songs with a few n scenes in between. <br /> <br /> 5. The short VV is very far away .VV at best is suitable to be a short story, not 2 hours in addition to "excitement". To use cliches here, like an Energizer bunny, go on and on. Only in this case you do not want it. The last part of the movie looks like a big drag. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika The pairing can result in two ice cubes separating some of the sparks from this lead coupling. There is no reason for you to take root to make it together. In fact every time they meet in the second half of the film, they are a good nuisance to the narrative. I hate to say this, but the 10-minute Kamalini Mukherjee's story is more than what Kamal and Jocica do in this film as well as "Theinali." <br /> <br /> Kamal Kemal Kamal's tone has this buzz tone that no one speaks either in India or in the United States. And it's not new either. He has been doing this since "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". It simply gets the nerve. Imagine what ruin can do when you meet his taste by using this exotic dialect on the site in the United States. He does not leave it in the circle of migration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (puzzled TN Cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in chaste Kamanglish ("Wha we have here wok plain bad police"), of course with the effect of nausea. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are a few managers who expect to stand in a certain range. Gautam failed us badly with some crappy performance in the management of common sense. Who will face DC in his desire to love on the streets to discuss things like committing himself and life after him! The scene inside the theater was so bad, towards the top; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's intelligence. "Is he stupid, can not he just use sirens or lights?" (In the crowded Madras road, Kamal the policeman chases the police man on a bicycle like any ordinary friend!). "Can not just use his weapon?" ("The Man on the Bike" starts on foot and our full-equipped Kamal is in a hot pursuit for a long time). I do not vote for the latter, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and violence: If you want to see raped women, the faucets are cut off, and more women are raped and slaughtered in the bush with harsh authenticity. I was sitting at home watching the police report or the "tram". The use of excessive violence must proceed in a way that expands the story, not overwhelms it! Somewhere down the line, Guttum is confused about what extensions (rape and murder) and what is the mainstay (story)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot Espresso could not get the pain out of the head.
