This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the scheme outline. This film is painfully slow and I feel bored for about 98 minutes. While representation is weak at best, the biggest problem is the scenario, which is poorly written, slow and rising without a real direction. Sometimes a strange mood is set only to be broken through a useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the whole crew was sick and throwing between the shots, they did after all trying to digest a terrible scenario. As a great fan of good horror movies, I'm always worried about something bad happening. Save yourself 98 minutes will not return.
