I loved my 7-year-old daughter, as Disney's calculations were judiciously calculated. This is the problem with Air Friends. It is a film of children with extreme precision filled with carefully calculated gravity, politically correct morals, and potty humor enough to avoid the dreaded G classification. As a parent, or even when you are ten years old, you've seen it all before and have done better than before. Think of the "101 Dalmatians Meet Alone" and you will get the general idea. I think the story of good children is a good story. Air Friends, which are as original as recycled paper, failed to meet this standard. It's not the worst video your child can see, but there are millions of best videos.
