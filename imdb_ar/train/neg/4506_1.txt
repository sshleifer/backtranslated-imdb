US film makers decided to produce a film they think is Japanese. The characters are all badly represented, the actors are not Japanese and the group is cheap and unrealistic and certainly does not represent Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Whoever read the book ever understood that the script writers did not add any additional value to the distinction between film and text. Worse still, they even changed the original plot line with some idiot. Rob Marshall uses two main characters of two well-known Chinese actors who have joined in the Dragon Crouching Hidden Tiger. Marshall may have seen a single Chinese film and represents Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again makes movies more ridiculous. The last scene of Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is more than ten times that of the Japanese film.
