Belmondo is a tough cop. He is pursuing a big drug dealer (played by Henri Silva, a great evil habit - see "Sharky's Machine"; but here he is called a clear name, and because of that he lacks the usual charisma). He goes to the most interesting places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, beats some people, gets names, goes to more pampered places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. After punch. The people they made seemed to have no ambition but to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 years old, performs some good stunts at first; apart from these, "Le Marginal" is a violent, smiling, stocky, shallow and forgotten cop. (* 1/2)
