I have rented this movie because I hope it will be one that everyone will enjoy. Although the film is a family friend, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow him, you are not content to succeed. Your football team will not always win. You will not get better grades magically. Infertility is not always treated. You will not always get an increase. Sometimes, you will be stuck in the old car. <br /> <br /> There is no God to meet all our whims. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify him more when things look bad for us. To live is Christ; to die is profit.
