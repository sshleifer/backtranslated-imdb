After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews that I compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read it I could immediately see the reviewers point. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt on a similar theme. Interestingly, the film format is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. Ten elements rush to the viewer through a one-day timeline of the film, while the better-planned "Lost In ..." seems to be running for days. <br /> <br /> Sure some people will see this because it contains Morgan Freeman, and I will be disappointed. His best roles now appear to be supporting roles in big films rather than a major role in limited-edition films worth $ 10 million and independent films.
