I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a bad-made movie with very few laughs. <br /> <br /> Politics has begun to appear, it will offend the hell of Republicans, but this is what it is designed to do. This alone gives me a chuckle. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it seems to have been in a real hurry (like about a week). It contains a stupid sub-plan about some Bembo singer, and it seems quite off topic. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Turkey is Iraq, Afghanistan or any other number of states that the United States has dealt with since then. The 1950s. The humor is a bit dark (smiling beginners with Tamerlane artificial legs), but it is at stake, especially with companies that benefit from reconstruction ("Light Democracy"). <br /> <br /> Much of the spelling criticizes the United States, It seems terribly heavy and light. I think it runs counter to a lot of publicity, so people must beat above the head to express their point of view. Who do you know? I prefer more than push approach, wink - a bit of precision. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, maybe I'll see him again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more than that.
