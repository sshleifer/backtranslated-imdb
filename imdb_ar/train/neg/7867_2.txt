Well, I've tried and been tried, but I still get this guy the debtor. Tales from Gimli Hospital left me cold, this film about the Austrian villagers and the film about Ice Nymph is beautiful but it seems not to be in the story section ... This nude film about abortion and hockey has become boring. I am happy because Maddin is rated as a silent film, but I do not like his films for the same reason I like Quentin Tarantino films: it is an empty tribute to better and more creative films - films that have enhanced the art form or broken new ground - all style and not material. There is no amount of quick cuts and alien camera angles that can mask the fact that Maddin is the non-original David Lynch wannabe, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write awkward dialogue, because most of his films are based on titles. The bottom line is that Maddin's schtick is a smart, intelligent film industry for ambitious film disciplines.
