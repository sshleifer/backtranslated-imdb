I just add, if anyone reads this already and has not got this point yet. These other reviewers do not joke, it's actually the worst color film you're likely to ever see. When the film started, I could not believe anything like that the world had seen. <br /> <br /> They do not say that only when they say it looks like a home movie. really no. Like the "director" taking a family hi8 camera (before DV cameras and non-linear editing of the computer), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.), some students took nice actors, went out to shoot a movie. There is no scenario, just set it up as it goes. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, it was on a mono TV, so I only have one audio channel (left of the right speaker). At first I thought I was wrong. The film was silent until someone spoke for two minutes. I woke up and moved to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but could not hear the dialog box anymore. Record the sound on different blood channels! I mean, there are movies that can be seen in a funny way, they are very bad, they are kind of things. I'm not sure that this is one of these. I mean, I'll admit I'm a little emerging filmmaker. Watching bad movies makes you want to go there and prove you can do it better, you know. But watching it made me feel sorry for anyone who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as it was, representatives are the only good thing in this regard. I thought the chick was hot, disappointed in the palace of her bathroom scene. A little bit of T and A would have lifted the score from none to maybe 3 or 4. But unfortunately, no. If you want to make a movie but it turns into nonsense, throw some nudity without justification. Roger Kurman worked.
