This is my first time watching a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last. She failed to find out why he was funny, although people in the audience thought he was very fun when he turned his face to the camera or said "I'll be bathed." <br /> <br /> The plot is quite predictable. The bad man comes after the good man. The good man has a woman, so the bad man uses them. In between, officials fooled. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. You spend two years and millions of dollars chasing a man, but are not you doing your homework to solve a trivial puzzle? <br /> <br /> There is no wonderful representation, there is not much plot or story, and MTV-style shooting is done. Do not waste your money on this one. <br /> <br />
