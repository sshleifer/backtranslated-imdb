Words can not really describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least there were some nice, good mental shots that were swinging here and there to prevent you from nodding. This is just laughable! Terrible scenario, bad direction, terrible representation and you know what? I can not think of one thing to recommend it other than the fact that it is not long. If you want entertainment worth 100 minutes, book a dentist and get some root canal business - much more fun and better value for money (assuming you need it!). By the way, I need to write 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. It's awesome!
