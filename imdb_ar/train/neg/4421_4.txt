This theme is certainly convincing: a group of people take their love to play one step forward by creating a fake world of medieval times full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that deepens our collective need to "escape" from reality and sometimes to some extent our existence - something almost anyone can relate to. The characters are a predictable combination of the maniacs of Lord of the Rings and Star Trek fans. This is enough to make most people to watch. However, very quickly the film turns into an inward-looking view of the war games while relaxing the stereotypical nose of viewers who "do not get it." It seems that filmmakers are taking up the subject of war games, and this in particular is taking more seriously than once when they are aware of the humor and fun of making a film about adults dressed in medieval clothes and beating each other with foamy swords. It's very hard for anyone not to sit on their computers for 7-10 hours a day playing games or designing the latest devastating star to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should care about it. However, it seems that filmmakers themselves are not interested in choosing to focus only on the theme of the game itself rather than building a strong story with a clear story that anyone can understand. Moreover, the characters themselves are not so urgent and soon bored of them: not too big when trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
