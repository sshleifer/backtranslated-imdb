May contain spoilers ... but even though it can actually be corrupted !. <br /> <br /> Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... amateur. This film tries to be different from most movies by the kind of movie "Blair Witch" .... it does not work .... it ends up in the form and feeling that someone has a cheap video camera, a pickup truck and decided to make a movie. There is no explanation for the story, and the hero is not given any real incentive (and looks like a lesbian wearing a suit of strength compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... Only the sounds of shouting and depression. The whole movie happens inside a car which means that the decent scene is out of the question. The five girls do their best with what they have done, but in general they encounter them as very terrible actors ... although it is hard to judge the material if they can actually .... they are spending WHOLE screaming, yelling and crying. A lot of the time, it is hard to know what was said and the cameras are very bad and it is actually difficult to know who said so. This video depicts itself as a violent film of torture, but in fact only five girls in a car screaming in horror ... literally sums up the entire film ..... then we come to the end after what seems like 5 hours of continuous screaming and all five girls are still on Alive ... with one finger minus a finger. The only thumb (get it ... LOL) is for the poor actors who tried hard and lost their voices (and pride) after they made this terrible film. Do not judge this by the poster .... you have to let go.
