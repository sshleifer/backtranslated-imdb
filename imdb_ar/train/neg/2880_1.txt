I did not watch a film in a very short time. The only salvation was the quick-forward function on the DVD unit. It was like watching a bad-cop. Obviously there was no money for lighting, photography, collections, location, screenwriter, editors and actors ... Oh, there was not any story at all! I need to write ten lines of comments ... bad, awful, awful, miserable, painful, twisted, nausea, disgusting, pain, disgusting, flimsy, Ike, yuki, yuki, pukey, stink, smelly, Something - a thumb down, I do not know if I can continue to complete all ten lines to how poorly produce a piece of this kind of foolish!
