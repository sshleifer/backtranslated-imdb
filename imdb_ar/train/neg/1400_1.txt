Oh, my God ... I thought the early CBS television programs were the worst things Gerald MacKarney showed in ... <br /> <br /> Four people were tested by insane mental control. <br /> <br /> . That's it, you do not hire it. <br /> <br /> I've seen this under one of his many titles - Gray Matter, which is perhaps one of the worst movies of modern memory. Other Reviews <br /> <br /> True, it's too bad. There have never been a lot of stills. <br /> <br /> Never appeared on the screen, never. The cast is awful, the direction is awful <br /> <br /> and the scenario is awful. I can not confirm how awful it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as do smallpox. <br /> <br /> This PG is classified as physical violence, some light weapons violence, gore, some obscene words, and some adult attitudes
