(R # 97) <br /> <br /> There's one good thing about Pokemon this poor guy (make what you want): the opening theme. Must be the coolest music of any Japanese television program dubbed specially designed for consumers Oops. Unfortunately, there was a need to add a type of display after the opening theme. They could not come up with anything more interesting than people who loudly defend their cards better than others' cards. Freud's day was a field day, and unfortunately I can not imagine why any children would want to sit in a show. A thousand monkeys' talk in five minutes would take 98% of the run time. <br /> <br /> "Uber-Fantastical Doomsday of Your Ultimate Animal will take the pony pyramid in one fell swoop! Can not you see that you do not have a chance to win this battle, are you fooling? <br /> /> "Oh, well, watch this! I'm about to use my Delta Force Delta Force dumplings card that destroys every one of your Munchers and make your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Builder from Ultimate Doom Destroy Beyond All Signal I bet you did not see anyone coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they're doing in this show. While in another show of the critical children I used to watch, the Pok√©mon commercial phenomenon (every mum pet), the monsters at least had the grace to throw it once every time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" only, in quiet words from Roger Ebert's Orange Orange Review , "Plain and boring". Not to mention a long period of wind (I realized I was hypocritical here considering the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show lasts forever. I do not know if there is any conspiracy, not for fixed monsters anyone of Pokemon attributes. Even if you do not compare it to my favorite cartoon as a child, this offer sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Good-bye, narrow sleep, the dream of wet dreams.
