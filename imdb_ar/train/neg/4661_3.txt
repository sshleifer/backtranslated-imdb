This film features Richard Pryor, Russie Greer and others. It's a curious WW2 movie, a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand the fact that the films reflect what we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time that you envision. This means that film 70 is not a movie 40 (WW2). Still, there are some good motion scenes of seven black men led by a white commander trying to grab the dam. The story is about the captain and she knows that these guys are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that can be from a civil war film and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the film is about. Lt Black gives the German women innocent Beck on the cheek, the white captain becomes upset. I enjoyed the film from a curious point of view because the stars were interesting to me.
