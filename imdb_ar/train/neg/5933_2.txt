I've been a fan since his first album. This film is his harm. The offers, with one exception of Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply awesome. <br /> <br /> Martha Winright, Nick Kayev, Anthony and Jarvis Coker were particularly upsetting. Even one of McGrill's sisters was destroyed by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I have never seen my wife wake up and walk out of the room on a movie before and quickly found myself redirecting through the shows to reach the few interview clips, which were also difficult to see because of poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many who have been able to interpret the songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Warns, Kee DeLange, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but the people chosen for this show come to mind. shocking. <br /> <br /> We hope there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in the film that shows his vision, talent and intelligence. Very sad
