Cut tries to be like most of the post-Scream smugglers who tried to be, a parody of the kind of horror that tried to be clever by reference to other famous horror movies. Now, I do not wear "Cry", I think "Cry" is a very good horror film doing a great job in blending horror and comedy. Cut failure on most levels. It includes moments, but generally does not work well, not even a "very good" sponsor, and just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so is fine and the story set is fairly good, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act, ironically it's her tongue out, the shape goes. Some time and a group of film students want to finish her film, which seems to be cursed. As I have probably expected, the masked actors are slowly being pulled one after the other by a suitable madman. <br /> <br /> The plot is original, misrepresentation and a predictable end are some of the following elements. There are a lot of references in the film, everything from "Scream" to "Texas Chain Massacre". This is not smart, either. It seems as though the director wanted to feel intelligent and calm by referring to other famous horror clicks: Scream. For the shrubs, there is a minimum heir or nudity, which is a big negative when it comes to the brash does not bear much. Really, I must support this film because I am an Australian and we are not good when it comes to horror (we have our gemstones), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, I've kept watching for 90 minutes or so, so this is at least a good thing. I do not recommend this to anyone, regardless of fanatics who are hard-core, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to achieve, but if you're looking for a good movie, go away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
