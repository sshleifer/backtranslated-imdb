If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you pick up a copy of the original Algernon Blackwell story. This was not only a bad film, but it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a kid (in "Campfire Chillers" by Im Freeman) and was very excited to see a movie based on that coming out. I was very disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there was a lot of personal computers (politically corrected) throughout the film which had no place in the film. When the book was written, the computer was not present. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not to waste your time or money !! If you see it on the video store shelf leave it there.
