Although Frank LÃ¼sser's songs are some of Broadway's best songs, Joseph L. Mankowitz's music has deteriorated intermittently and an uninspired presentation - when it ended, I barely felt like watching a musician. Munkowitz does not seem to know how to make the most challenging but challenging strings: for example, one of the best numbers, concludes the Adelaide's Lament, with the Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) strap finally shown while sitting at Chase Hall and Stubby Kaye 'Spiritual' Sit, You Rockin 'The Boat' has a chorus of his support sitting on folding chairs while standing there. Mankovitch moves away from everything by allowing the static viewer to go on for a very long time, and his dialogue (adapted from Abu Burroughs' theater book) does not have the intelligence of his films like "All About Eve." Part of the blame must go to potential clients, all of whom are abused: Marlon Brando seems puzzled by why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays in a very nice way and has no edge which makes him very necessary (the songs are not designed according to his style) Simmons hardly records the way in which Shirley Jones can. Only Blaine, as a beautiful Adelaide fashion girl, is as interested as a Broadway professional. The colorful artistic direction by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created delightful collections.
