There is a lot of good to be said about this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich and rich in colors and full of elaborate Art Deco details. The animations correspond to the usual studio standards of the time, which are undoubtedly higher than those at present. However, I find them strenuous for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: Definitely does not live up to the usual standards of Scott Bradley. Although it is supposed to be exciting for Gatsby the Great, it ends with depression, drowsiness, repetition and monotony (not the repetitions and monotony is the same, as Beethoven attests to the Fifth Symphony). Since most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes when yawning, there is much of the visible part of the animation that the ordinary viewer will miss. <br /> <br /> Story: I'm not giving up any secrets that are not already in the plot summary - a good country, a bad city. This is a common theme in films, whether live or live, of this age. It is a misplaced nostalgia for a non-existent rural plague, which is reflected nowadays in nostalgia similar to "values" that never existed.
