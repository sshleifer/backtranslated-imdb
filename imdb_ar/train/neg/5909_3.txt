The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Myers then proved that he had one good idea for the rest of the film. The absolute lower jaw is the common denominator. Painful presentation. Full routine work. No doubt written in less than a week, just like the first. Myers gave the hook and locked it in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. Do not let him go out until he develops a text that is fit for something or anything. He has in it. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Allow Goldmember to sink without any trace.
