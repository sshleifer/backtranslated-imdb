Yes, that sums up it. This film was terrifying. I wanted two minutes to take my eyes off. This has been hailed as an "innovative LDS comedy," but it is not good for the members of that church! I do not think any human being should be a victim to watch a movie of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that no effort has been made at all in this movie. It seems as if the terrible and stunning plot was thrown together by two of her crazy sons, somehow saturated with the idea of ​​a coherent gift (at least semi-coherent). Then, there is representation, which is bleak of everyone * concerned. Even sediments fail to bring vitality to anything. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the fact that our hero is a shallow jerk would like to believe it can change, but this road is filled with awkwardly embarrassing dialogue, horribly "hideous gags" and a lot of mormons "in the jokes" that anyone In their right mind, LDS or not, you must consider * purely * stupid! This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
