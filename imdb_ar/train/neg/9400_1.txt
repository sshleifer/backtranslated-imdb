It is very unfortunate when a film is made like this. I've been putting a lot of work and money into an amateur movie at best. <br /> <br /> The editing process continues, and there are obvious errors that can be easily corrected in a second experiment, and the soundtrack is non-fiction. Much can be done with this video. I think it ran out of time, or a video. <br /> <br /> The mobile shots feature a distinctive amateur look.
