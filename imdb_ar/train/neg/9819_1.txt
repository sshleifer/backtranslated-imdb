I've read the other comment about this film, and I usually try not to be harsh in my criticism because I'm trying to be a nice person. However, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen (and this is topped by a lot of USA USA bad movies and Cinemax nights.) Anyone who has thought about this movie needs to be prevented from making another film at all. This film angered me in a way that has no other film at all. I really think these people are crazy. Just save your time and do not see this fllm. Please - I wish I had. Representation is terrible, plot (what plot) are stupid, degrading and crazy. I really do not think this should have been in a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.
