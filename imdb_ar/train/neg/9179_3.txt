It is cheese. If all you want is a video game, complete with what looks like direct sequences from your computer to work, the movie was so cheap that it actually makes special effects, that's all. My friend and I spent a good time seeing him, because the theater was often empty and we could move a little. This film really requires a check. <br /> <br /> A conspiracy? Was there a conspiracy? Well, some stupid colleges or later species are invited to the "delirium of the year" and go to a San Juan island ("If they stay back in Seattle only, they will have survived."). They arrived there and everyone went, and the location was fairly broken (but hey, the barrel was still full!). With the help of a tough old captain and a Coast Guard woman (who behaved a little less - and slightly less than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight a lot of zombies (some spit with acids) and get a number of horrific myths, most of them killed. It was not. <br /> <br /> It's not as good as a BAD like Demonicus, but not much, and still better than Severed (it's kind of Alpha and my personal omega for bad movies - bad first but fun for heckle, the latter is just too bad To see more than once). On the other hand, if you expect an excellent video game like Resident Evil, run away !!! Run away now !!! <br /> <br /> Well, some real big questions (without a lot of spoilers): Ever since when the Spanish ships invaded the 18th century in the Northwest Pacific ????? Why does anyone in the Northwest Pacific smuggle guns, and to whom - Canada, to shout out loud ?? Why is the rave on an unknown (oh, excuse me, it is called "Isla de Muerto", Xia, to the right) San Juan Island - and outdoors, taking into account this is the North Pacific. And the presence of rave about 30 people - "delirium of the year," my Lord. <br /> <br /> Fortunately there are a lot of grudges. A lot of them. Everyone has them. Hatchit must be selling soon. <br /> <br /> Finally, as the film begins to play with a small "spoof" (with batches in I Know What You and Jaws) close enough. <br /> <br /> Well, finally - when the introductory comments (with more or less voice) mention that one of the characters "let her boyfriend focus on her fence" you can be sure that there will be some fencing at the end of the film. Not a good fence, but two people break into each other with swords, anyway.
