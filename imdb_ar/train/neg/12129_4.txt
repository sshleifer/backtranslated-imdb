Before this film, I saw only two films by Andrea Bianchi: The Amazing Zombie Le Notti del Terrere (1981), famous among the horror lovers for the unforgettable performance of Peter Mann Park, and the funky man of your murderer. None of the films were a great part of the cinema, but both were admirable in their own way (and the fact that they showed a lot of dread and nudity was not hurt). The carnage, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite a few spots and the strange place of the naked naked body. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where crew and crew cast a horror film while filming, is confusing and tedious: when blood does not flow and no skin appears, the film is a real struggle to sit down (it took four attempts End), with endless scenes of unwanted characters who quarrel among themselves and perform little observation. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest to the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used many death scenes to release his huge film, Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). If you have already seen this film, there is little reason to worry about the carnage.
