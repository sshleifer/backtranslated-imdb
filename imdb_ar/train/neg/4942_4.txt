Every new autumn offer is worth, at least, a policy of "three strikes and you are out of the game". I give comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, three full episodes. After episode 1, I actually said to the TV, "Cancel tomorrow." That was bad. I have now seen the first 4 episodes of "Caves" and have not yet managed to smile. Not titter, guffaw, chortle, in fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am missing something clear in this exhibition. I simply do not "get it", but I think comedy on a prime television network at prime time, just must be funny; but there are no laughs from me yet. There is no way for ABC to offer the least entertaining comedy ever at 8:00 pm. I know there must be an inner joke that does not catch my mind. I have read all of the previous comments, "I get" her social side, but where are the jokes ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I get the moment of the lamp and hit myself in the head shouting "Eureka".
