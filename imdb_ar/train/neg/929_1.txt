My wife and I love to rent stupid horror / science fiction films and watch them with our friends for laughter. We saw this on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this movie is terrible, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, acting, working with a camera, story, fashion, is just a fad and a low budget but that's what makes it good. I think in one scene, the actors seemed to be walking around. I really hope that everyone who made this film is not serious when they made it because if it were, it would be sad. If you want to watch really stupid horror movies just to entertain them, I highly recommend this.
