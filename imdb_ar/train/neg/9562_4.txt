I think this could have been a decent film, some of its parts are fine ... but in its entirety a movie B. The same for the scheme, the parts are fine but have many holes and anomalies that do not add up quite well. The behavior is mostly fine, I've seen worse than this too. :) Beginning level is set, with cars driving in the desert, making it "cool" but unnecessary jump through some small sand dunes (in slow motion! cool!), like the drivers did not see Sand before ... it becomes a little better than there, but not too much. <br /> <br /> If you rent this, get another one too and use it as a warm-up. Make predictions low and may work with you.
