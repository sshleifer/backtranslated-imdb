This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. It's so bad that I found it very enjoyable. Representation, my God, scenario, you must be kiddin '. How can you imagine that the writer comes up with things like: - A child makes fireworks at school, and fireworks are very powerful, when someone gets hurt, flies a hundred yards back and explodes. - Girl trapped in Seiler, the killer tries to open the door. I got training, but the wire is not long enough. It first makes the extension wire, the horror, and then, when you do, you drill through the door and drill through the killer's head. F. There are many such examples. Oh, and what happened to George Kennedy, used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
