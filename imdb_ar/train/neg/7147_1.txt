My favorite part was when the credits started to scroll. I wish I could give it .00000000001 out of 10. I really wish to come back for that hour and thirty minutes. Do not waste your money or time on it. I could see grass growing and feeling better after the wings. <br /> <br /> Nadia was really beautiful and I hope the film did not ruin her career. But she chose to be in it. <br /> <br /> In general, you suck more than any other movie you suck. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That says something. <br /> <br /> No <br /> <br /> Do it <br /> <br />
