I have seen my fair share of badly studied endings and final changes of films, but I do not remember any film that committed a candid suicide like this one did. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had clearly hoped that the "Great Crash" would "surprise us all", and he did, but perhaps not the way the directors had hoped. I was surprised that Conrey, Harris, Fisborne and Cabsho had nothing to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The movie was fun until the last thirty minutes was very fun and loved the way the story unfolded and the nature of the film in general. But once the distortion was revealed, the plot's holes and contradictions were remarkable, and the main motive for revenge was a misguided perception, and the ways in which things were worked out accurately for Bobby Earl were far from ironic. Worse still, once this development is revealed, the remainder of the film is highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> Harris made a great performance and Connery was like Morgan Freeman because he never made a bad performance, even if the movie was not great! All in all, it starts well and reveals the viewer's interest. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable dives in the history of cinema.
