Title creatures wreak havoc in a small, peaceful desert city. These are basically the full plot of this film, and although the scenes assigned to the Munchies themselves are somewhat enjoyable (in a few accessible way), the rest is just stuffing, and stuffing it badly. From the "hero", a sad Allen Wannie wannabe, to the stupid city cop, it is difficult to choose the most outrageous personality in the film. At times, almost all of them were on the screen together and I was thinking, "Well, at least the friend is nice, but why do we have to bear it with the rest of these freaks?" The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which may have already been dated in the early 1990s. (* 1/2)
