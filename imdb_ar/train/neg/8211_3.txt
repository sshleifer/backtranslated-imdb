I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer, I was fascinated by it. Then I immediately took a DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it back in 98, and I like it kinda. Well, I've seen it again with full knowledge of the book on which it is based. When they enter Lhasa, people begin to take their tongues out of their mouths, and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that the way to say is hello to Tibet, so they live again ... in the book Who explains Harrer, that the suppression of the tongue is a sign of humility and absolute loyalty in Tibet and may do so in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two Europeans! Not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses in the audience. In his book, Harriere mentions that no one in Tibet was wearing glasses until that time (he forgot to be sorry, but it is also explained in the book). He did the Dalai Lama, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! What about it Mao Zedong looks like, destroy the mandala in front of young "living Buddha"? Childish ... tailor-made Harrier clothes and Tibetan Aufschnaiter does not fit European designer! Why are many of the events that have already taken place from the story eliminated, just to fill the time with fantasy interest in love (female tailor ...) is not quite important? Just like the whole story about Ibn Harrers, Rolf. He did not mention a word about him or even any of his family members in the book. But that was good for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about someone who hates others. About Tibet. I am very disappointed by this "adaptation" of the famous book. I bet that Heinrich Harrier was also ... 3 stars, just for cinema.
