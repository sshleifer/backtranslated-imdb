This movie is not worth your time. His adoption of the mysticism of the New Age serves as an almost interesting distraction. This plot is recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> He just asked me to spend some time commenting when I noticed that some tried to enhance the reputation of this nonsense. Their motivation and objectivity are questionable, because they encourage you not to look at the mistakes of the films, but in their good-faith message of the New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> So it would be okay for 20 to 30 evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists, to make positive ratings about movies / television that support their views? Despite the bad qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historical bases? I do not wish it. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the followers will come behind me to say the flowering things about this film, despite the fact.
