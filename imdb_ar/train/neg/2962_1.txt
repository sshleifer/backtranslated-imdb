Movies about dinosaurs can be amusing. So can movies Whoopi Goldberg. But Whoopi and dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to one conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, despicable, wicked and infamous in its present to the public. Nothing is made that bad. This is the visual equivalent of the torture room. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not make great films (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers do not do it "T - She's a tough cop here, again. > <br /> <br /> Have you seen a million friends click this week? Well, there's one million and one. <br /> <br /> Do not you like the cute, animated human dinosaurs since the Spielberg TV program? ! <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who hate chasing cars, shooting, slow dialogue, boring future Forex and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a tax-like movie <br /> <br /> You are reading this review until the end ... you are worth a sequel ... seriously ... <br /> <br /> No stars and no one ...
