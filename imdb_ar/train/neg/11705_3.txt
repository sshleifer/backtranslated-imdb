The crowded Melodrama is the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman, whom I saw very easily. Even its luminous presence in the screen can not save this slow motion and sluggishness which is almost impossible to watch without redirecting much of it. <br /> <br /> Just for Bergman fanatics fanatics; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you watch "For the bell bell" instead.
