The IMDb guidelines state that you must state whether your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is a spoofing film ... a warning story glorifying what you are warning of, a story of lost youth who do not know where to go. <br /> <br /> I've seen this at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film was not only bad, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> The representation is inconsistent, and the characters are mostly clich√© shows with little depth, and Farnsworth's representation was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From his sponsorship accents to the useless plot line to the "fee" elements not shown in the dialog box and the duplicate scenarios ... I've absorbed the big size. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for some of the most modern Cowboy Cowboy and updated with a touch of "natural born killers", but it is not a sensitive place for characters like the former and nowhere as shocking (outside some gore level frenzy) The ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, there are those who need to a) really edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things there to build on and deals <br /> <br /> clearly with the theme Worth ... if the pork was thrown into it try.) B) Edit the movie. If it is cut into a kernel, it may be acceptable. <br /> <br /> I'll go less than 1 if I can ... like maybe zero kelvin.
