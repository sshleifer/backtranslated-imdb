A documentary film has been tampered with about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. I photographed it as fun and safe ... but a sad place, a group of sex workers were playing in a football team, gathering in what did not seem more than a week! The main focus of the documentary is to prove that society represses this type of "worker", although no solution has been found for these poor women, but the people who have documented it have made them a sort of "star" (just like the title says so). In exchange for exploiting it to make this realistic documentary. It has, however, its documented reality ... but, unfortunately, has nothing to do with the main line. I would not accept seeing it again; but I would recommend it for general cultural purposes only.
