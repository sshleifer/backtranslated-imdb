I think I'm coming late to the concert. I've just seen a 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I did not know it existed and I was quite ready to watch the 1963 movie version when I ran it. <br /> <br /> I've played with Albert for a long time and I'm thinking of putting amateur production to show because I remembered it being a lot of fun to do. I did not like this newer version. It's not just enough fun. It was not colored. They lacked the abundance of young people. The lighting was bad. No one seems to mention this fact. These are not musical moods, they are bright and won. The lighting decision was a bad creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye, bye bye, is a farce, a comedy of mistakes. I had no meaning in this version. The lighting was awful and reduced to overall performance. The numbers seem to dance anemia as well. We have music videos today. At least the number of dances should be measured for some of the best ones, or what about some of the best Broadway. The choreographer was asleep on the steering wheel as it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were very talented, there are some very bad choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin artists there, it is not right to choose one of them as Rosie. Vanessa is an African American, beautiful and talented, but mis-casting. Jason Alexander's effort was amazing, he always did a clever job, but it was not Albert. I have been miscast and I think this is obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The middle of the movie is not a stage vehicle. There should be a translation from one argument to another. The abundance of musical theater must be translated into film. There is no advantage of being faithful to the theatrical scenario when filmed. Spirit, the essence of production must stand out. To me, Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 production was bright and vivid, while the 1995 production was as bleak as lighting and as drab as dance figures. It turned out that this was bright for the effort of many really talented people.
