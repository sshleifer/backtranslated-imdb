"Metamoprhis" is the story of a shattered young scientist, respected in the local college, under investigation by the financial services providers of the college. This forces him to take shortcuts in a melodramatic way in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My first thought after the conclusion of these films was this. "Not good, but not bad, as early as mid to mid-eighties." Of course, I realized then that it was manufactured in 1990, which pushed it almost to "4", but I decided to keep it on average "5" as it is. <br /> <br /> "Metamorphis" does on a few occasions, it looks like a good movie in a desperate attempt to get out. Representation, although not astral, is often qualified. You can even see the occasional gloss with modest quality. Speed ​​is a big problem in the film. After thinking that I was watching for ninety minutes, I realized I was only watching one hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be well qualified to overcome this weakness. <br /> <br /> The lead, a rather attractive man who seems to be trying to steer mixed between Tom Cruise and Christopher, reminded me of Reeves mostly with Matt Dillon in "Wild Things". The heroine does a good job, but she does not distinguish herself anyway. There is the role of "slut girl" here, the actress do what she can with her, but she does not look so many. There is a child representative who can not decide whether to feel tired, cheerful or curious. <br /> <br /> Speed, as I said, is the worst problem in this film, until a final fight with the bad guy that will make the Power Ranger blush. It is strange and inexplicable, even the last scene, which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every trick a bad camera and over-pressure can compress in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent once seen on the "Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movies Package". There is nothing to return you, nothing to buy on its own.
