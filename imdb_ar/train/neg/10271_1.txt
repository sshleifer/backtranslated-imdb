This was the worst horror film I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, terrible and cowardly, and talked about a predictable plot! I will not watch this movie again and I will not recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, once the film started, I realized what I got. All they did for this film was copying scenes from many other horror movies out there and hitting them all in this one movie. Prank phone calls, Halloween night, psychic, one knife! It's very silly. I was not at all scared during the film, which I thought it was supposed to do horror movies. As for making the film, it's funny how they all talk about how wonderful and scary this film was. I mean how do you realize that movies are a cheap rip of "scary movie" for example. At least, he brought some good actors there, and then maybe he was pulled out as a good horror film.
