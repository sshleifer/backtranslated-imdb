This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise a film for some aspects of its production, but the highly irritating behavior of more than half the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of this film. <br /> <br /> The most common conclusion was that the bloke that designed the building was on the error of an avalanche. Well, <br /> <br /> Also, trying to get out of the snorkeling race will not work. Jogging 10 feet in some trees does not work. Unfortunately it does here. As mentioned earlier, the innate numbness and stupidity of some characters is ironic. In a closed space, with a limited amount of oxygen a four-year-old can inform you that shooting is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the film re-produces itself and gets some appreciation. However, if you have little intelligence, you will also find it difficult to bear most of this movie. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that many good stories are not being produced, yet someone will pay for things like this. <br /> <br /> Oh, did you mention the last five minutes? Well to give you a link you have to watch to watch the latest crash techniques. Totally priceless.
