If you really want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: 1. Look at the TV menus. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When "men in white" comes, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> That's it. After sitting for two hours of bad puns, horrible film references (not that funny), and experimenting with something that has the least production values ​​ever in modern history, you will waste two hours of your life wondering exactly why. Why did you do this? I was stupid enough to think that this movie might be really good. It was not. <br /> <br /> But, on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you may discover some familiar faces during the movie. Saban (which also manufactures Power Rangers) to save on production costs is supposed to save the old monsters' clothes freely from the privilege of spawning in everyone's favorite games throughout the film. I spotted a large number of old monsters from the episodes I saw when I was a kid, so I think it can at least be said to contain some nostalgia. <br /> <br /> But, if you want to see the actual power of Rangers monsters, go watch Power Rangers itself. It is much better than this piece of garbage. (That says nothing!)
