We laughed our heads. This scenario is incredible, you either go to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a sea captain for 30 years and could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <br /> During his experience as an officer once claimed command on the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and (sorry) ** t on his desk. Of course, this was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give training at that time is just Hollywood text. When a captain is put in detention, he is detained, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well-protected room. He can not escape, it's like prison altogether. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my father had a dog on board, however, we see how he was allowed to urinate in the control room. This is not done, ever. My father cleaned up all the chaos that the dog had caused. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars to which this film is attributed, and all that remains is bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people are still alive in Kursk, this movie gets an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about renting a submarine: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
