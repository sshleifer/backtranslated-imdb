I already know that critics and some audiences say it was satire, and there were many political and social messages, names referring to some other names, and so on. I can not realize such things (I do not want to do them anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "cinema". For the film itself, again it is said that the film is very intelligent and powerful. I could not see anything we did not see in monster movies except for the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, this scene says some things about humanity, but it does make the movie great. The film is fun (moderate) and sexy in some moments or scenes, but nothing more. As for the biggest flaw in the film, it is visual effects. It was a shock, and I could not assemble myself for a while, because I was expecting a real monster, because it was not one of the old Gojira movies, it was produced in 2006, but it was not. It looks like you do not believe there is a monster, you can not pay attention to it. If you agree with me on this subject, I strongly recommend that Cloverfield be very realistic. Monster design is not interesting, but at least it was planned, there is effort. Strongly strong criticism. Some critics talk about it like a Kurosawa film. Yes, it is rather drama, not excitement or movement, but it should not mean that it is very powerful. I do not want to compare the Host to other monster movies, but I'm trying to mean that The Host does not do anything that other monster movies do not do. By the way, some people may be calling the film masterpiece because of their sympathy with Asian cinema. Yes, I like Asian cinema too, but that's the truth.
