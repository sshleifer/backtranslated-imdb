I was not impressed with this film, which contains faint music and only lasts 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was falling asleep. Excellent use of photography interval to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. <br /> <br /> Preferential is the predecessor, making excellent Koyaanisqatsi in 1983 in 87 minutes and to prove that the sequel could be better than the original, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try them both.
