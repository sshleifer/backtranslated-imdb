Now, I have not read the original short story to see all the literary points that have gone wrong here, so I will not walk in this path here. <br /> <br /> But I've learned for some time that Stephen King's films are simply not horror films, with some exceptions. This was not one of them. Things started well enough and I would not complain once of acting, although Fred Gwyn was fantastic as usual. I would also forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as it was necessary to make the story here move forward. . <br /> <br /> But there was one fixed point I could not help, but I was upset. This came very close to the end of the film, and at least two people participated in stupid stupid activity. The moments I have referred to are: a little coma revolves around the house. I doubted it was under the bed. <br /> <br /> (a) Get as close to your bed as possible before blindly lifting your quilt cover, and completely exposing your body to any damage that such small, unleaded cannibals may inflict on you, > <br /> (b) Stay away from the bed so that you can peer under the fully open end of a slightly safer position, or at least see the little terror coming to you, giving you little reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with a. I feel like I'm giving myself up for the massacre today. Bleh <br /> <br /> A fun movie though ... not too scary.
