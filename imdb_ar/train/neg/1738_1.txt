This miserable film is a remake of 1927 film. They should have let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a huge bomb! Douglas Fairbanks does not show any charisma here at all. CÃ©sar Romero is going into a real jaunty role and singing the house of Gabel with a choir - what I will do to this Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot deals with the image of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who was saved today by killing the conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move quickly to 300 years, where Gabel, married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation when there is an invasion night by Hungarian soldiers on the night of her wedding. <br /> <br /> Romero is behaving cowardly and fleeing before the arrival of the army. Disguised as a gag and forced to stay in the castle when he pleases violin on Fairbanks. The end is worse than the miserable film when Jable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - the angry Romero has annulled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This bad tradition of a film was made in 1948. In the name of Harry Davenport died in 1949 a veteran supporter. This should be his last film. What a bomb that will be launched after this distinguished profession. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is starring but can not do much with bad writing. Fashion looks more like the ones that will come out of the Stone Age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
