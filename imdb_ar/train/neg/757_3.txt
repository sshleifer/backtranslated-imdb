My children watch the show every day. It is a great program for young children. However, they must stop showing reboot and do some actual performances and get rid of RONES and DEDY YELLOW TEETH. "Moe" is the only Doodle panel with clean white teeth. Children notice these things and ask if the two do not brush their teeth. Does the offer make way to the United States, and if so, where can we find its timetable? And another thing if we can add. Mo need to stop hiding a lot. Sometimes when it emanates from where the younger children do not scare and what is with pulling the rope? what does that mean? Some are then wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their presentation instead of the same first. Children loose interest in this way.
