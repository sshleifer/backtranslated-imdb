Whatever the advantages of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the film shows the local people in Iran speaking Arabic, not Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the least knowledge of the region or country. The scene can not be different from reality. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: The train shows that it is operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no railways. Turkish ambassador Fez (Red Hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the film was prepared. The Turkish ambassador's daughter actually wears Indian music, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers were intending to show a strange woman, and Sari was what they decided to make her curious.
