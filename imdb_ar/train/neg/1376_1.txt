Of all the films (I am a film graduate, if it's worth anything to you), this is the worst film I've ever seen. I know there are some of the worst I have not seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. I and a friend hired him one night because Dennis Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and backward. It's not supported! Her role was incredibly small! How did you make it on the cover!? IMDb does not even list in its film. The film was so bad, and we wrote a small note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it into the box. I have read something like "please save other clients from having to watch this movie completely and completely bad!"
