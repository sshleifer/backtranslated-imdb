Well, this is 90 minutes of my life and I will not go back. This teenage television film "California Dreams" seems "almost famous." The representation was awful and the story unrealistic. Do not make me start in the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, see what to do. You had to believe it was one of the hottest teams in the country, and there is not enough irony in the world to accept this one. The guitarist is seen as a heroin user, not because I blame him, if you are around this rotting band with senseless songs and wooden acting, I will also inject the horse. <br /> <br /> If you take music seriously over distance, avoid it at all costs.
