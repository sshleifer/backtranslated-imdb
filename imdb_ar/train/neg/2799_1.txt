Both script writers for this film are not worth working at Hollywood at all (and do not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. The most horrifying hour and some minutes of my life ... I kept watching just to see if it would improve, unfortunately for me it did not happen. <br /> <br /> Even in the end, credits made me anxious. I think there were not many people behind the film, so they had to slowly withdraw credits ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a wonderful guide to "How not to make a movie". Too bad I can not give 0.
