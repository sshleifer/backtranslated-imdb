Totally garbage. I liked Halloween and since then Johnny has been in a downward spiral. This is about drilling. We get it John. Pro-rescuers are scary! I do not have to produce an angry film that fills my cheeks to tell me. <br /> <br /> The speed is out here. It seems like John did not have much to do here. This is due to the fact that this junk was not written. There are countless times where the camera sits and waits for actors to look stupid or say something dumb. I love long cut. Very bad carpenter does not know how to use it. He needs to fly with Herzog and Fasbinder 30 years ago. Please John, stop fooling yourself and bored to death!
