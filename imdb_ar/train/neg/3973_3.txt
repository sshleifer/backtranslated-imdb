The acting was weak, but with a horror click, I can deal with it if the story is good. Not so. The initial event was a clumsy and lucid trick to exploit most children's love for children. well good. Quickly progress to "the place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I love the revelation of ghosts. Well, great - this will be a supernatural horror story, with rotting things partially in our world partly ... anywhere. Then the procedure begins to draw like a three-headed dog in a wave of cats and birds - is there a wicked force trying to attack them directly? Is there an evil force that is trying to attack them indirectly - make people do terrible things they will not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole area is a kind of psychological echo room where the surrounding strife can spread in the killing? Well, Stoma - perhaps just a mentally entangled little child "Delbert", a mentally retarded child missing his mother in a spasm like K-Tel Norman Bates stopped? Oh, yes - extra points: The only black character seems to be Pullman's grandson, "Our Gang." The actor plays it as straight as he can to give a thin dialogue, but the fact is that his goal is "I've finished doing a house!" At least they wrote it smart enough for the outta gtf out there. She was a bit silent with the little girl silenced and pulled out of sight, just as the chick was in the bathroom. Those were just two of some really tasty anecdotes in this film. The problem is that they are combined in heterogeneous ways, such as a bite of meat, a bite of chocolates and a bite of a gum bear. Everything wonderful on its own, but mixed? Bleah! This potential. the lost.
