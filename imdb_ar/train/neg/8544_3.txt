I was not quite sure where this thing went. These people seem to be interested in what is happening on some mountains. They are investigating, they have a narrow escape, they leave, they return, they leave, they endanger each other, sleep, are attacked by witches with fixed coffins, etc., etc. It seems that the man loves the girl, but he leaves her several times without protection. . She jumps back and leaves her again. You get this point. I think the whole thing is to sacrifice a kind of sacrifice, but I'm not sure, or turn people into magicians, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some scenes in the atmosphere, but the print is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are unusual. This is due to age or excessive use of night filters.
