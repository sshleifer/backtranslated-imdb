I could not wait to put this movie in the DVD player when I rented it. Then after I started playing it, I could not wait to get it from the DVD player. In fact I watched the entire film. My wife and I wait and wait for something funny to happen, but nothing funny happens. Reading box like would be really funny. The premise of the film looks good. Ben Stiller funny. Jack Black is funny. How can this film miss you? Well .... do not miss it! This is the "comedy" I have never seen before. No one I spoke with thought it was a bit funny. It's just a really lame movie. Trust me. Avoid it .... Avoid it!
