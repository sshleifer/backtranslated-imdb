I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although it was visually brilliant (for example, the use of colors was absolutely stunning), it was quite boring and disturbing (see Father / Son incest). <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is completely absent, and if you're thinking about the wonderful soundtrack of Michael Neiman (who wrote the soundtrack for most of the Greenway movies) then you can imagine the difference he is making. <br /> <br />
