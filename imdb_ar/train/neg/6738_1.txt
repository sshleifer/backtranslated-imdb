There was a lot of movies based on the same theme. One nice girl needs a handsome boy to impress the ex, and then pay him (guess what?) Fall in love with him, there is a little bit of sensitivity followed by a row before everyone arrives before the happy end ... ... this has been done several times. <br /> <br /> The thing is that I knew this before starting to watch. But, despite this, I was still looking forward to it. In the right hands, with a good cast and bright text can still be a pleasant way to pass a few hours. <br /> <br /> This was not any of these. <br /> <br /> This was awesome. <br /> <br /> A female bullet lacks the magic or intelligence that fails to shine until it ignites a spark in me. I really did not care if she "got her husband" or stayed lonely and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male, after a few words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to remove this arrogant appearance. I had no idea that living a male prostitute's life was the path to universal enlightenment. <br /> <br /> An unrealistic film full of unreal characters. It seems that none of them have jobs, they all have more money than the meaning, the groom who is still going to his wedding after he learned that his bride grew up with his best friend .... In addition to "I will miss you even if we have never met" !!!!! I can continue but I realized that I was wasting more time in this malice ..... I could be bothered by the introduction of a character just to laugh at the name "friendly" but in fact this was just a funny thing about the distance that happened in the movie.
