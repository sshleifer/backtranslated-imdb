Oh my God! (This is coming from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> Many have already been told by reviewers (who rated this piece 3 and below) that I fully agree with, I just want to add some things: <br /> <br /> Among the three men Who were forced to eat their own digestive products, were hacked by an ax, raped by a broomstick and their balls blown away - her former boyfriend suffers from the worst forms of torture while having to listen to endless and senseless chatter on the kitchen table (as we do We, but at least have a mercy button mute). <br /> <br /> We had the director cut the inverted scenes that are not Her end and the inverted scenes, and our suffering was over after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this nail at least somewhat likely were Emily Haack's breasts (one point). <br /> <br /> Forget about it ... Do not buy it ... Do not waste your time ... Your mind is very fried After watching this I feel the urgency to watch (suffering?) The "scrapbook" now.
