King Kong v. GODZILLA (1963, which I remember I got rated BOMB) is a practical introduction to the cult of the director of Honda. This is not necessarily the best? It's just that I learned to be more tolerant towards this lowbrow fare intrinsically! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually got two congresses for one price: a giant ugly ugly monkey and different from him looks worse! Live the simian creature in Mundo Island (!)? Where he appears as he fights a couple of other monsters, and endorses three humans. Of course, it falls on the blonde (and nice) heroine. In fact, the most interesting is fatale fam in the cahoots with the genius of the evil movie madness? Dr. Ho and athlete called the anemia look and the head usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> It hijacks King Kong and its hypnosis to recover the tenth element, which is an integral part of Arctic ice waste; it seems that the giant monkeys are more immune to radiation than their mechanical counterpart (and to ensure their full cooperation, which He even picks up his three "friends"!) Then the female factor changes in the heart and helps the heroes (one of them, usually an unnamed American) and is killed by Who. Kong eventually escapes to Tokyo, where he faces a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor escapes the chaos that followed in his branch ?? Which, at the request of a dreamgirl girl in Hong, crashed a giant monkey.
