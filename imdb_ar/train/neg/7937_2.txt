After 30 seconds, I have already realized that there is no real budget for this cheap knockout. The story is taken from great films such as The Texas Shainsu Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. I love this kind of movies, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Cycle, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and completely misleading. You do not care at all about what happens to the characters. The alleged bad guys are not so interesting at all and fairly typical. How about blood and injustice? Well, there are some, although they are fairly cheap and the procedure is performed very poorly. Two points, just for the dose and blood but do not understand that this is hardly worth a look, even for the hunting dogs ..
