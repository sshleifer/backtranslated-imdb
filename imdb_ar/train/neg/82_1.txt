This film sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The representation was terrible, and the plot was totally implausible. A long long story revolves around "terrorizing" these people by this pathetic "mad killer", but they have completely failed to fight in any way. This is after taking a camping trip, without equipment, and showing up at the camp site, which has already been assembled and fully equipped with food, clothing and girls' headsets. In addition, after the disappearance of their boat, they panic because they are stuck in the forest, but then her boyfriend appears only girls and they seem to never think that they can walk out of the woods as he did to reach them. As I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend talk to you watching him.
