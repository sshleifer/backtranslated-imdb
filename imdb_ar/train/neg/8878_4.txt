Judy Holliday won the gold medal in 1950 with a copy of George Cuckour from Born Yesterday. From this point forward, her job was to try to find something good enough to allow her to hit the gold again. <br /> <br /> Never happened. In "It Must Happen To You" (I can not think of a nice title, by the way), Holiday is still one variation on another stupid blonde who may not be stupid after all, but all about this movie feels that half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe is his first film role, can not gather enough energy to revive this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the film will end almost from the beginning, so it often sits waiting for the film to wait. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you love Hollywood you will enjoy this; otherwise I will not bother. <br /> <br /> Estimate: C
