I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Pitt in another good role after recently renting "The Nine Yards" - well worth the effort, but this was not. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the "Whipped" trailer was rather funny, and the plot that revolves around three New York Yorks was twenty days and everything was falling for it and being manipulated by the charming lady was worth it. So, I persuaded two friends one afternoon that this movie come with me. This review is my gift. <br /> <br /> In the first chapter, we have the three leading buttons, which recount their conquests at dinner. What should have been funny, or at least say, comes out pathetic. Was there any value to recover the three men and their confrontations that were supposed to come out of them? <br /> <br /> [And while I do not mind the vulgar movies, I kept wondering why no one at dinner turned around when the buttons loudly spoke about sex and catalog details. They do this every week at the same dinner? Do you think someone will complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other dinners are noticed in one scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. Everyone else at the dinner is deaf.] <br /> <br /> The second chapter contains the three buttons, all located in Mia and then rotting in the brain, failing to question each other about what is really happening between the four of them. I kept asking myself, as the buttons still behave as they were, what qualities do they recover in their vision to stick to them for longer than a single date? Do you start with brain rot? I kept hoping that Eric, a married friend, would become more than an annoying punching bag in this act. His role is to clearly advise on marriage. But why bother them to talk to him when they do not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> Chapter three resolves the plot there but by this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something really funny and I had to agree. The Scene That Explains All was enough to explain all the mysterious questions and dialogue sections throughout the film, but we only checked them from a list. ("Well, that's why Brad happened and Jonathan says this and ...") <br /> <br /> The laugh we made was more stupid than anything else. Even outtakes during credits were not too funny. In the end I have only the desire to warn people away from this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
