This is the biggest flipping in 2008. I do not know what a manager has his mind in creating such a big disaster. The songs were added without parking, and the story was extended to fill the gap of 3 hours. The most disgusting is the stunts of actors. It is like every person who has a superpower that can run between bullets is fire and nothing happens to her and one person fights with 100 people. Anil Kapoor was only the best performer, and he was always at his best playing the villain through the hilarious acting of Henglich ... Akki did a good job ... but the film did not forget it.
