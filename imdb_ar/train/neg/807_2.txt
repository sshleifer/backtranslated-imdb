I did not expect much from this TV movie. You should set the tape less than you want for the curvature of any TBS film starring Antonio Sabato Jr.. However, he managed to frustrate, and even failed to be a bad film. <br /> <br /> Every scene was by heart, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from dozens of movies and TV shows dealing with major commercial plots in the script, bowed and said, "My work is over." It's all vulgar, all the predictable, and worse, the actors have to look like they're taking it seriously (even when the plot developments are laughable). <br /> <br /> Give yourself an interest. Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for the craziness of grandeur. They deal better with it. Also, let anyone know that sitting through a "fatal error" is so completely.
