I'm watching this movie now on the WTN network because this is the channel on which the TV was turned on. It is a story that is not credible and somewhat boring about the fall of the wife of the minister, Alexandra Paul, in lust with a young lover (with the laundry box) played by Corrie Sever. There may or may not be a plot. Corrie whips his shirt off a lot and aramsa pad. I felt that it was supposed to be not good, which is why he is dealing with thin Alexandra Paul. It is not really important because I said he took off his shirt a lot, and I took a quick look at the split. There is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is only painful.
