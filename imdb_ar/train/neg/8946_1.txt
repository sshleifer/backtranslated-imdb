I think the shots and lighting were very bad. When I first saw it I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really discovered the real year of the film, I was shocked. I did not know that there could be a bad film made recently. This is really all I wanted to say. This film has a good plot, nothing you can not miss if you read the novel by George Orwell. All I really want to say has already been said except this: I can not believe that this film has probably won many awards and nominations. We were given this one (bad) award film, because I felt it was very poorly made. Well that's all. we will miss you
