Polyester was the first film for John Water I saw, and I must say that it was also the "worst" movie I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> The Water group includes a group of people I'm sure is working for food and was ready to say the lines written by Waters. Everything about the film is horrible, acting, free, and the story about a woman playing 300 lbs transsexual was absolutely silly. <br /> <br /> However, I must recommend this movie because it is very funny and you will not believe the crap that happens to poor Francais. Her son swallows the solvents and tramples the unsuspecting women's feet in the grocery store. Her daughter is the most slut prostitute in town. Her husband is a punctured hole from a pornographer doing all he can to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Edith Massey, Francine's only friend, played the worst actress ever. Edith looks like she reads lines from a braid card and never saw the script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the Fransen clashes, Waters launches the end of Hollywood and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
