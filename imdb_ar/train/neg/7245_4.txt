I'm not keen on The Pallbearer, it's not too bad, but very slow at the time. As the film progresses, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing wonderful. I really liked David Schwimmer and I think it's good here. I do not like Gwyneth Paltrow, but I do not mind her sometimes and she's fine here. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like potential customers, you can enjoy it.
