The plot of House of Games is the most powerful thing: a writer and psychologist deceived by a gang of murderers, but in discovering the evil part of herself who enjoys the excitement of what they do, they eventually avenge her. It is about the stadium: but someone has to take responsibility for his appearance as a puppeteer. Director Mumit: Lindsay Crosse had a variety of television and film career, so she could not do it badly all the time. She was supposed to move from a long, cool, professional-controlled time to an evil, fast-paced lady you enjoy, as evidenced by the change from the beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three straight days, including lingerie) to the floppy dress Flowers. But everyone seems to be talking about their lines in the same precise way; I imagine that Mamit wants to make sure not to delete a syllable from the scintillation scenario. The effect disturbs and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense that he supposedly tries to create. Sometimes, the Games House loses any connection to how people actually behave or speak, and becomes just a mechanism to get the plot out. Sound music vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz does not help either. The end result is that the only entertainment you have to get is guessing the result, and the sooner you get bored the more you get bored with the 2D mechanical displays. They smoke a lot !!!
