After being pleasantly surprised by the performance of Sandra Bullock in Miss Congenital Miss, I decided to give you the game of "murder". Although Ms. Bullock's roles in "serious" roles in benign roles and self-sufficiency (see Hope Float, Speed ​​2, 28 days) leave much to be desired. Her character is at the same time science faculty, confused and heterogeneous (the sub-plot of Sandra's past appears as an unnecessary filler and does little to develop her already shallow personality). The young boys did well, although their forensic experience and attitude to catch up with others had stupid mistakes, shouting "We did it!" Chris Ben as a very obvious suspect is wasted here, as with the character of Ben Chaplan in the interest of the partner / love. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to the TV plot of the week you have never bought entirely in the motives of murder in the first place, and as we have mentioned, stupid mistakes (vomiting A rare food in the place of murder, all very comfortable and framed by the school concierge, the two boys who cling together in public places, a comfortable love interest to cause friction, etc.) are making the vision shift from conspiracies to boredom and disappointment by killers. The finale was precisely "in numbers" and probably the most frustrating aspect of the film. Using the vulgar tactics of showing the climate scene almost at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience with how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes did not surprise anyone and missed the alleged so-called intelligence of the film to reach it as a finale. The concept is fairly promising, but its implementation is weak and weak in almost everything. * Away from the place ****.
