Stereotyped, derivative, non-original and boring. The famous stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) offer far-off performances of their best, which is justified; both have superficial roles and personality traits mainly mentioned in the dialogue. Heston is a sheriff "I love the world better than before," and Coburn is out of the law "owe something to the man who imprisoned him and has to pay his debt." In addition, Heiston is so old that he has a riding problem and that Coburn is average and difficult but not cold-blooded as some of the bad guys. It is clear that filmmakers have not been able to come up with a single original idea of ​​how to make this film somewhat distinctive. (* 1/2)
