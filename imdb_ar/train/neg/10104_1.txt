I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a piece of complete crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as Ed Wood's. No, I've had a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but that's not true; the idiot who took out this trash is the worst manager ever. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was an office in a warehouse with a "police station" sign hanging on the wall. There is a manual fight where the punches are clearly missed around TEN FEET. <br /> <br /> This cop attracts women and restricts them and leads them to a warehouse. Tells his policeman partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a bag of coarse cloth. The policeman's partner believes that there may be something wrong, and that his partner may be a bad policeman who kills these women, but he is not sure if this is happening because he is a moron! The dialogue is completely stupid, the representation is terrible, and the characters behave in the most stupid way I have seen on the screen. It is quite clear to the policeman's partner that he is abducting these women illegally and slapping them and taking them to the warehouse and returning to the car with a bag of coarse cloth with an object in it, yet the partner who is there all the time, does not know what is happening! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a complete breakthrough. I stopped the movie in 30 minutes because I could not see it anymore. It must be one of the worst movies I have started watching and I will not waste time writing this review. <br /> <br /> No value at all.
