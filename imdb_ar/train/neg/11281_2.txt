I have given this film a high rating for the two stars, as I personally appear in the 42nd and 43rd minutes of the film .... Scene of the strip on the side of the road in Russia. In this scene, the film director gave me the immortal line - "$ 50 ... you drink and talked", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak a more persuasive Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take this part talking on. I've been a bit excited because this was my first experience in the film .... who knows ... these lines can end there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Honestly, I'm not giving a damn." If I talked about this line, my name would appear in Rancid Aluminum balances as "Heavy 1" instead of the name Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> Over time, I consider myself lucky because my name is not associated with this film in any way. <br /> <br /> Although I spent a whole day in the group, no one can tell me what the real story is in Southern Wales, Barry Island. All the restaurants and the wardrobe woman agreed that she seemed to have a lot of insults and nudity in it ... it was certain that things would have gotten worse if I ended up naked in this very horrific movie .... </ p> <p> Still ..... On the plus side .... I got chatting with Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, because "Notting Hill" was not released yet, not a hint of being Welsh. I made indecent comments about what Barry Island has been since my childhood visits there in the 1970s and 1980s. Only when Keith Allen appeared I realized that I was in high quality production ........
