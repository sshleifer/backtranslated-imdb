This movie is exactly what you will get when you increase your abilities. It is like someone who has passed the driving test, then put it in Formula One Grand Prix (I can not add it, the Grand Prix in the United States, where everyone can pull out due to dribbling tires and only win) , This is how short this film is. Now do not take this wrong way, I love B-Movies, about half my collection is made of B-Movies but I do not think there are enough characters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> The first story (for B-Movie) is not so bad. But what really follows is the representation, and I do not think in any second that it's like watching QVC except that the QVC bidders tend to have a heavier color. <br /> <br /> In short, I would like to say I have seen worse films, but I can not.
