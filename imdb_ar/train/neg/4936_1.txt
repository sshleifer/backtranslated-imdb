I wasted my time and was given this opportunity. This should be one of the worst new offerings. If they give a prize to show that this one sucks you must sweep the class. The representation is lousy and the storyline intrigued. Now the dinosaurs were a little weird but at least they were amusing. This show lasted three seasons and was finally curtailed. This new offer, based on commercials for insurance companies, is not funny and has nothing. It's possible that original commercials and the amount of times they were and are still being repeated are the fault of this offer. It's already on TV, we're tired of seeing the "cave man" characters.
