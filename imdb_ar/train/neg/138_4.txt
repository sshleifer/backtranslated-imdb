Well: I liked this movie because it was the first horror film I've seen in a long time that really scared me. The acting was not so bad, and the killer of Cupid was credible and troubling. <br /> <br /> Bad: The storyline and plot of this movie are very weak. There was not much to do. The ways in which the murderer killed his victim were horrific and disgusting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore. <br /> <br /> In general: good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** Out of *****
