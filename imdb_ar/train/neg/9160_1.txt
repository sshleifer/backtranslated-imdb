This film was so bad. A friend of Netflix rented it and made me watch it. There are so many slips and loopholes that it is so impossible to even bother to identify characters and plot. What about these for example ... <br /> <br /> "Fairmont Airport" is surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's shirt miraculously appears during a phone conversation <br /> <br /> The priest's office Luxurious ... Completed desk folding card table <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look beyond the technical flaws, you will find terrible representation and representation. I was very surprised by the representation of a gay representative in a dazzling way to play with the right-wing religious fanatic. The opening scene, sitting in his immaculate flat, cast a kitty cat, was exhilarating. <br /> <br /> I salute the writer / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / dentist / composer (and whatever I did in this move) to get the film actually distributed like this. If you do not have something better to do, it may be a fun collective movie or even the basis of a game to drink but do not hire it for a strong story about homophobia and gay marriage.
