*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British-made thriller released in the United States by First National. Karlov is Dr. Sartorius who must leave his research because his money has dried up. Karlov is forced to retreat to France and start a medical practice. It was suggested by a complicit woman who wanted to get rid of her older husband. You know that Karlov needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karlov agrees with the proposal and will soon become the husband's personal physician. All the time, the wife wandered around the city with no good local playboy. Karlov then injected the old heater with the poison and began to move. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and discovers that the will has changed. When the beans are poured on the wife, they bother her and bite the son's hand. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Karlov's nurse has misled Karlov's analyst who was used to kill the old man. When Karlov discovers that he is not getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karlov and is underweight. The analysis shows poison, but not in time where Karlov abducts the nurse. <br /> <br /> To make the story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and runs to save the son who is about to be injected by Karlov. Karloff instead crushes himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karlov has the kind of crazy doctor he did in the orders of Satan and the man who lived again. However, it is strange to see him walking around cruelly and moving slightly. We never know why he goes this way. I think the director thought he made it even more evil. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the role of the wife of the timing shows something terrible. It has a French accent. Although they overestimate it, you can still hate it (or maybe hate it because of its behavior ...). <br /> <br /> Just below average for a Karloff. If you purchased a Sinister CINEMA VHS copy, the sound is somewhat choppy.
