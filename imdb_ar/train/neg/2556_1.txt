Well, I've been told all about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where anyone else already said what would be said. But the thing, I've seen zillions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews on all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> Acting is stupid. It's really stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness at the crash. The nun is nice though and a professional assistant who comes to take care of the baby. The three main murders in the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid the makers of this film are. They do not even realize that even ruptures can be frightening. We do not see how Grandpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve death, you do not sympathize with them. Uncle Tony dies in the garage in a way that can work better. We just hear his voice and see nothing!
