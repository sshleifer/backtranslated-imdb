If you enjoy movies like American Pie and Road Trip & Van Wilder, avoid this cinematic rejection at all costs. It is a waste of energy and resource agility that should not have been discussed loudly; much less is already recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst film I've seen in the last 18 months; a bad mind for 86 minutes full of run-time. If it were much longer, I would not be able to write this review without the use of profanity. Consider yourself cautious!
