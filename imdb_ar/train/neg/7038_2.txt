Ah, yes, in the 80s of the last century, the Age of Reganomics, Slay and Chuck and a group of other movement stars hiding in a remote forest blowing away. While I could not believe how movies such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who could forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Made money at the box office, they were caught up in thrilling festivals with their rightful place on the wing's agenda and very badly dated . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in the cheek that takes such kind of movies but you have to ask yourself did they need to fool in the first place? of course not . The TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - although it suggests that there is no real difference between right and left wing tyrants - and sometimes it looks more like a z-grade film than it sends. Maybe you?
