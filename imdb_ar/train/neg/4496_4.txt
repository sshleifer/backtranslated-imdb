This film is an annoying festival of bad design and weak in addition to attractive lines and lame plot. But lots of fun to watch. All it is is hilarious. The basic plot is a group of scientists of the future traveling in time to catch their evil fellow who is determined to destroy them all. They are attached to it in 1146. The "future" laboratory of scientists in 2033 is a 1980s-style room with a set of "futuristic" flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a barn. Actors offer their lines with unenthusiastic passion, which is difficult to understand since lines often shake the ground like "I've checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but it feeds you the entire movie in the first five minutes, and continues at a fast pace until you reach the medieval part. When Roger Korman ran out of money. He had to stop traveling through time and thus different groups. The medieval collection is mash mash of anything from the late tenth to the sixteenth century. Any costume you could find, they were using. I think the mail chain was not included in the budget, because men wore embroidered shirts disguised as shields. The scenes of the fighting are laughable, as the men themselves casually throw the swords of cardboard abandoned and die in death throws with a powerful blow. It sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The lines alone are enough to make you in a comfortable position and everything else comes together to create a wonderful B movie, if you're a keratologist, I suggest you see. Once you're done, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them point to all the really funny bits in the movie.
