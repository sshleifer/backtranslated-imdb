I must admit that I loved the first half of sleep. They looked good, the acting was the best, the story of childhood and the pain and revenge were interesting and moving. Hollywood movie superior. But ... no one has said so yet (at least in the last 20 comments), when it comes to courtroom scenes and Pratt Pitz's character followed his plan to rescue two friends, who were accused of murder. This film has been insulted by my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did anyone accept the false absence of the priest? If these two men were with him, why would not they tell that during the interrogation? memory loss? If you are a judge or a member of the jury, do you believe it? Is it wise to give the idea of ​​killers? <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this angers me. This film has great potential. 10/04
