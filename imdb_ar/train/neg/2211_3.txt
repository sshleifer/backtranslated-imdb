Ha ha ha ha! Funny - to summarize this film in a word. What was this nonsense "this thing", because it might kill me to use the word film!?!?! I hope the director and writer, the product does not mean to turn out to be good, because it certainly did not !!! !!! A scientist transforms his son into a hammer shark, and the shark kills a handful of people who the world has invited to the island !!! Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I was watching it I laughed at all the serious parts, because it was vulgar and unprofessional .... and could not make the shark seem more realistic, even though this "thing" has a slightly larger budget than most low films budget. All I am saying is watching this movie as he expects to laugh at all that is bad, stupid and dubious dialogue, because if you expect a good film, I would be very disappointed.
