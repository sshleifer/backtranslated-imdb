Well, we do not often have in the UK a movie filmed about the inner life of the city from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community, and the last example I can remember is the way Babel was underestimated in 1980. So I had great expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, It was promoted as the British version of La Haine! Well no hain it is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film an originality that has been missed in other British films lately, but what worries me is that this film ends sadly. <br /> <br /> The movie deals intelligently with a growing problem of blacks on black violence is common to everyone in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers are now using the kind of writing in the plot rather than the characters that are equally damaging. Saul Depp has a great opportunity to produce a film that can be amusing and inspiring to all of us, but he has unfortunately missed and created a film that reinforces the idea of ​​being a black guy in London. The only future is violence and tragedy.
