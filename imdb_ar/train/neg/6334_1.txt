I saw this film in 1979, when I was 17 or 18 years old, when it was released. The theater may have been 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes after the film, the only friend in the theater was the friend who went with me to watch the movie. The film was really strange and had no plot or reason for the scenario and people asked for their money. We decided to stay for the entire movie .... why carry such torture? ... here why. We wanted to be true film critics ... to have a standard for attributing all other films to the fact that it's hard to justify saying that you've seen the best movie (10) always come up with something better. But, it's easy to be able to assign all other movies to the worst movie ever produced (that is ... one film at best). There may be other films that are really eligible as movies, but I have not seen them yet. I am now assigning all the films that I see widely on the basis of this worst .... I am a real film ... it is.
