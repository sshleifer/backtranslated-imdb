Perhaps Elizabeth Ward Gracie, which is likely to be remembered only as one of Bill Clinton 's "Bimbo Blasts" (they have birth control pills for now!) Is the weakest element in this show. It really lasts in the tiring version of the Highlander series - facing another immortal eternal hero with past memories about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight in the end where you have a special cheap sequence of effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have Nick Wolf character. Basically, your typical hero is not yet shaved, with a typical "sexual tension" story. (Seriously, why Hollywood thinks sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a common Canadian / French production, so half the series takes place in Vancouver with the tradition of New York, and the other half in Paris ... just as Highlander did.
