* Review may include spoilers * <br /> <br /> Special effects that are predictable and have no effect. She has a TV movie feeling for it. The idea of ​​a United Nations dominated by Satan is an interesting development to the end of the world according to the Bible. The premise is interesting, but warned waaaay waits. If you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, at least make it a quality one! I was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of debris. I can not say much about this film since I saw it more than a year ago, and there is not much to say about this movie other than ..... skip it!
