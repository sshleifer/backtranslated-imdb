Believe me, I love horror movies. I love science fiction movies. I love independent movies. I like B low budget movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I even like bad behaviors, scripts, woodlines, impossible situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It does not work on many levels. For all the reasons mentioned above, and many more. This includes blatant non-blatant use of female genital images. And many hints of male genitalia, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is pure incompetence. Unlike some attempts to do something really different. I mean, any movie that needs years to shoot can not maintain the level of congruence and focus that modern audiences demand. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that the entire film was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. However, unfortunately, this was supposed to happen, where we saw things unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can express is that the picture in the end was enormous. If this was used at first, instead of the end, the film could have been allowed to approach when it ended in 2001 ... Unfortunately, they did not try it instead. I do not understand what was so important in this film that it was necessary to produce it. Was it the plot? Sure, it can not be. Were the characters? I doubt; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was the dialogue? of course no. Music? Perhaps, but probably the unrequited ego of school principals who need to be tough. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts have been made on the floor of the cutting room.
