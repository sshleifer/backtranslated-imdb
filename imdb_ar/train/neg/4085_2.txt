"Mr." John Gielgud must have become an aging representation in the mess of such a film. ; <br /> <br /> This is one of those films, I think it is considered "art", but do not be fooled ..... it's rubbish. Adhering to the "art" that you can admire in the frame because the films that are classified as such are usually forged as incomprehensible as this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud reads "The Tempest" to Shakespeare while the camera waits away from naked people. One of them is a small child urinating in the swimming pool. Wow, these are vulgar things and "art" real, right? This is just one example. Most of the story is meaningless, impossible to follow, and then liberal critics fear to say they "did not understand," so they give them high marks to save their false ego. Want Shakespeare? Read his books.
