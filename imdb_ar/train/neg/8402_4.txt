The Three Stooges in a Long West Feature Film? Maybe "Rockin" in the Rockies "was meant to combine Stooges' short comedy with Western music, in a play; if so, it was a fun way to break up on Saturday afternoon.Jay Kirby (like Rusty) is a handsome young hero; Beth Hughes (such as Jun Blonde) and Gladys Blake (beautiful women like Betty Brown) are beautiful women.Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group, their songs are very beautiful, yet these are the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film does not exactly shake. A few laughs, but Stooges's sense of humor is calmer than usual, and the modern horse is also untapped. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
