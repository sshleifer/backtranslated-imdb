*** This contains many spoilers, it does not matter, since everything is very patented *** <br /> <br /> Oh God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I come back home from a movie and said "I have to get IMDb and write a review for this now. This is bad this flick. <br /> <br /> * Start with depression * But let me mention one thing before I start. I'm not some big Harvard movies in Noir Winnie (actually, I went to college at the other end of Mass Street in Cambridge, where smart people who never have wealth and trust funds go, and you should put me directly in a group The comic census of the nerd-book movies is among the ones who will feel obsessed, and I still hate this movie ...). My display preference is High Definition Film, which includes Die Hards, Bond Hits, Clerks, and The Grail. I wish the Titanic never sank, not so much on the lost lives, but we were not exposed to the pile of Roth film. The only reason I will see a lively French film is whether Emmanuel Burt is young and often unpopular. We've given Maximum Overdrive one of the few precious 10s here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm shallow when you come, so I do not criticize this film because I'm looking for a level of film excellence - because Elektra stinks like a dead goat three weeks old. * End of Depression * <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot of bad here, I should try to classify them. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. Garner: One of the root causes you may wish to mention in seeing this flick is seeing too much JGar hot (I have no idea why my wife wants it). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo", the latter was the most sex film. Do you know the red outfit you're wearing when you wear every weird ad you see? I see it twice - once at the beginning, once at the end. the problem. In the rest, it looks basically like a Maurice form if a female - a lot of frown and black clothes. Which brings me to an incredible array of expressions that JGar shows in her work - from "peeking" all the way to "peeing and crying." Oh my God, you think she had to date Ben Affleck or something so horrible. Um, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAD GUYS / GAL: It shows about the same range of expression and representation ability that you expect from a low-maturity grapefruit. At least next to the performance of JGar, does not stand out very badly. The role of the man is to stand there and be huge, the other is to stand there and get out of things things, and the role of women is to stand there and breathe and / or accept people. They were able to pull these amazing exploits. The main bad guy has a tougher role than everyone else - he must appear at the same time a) angry and b) seem Asian. He does a good job in this. I think there was a bad guy / fifth gal, but my mind started to ban portions of this film in self-defense. <br /> <br /> Draw a dangerous mystery! This film contains many surprises such as a speech at the National Democratic Congress. Let's just put it this way - my wife, who was only in the United States for half a year and speaks little English - whispered this to me when the girl first showed up on the JJ platform, and I swear by God I do not make it: You go home to kill the girl and the father too. " This is before the father appears on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not taken care of by Mansa because of her gifts, nor has she ever been exposed to Dardeville or comic book type. I got this at .00015 seconds with no prompting and no previous information. This is the blatant clarity of this film. <br /> <br /> Rarely, before stupidity! Well, there's this big guy in the movie. He can take a heavy blow from the gun blast and shoot it as if it were light, and he can take a nasty Electra stab to the chest and bend the metal (or melt it - or something else - other defenses, thank God). But JG jumps on his head, explodes? A noggin Achilles? Okay! This is the stupidity of this amazing film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm beginning to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming, so I have to stop. But you've been warned. If you have to deliberately reduce frames to prevent yourself from watching this movie, do so. If Armageddon will come, please leave it before <This comes out on DVD.
