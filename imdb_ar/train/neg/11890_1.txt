Since the first time I saw the box cover for film and extended photography I thought of this man, a friend should be "Scwarz" like 6 feet or 6 feet and 2 feet. <br /> <br /> Its length is not 5 feet. Not this, is his fault. <br /> <br /> In any evaluation, I played the movie one wonderful night in Tucson, where I came out of the second floor with a good cigar and left it spins. At that time my wife had an affair and things were going on my plateau, so I needed a good conversion. But, the bad thing was the movie ... I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot too, I would admit it. <br /> <br /> Really, I've watched this movie several times. Always makes me feel good! It does not mean that it is very difficult to be quiet or that it is "very close" to getting to the mark of the motion film ... it is frantic. Then really ignorant. Then overheating again. It's best when it comes to chasing slow speed. Wonderful!! I have never felt safe in my life. Warm and very happy. I was grateful that they kept gasoline during the chase because of the low production in the summer months ... Anyway <br /> <br /> The trend was "uninspiring" in the movement and the combat series needed for its design, or when redesigned and tightened, It stopped delivery and did not reach you, but continued in the other direction. The "locals" in that village where they were, the town instead, were "unknown", as they apparently did not follow what was going very well, they would even look "staring" at the camera lens. Such as deer in the head light up a kind of things only some with a smile, smiling gazelles. <br /> <br /> I'm upset because "Columbo" I bet only that he has a good spirit and caring spirit for people in America as well as for his countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, the island of Barretta is very inactive and incredible. So I still like it so much. My wife x now hates her, but I love her! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I feel discriminated when it comes to movies I love or even "love". All in all, I love Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> A movie adds an attachment to this if you love to kill a few hours while enjoying watching it really, directly to B videos or "bad" movies to your small library collection, if you can find out see "The Big Sweat "(1991) with Robert Z 'Dar..you know the great man of TANGO & CASH. "Big sweats," a bomb for a policeman's story without discovering a real conspiracy and acting that is very lame, may well be "on the crutches" and at the end of the "big sweats" I think they ran out of money because they have a picture of the actors and set it on fire and let it burn during the credits. - Good fun. <br /> <br /> But overall, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave it a "1" rating and a "terrifying" general rating for a good "B". I am waiting for the sequel, perhaps like "Paretta's Revenge in Montazuma" (Franco takes a Mexican holiday and gets sick on the water afterwards, and declares war on the water company.) Or "Barita powder war" where he can share a big drug lord in his own and infect the genes chemically It creates an insect that is raised and dropped in cocaine fields and coke and when passing through impurities, it is a chemical reaction that turns coke into pure dried sugar. Then the other supplement had to save young people from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He can get a major toothpaste company to approve the project and partially finance it with careful product placement. right?(*)
