It's very bad when the film's summary contains more information than the movie itself. The Plot Summary written on the paragraph that was written on the movie page contains details I could not get from watching the actual movie. I found myself supporting it constantly to see the details I missed and that could tell me what happened (bleep). Unfortunately, but to no avail - this film absolutely excludes the brutality of the story, if you might call it a story. It seems like they were trying to fool us into believing that there is some kind of film here, where it is filmed enough to resemble the story and leave the rest to our imagination. Urgent News for Creators: I paid you a visit to watch your movie. I sit at home and imagine plots and storylines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This person did not show enough interest to be able to put the name on the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial shows I've ever seen for a leading character in any film, A or B. I figured her well, maybe she did not really want the role, just got a huge show for a movie she did not want to? Error. They were listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, do not book yourself as a leader if you can not act. If you can really, create a decent character to become. Also, someone mentioned here is a white / Latin issue - yes, I hate to say so, but this film shows up as a retaliation against university-aged white males wearing baseball caps. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film that the viewer loves to Latin characters. Adrian's character looks like a sloppy jerk that's no better than the story's opponent. As for the Mayan character, they do not look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed of Hollywood that this movie is made up.
