This film was a real disappointment to me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out they were making a film about him, I was very excited, got the film on the VHS when he came out, and I was impressed by what I saw. It was not about his life but about his death. I thought it would be a film originally from Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I was tired of hearing his death in books and movies, and I wanted a film about his life, not his shameful death. I was very disappointed. I hope people look at his life, more than his death. The only good thing about this film is soundtrack. This film is a disappointment to any fan of Pram Pons.
