This movie starts slowly, then stops working. After watching for an hour, seeing nothing at all, I came out. I mean, nothing happened. zero. Postal code. Nada. There is no story. The characters are mysterious representations of the most boring people that any of us know. Producers of this film may be prosecuted in a court of law if they try to sell it as a "proposal". There is no movement. I could tell the "story" itself with fixed images with a comment on it. Scenario prank. It's just awful. I doubt that any scriptwriter in the world can save him. My great regret is that I have not wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in Time of Money", but I missed a great chance to be a leader. I could have been the first to come out, but I waited for a long time. Instead, I saw about 20 people coming out in front of me.
