Pictures of ugly ugly gothic kids from college in a movie, throwing a little of the story and a lot of bad acting, and still I'm still not sure how bad this film is. Bad, bad effects, worse behavior. An insidious attempt at horrific horror. Everyone has shown this to get depressed kinda watching it. Sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are just something you want to end as soon as possible. Another sexy scene is just a mistake, even before you reach the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, and that's why I picked up this movie. But for you, save yourself time and avoid this abhorrent. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
