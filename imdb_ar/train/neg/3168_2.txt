I had to close this after about 15 executable moments. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to get better, <br /> <br /> What I saw was acting badly, was directed and written. <br /> <br /> This movie should not be released directly on DVD, <br /> <br /> The leading personality of the bride from HELL has a huge fall in the art of sculpture to kill her. She was a disgusting person I did not regret. We ended up in a kind of paradise and were still disgusting and left shortly after. <br /> <br /> Eve Lunguria conceived and I hope I never see her again, she is unable to act. It's just an annoying picture. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd was normally a representative who could not make a mistake in this mistake. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs is also no longer a teenager. <br /> <br /> I like comedy movies, but I do not like idiots around stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (from 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
