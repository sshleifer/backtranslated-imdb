The boring things we got here. His pants 5 minutes better than this. do you know why? Because there is only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long is this time. <br /> <br /> The plot is kinda ... erh .. The last half hour is ok and the rest is boring and not funny = (I had my hopes, and made the trailer look funny but the pace of this movie is fairly slow, unfortunately not funny, Only normal clueless clowns running each other and trying to make us laugh ... does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe next time Knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would lead To a lot of healing but at the moment not good.
