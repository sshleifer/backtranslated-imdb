I watched this movie a few days ago and jumped excellently through the scary parts. I must admit, I found it decent ... so I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Logical Problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her friend, who looks so dandy, does not make a sound while she is being killed. Do not you think he might at least try to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When it was announced that the gym teacher was "SOOOO in love with Lisa", she screamed on the screen almost. When your best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was loved by her, do not make such comments if you have a half heart. <br /> <br /> 3. Once Nash asks his uncle about the number of exits they have at home and the uncle who realizes that there may be a danger in the future, the smart thing is not getting Donna and her boyfriend, aunt and uncle in a car and driving Away, and then bumped into the house with the HRT and the police force so the killer could not get out? <br /> <br /> I can continue. and on. and on. Basically, the plot was decent, and the characters were not defined enough to actually feel any sympathy when it was slaughtered and there were a lot of mistakes. <br /> <br /> However. <br /> <br /> This movie may be useful for teenagers or young couples who are looking for a fun night out. If you do not think of all the idiots, it is a modest film.
