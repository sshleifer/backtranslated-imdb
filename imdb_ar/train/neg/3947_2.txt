In comic, humility is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays the role of Modesty Belize is very much like a fashion model. She does not have either moral or personal humility in comedy. Humility will not give women the advice to show more skin to make more money. I can not see any similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this film. His film "Mission Impossible" will be about Ethan Hunt locked up in the high school detention room talking to the doorman when he went to high school and Hunt had played the role of DJ Collins (on the road trip). If you love Modesty, do not see the movie, you'll get angry. If you do not know much about Modesty Comics that rents another movie, do not waste your time with this movie. I can not understand how Quentin puts his name Tarantino. I will ask for a refund at my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
