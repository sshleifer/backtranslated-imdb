I can not believe I'm so angry after I saw it, I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is just a rewritten Planet Earth. Now I knew that going into it was advertised as "one of the people who came to you in Planet Earth," but I had no idea they would blatantly use the same cuts as the leading documentaries. I paid only $ 8.75 to see something I already have on a DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is nothing original at all here (you can save the voice of James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of the finfish that I do not think they were on Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime of all is that while the planet uses the tragic story of polar bears as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for environmental change, Disney took that story and turned it into a family-friendly journey. After the demise of the polar bear, they showed that its marshes grew remarkably a year later, scattering some litter about their willingness to continue their memory, and that the earth is really a beautiful place after all. There is no reference to the great cubs impending deaths due to the ordeal of their father, nor a warning of trouble for future generations if we do not bring us together, nothing. Just a bunch of things that we've already seen during the film (and more times more, if you're one billion people actually saw the planet). <br /> <br /> I did not leave the theater I feel at all ashamed and cheated in my life.
