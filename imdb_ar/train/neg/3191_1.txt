There are awful movies, and there are movies so awful that they are long forgotten and can not be reached. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just cheese stuff; you know what I mean) are added to the mix too. What is the result of bad films with this nasty content? Why, "final justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Becker was the star of the film, and Joel & Potts assembled it in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place on the satellite of Love (but with the same robots), this trio became a mockery of the film Joe Don Baker II of MST3K, "Final Justice". Of course, many of the nasty things I mentioned in TV have been removed, but still, I want to watch this episode (and "Mitchell" too), because what "Joe Dislikes" most about? Why, nothing but "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have Big Lots nearby, check out this store for the glossy tape! LOL This happened to another user!
