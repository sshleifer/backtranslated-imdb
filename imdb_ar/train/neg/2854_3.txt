Dreyfus plays the role of mob leader who has lost his mind, but is now "fixed". Lynne is his girl who manipulated his first record (Gold Bloom), who is supposed to have something to do with Lynn's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone can think of as a Burt star, Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne and Kyle McLachlan can not help until Richard Pryor's appearance in the plot, because Dreyfus proves he is not "fixed" and tries Kill everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, not as if you did not know what was coming. The first ten minutes were only the guys trying to tell Goldblum what he was hiding when Dreyfuss came out, but I'll give you all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The actual reason for choosing this movie is because I was in Diane Lane's kick recently and try to watch all her movies. It was not the real fantasy for me just a terrible plot, but also the fact that it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we've heard about it throughout the film). Even being impressed with more than half the actors, can not help me enjoy this movie. The parts where the pendants were supposed to poke up found me laughing at what was already happening. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
