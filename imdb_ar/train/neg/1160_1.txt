This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) the story of a rebellious college basketball player, his strong but fair coach, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who suffers from constant breakdowns. The story is not going anywhere, there is no evolution in personality, no one cares about it, and performances, except Bruce Dern as coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could make such a film. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
