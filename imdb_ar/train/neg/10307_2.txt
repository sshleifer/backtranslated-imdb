The "math" aspect of this is just a gimmick to try to distinguish this TV program regardless of millions of other police programs. The only redeeming side to this offer is Rob Morrow, although his career must be (undue) diminished after the northern exposure if he participates in this schlock. <br /> <br /> Lame side "Math" is displayed in the show in one episode I participated in the championship Le Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that the show is the last resort of the curse.) In order to catch the fugitive, Some theories about "bubbles". Therefore, this long explanation suggests that if we see the suspect in places A, B, and C, then we can use the "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. He does it all on the blackboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can not remember). <br /> <br /> Anyway, when you look at the final product, basically took three points, picked a point in the middle directly said "Well, mathematically, here we are more likely to find the fugitive." At this point, another character points to "Oh, this point also happens to be the cabin where the man used to live." Is this math? It's not even contact between the ** k ** g points! This exhibition reminds me of the math specialty I used to work with in the field of banking, which had a mathematical analysis that he could do to "support" the points that everyone agreed with through less complicated analysis or basic logic. <br /> <br /> It is only displayed - when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait until they suspend the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA ... They will use calculus, they call for an air raid in the middle of the mountains, they hit Osama and do not even scratch the five children who use them as human shields ... cuz hey ... all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> A television program is completely ridiculous.
