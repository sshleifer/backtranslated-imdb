This is nonsense like watching dry paint. I am very disappointed because I was very excited to see him. <br /> <br /> Simply, the film does not make sense. If they are never manufactured, no one will notice or care about them. It's overpriced because of all the big names in it, but if "nobody" exists, no one will give this movie any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the midpoint of the movie I was looking at Vanessa Redgrave and I think, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like "Joy Luck Club" without any joy. She's "Oceans 13" (nothing but a large group of names) for her mother's daughter movies and totally anti-climate ... Oh so it's over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they all run for the Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk.
