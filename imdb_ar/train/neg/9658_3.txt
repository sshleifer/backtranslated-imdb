It reminds me of much of the same scene in Mel Gibson's film "We Were Soldiers" when "Do not Miss the Company, They're Just Lumped" and the other scene at Pearl Harbor when the British officer says to Ben Affleck: "If all Americans are like you, then God helps the nation that is at war with America! <br /> <br /> Put all three movies together and you will get enough bullying to fertilize the entire desert desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the final battalion may be real enough, but the film could have been done without All of the associated American vascular vascularism has been heard in cinema during the above scene Pearl Harbor (No kidding, however, the missing battalion is in fact a class of its own. <br /> <br /> "Americans believe they are unbeatable?" "I've actually stumbled and played near ponds. In all the flows that came out during this disaster (the movie is) <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were well made (3 stars for that) but if the text is written compost, then it is wrapped up in colored ribbons in bright colors, no Still compost, as writer James Carabatsus also wrote these other crackers, Humber Hill, No Mercy, Hartbreek Ridge, someone, please shoot him before Write any such trash. <br /> <br /> The manager, Russell Mulkahi, is also Australian, and God is a disgrace !!!
