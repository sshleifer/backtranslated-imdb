This movie is old, missing the mark. It is very far compared to 89 Batman who tries to coppy. That singer women what her name can not act, we see why her film holder died. Notice how this film died at the box office no one sees this movie on TV too. My uncle and dad were expecting Batman, and the movies were pretty much like Cop Rock. Not worth renting 3/10
