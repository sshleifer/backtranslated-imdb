This show is just annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors because they have to be funny (especially Bob Sagitt), the path of laughter tries to cover up the sad jokes and shows "Awwww" at the most unnecessary time. Excessive children in drama are no exception, especially Olsen twins. Also, this exhibition is the city of Clichy. If you're looking for the word "cliche", you'll read "Full House", each line of story has a "lesson of life" that can be learned in the end. Seamless speech makes everything better, and even has the ability to make the most savage child has a sudden realization of a bad GASP too bad and this can not be possible in real life. I do not know how someone can watch this show without talking about the misconduct of characters or the path of laughter. I find myself screaming on TV saying, "This is not funny / sad / cute." If life is like this, the world will collapse.
