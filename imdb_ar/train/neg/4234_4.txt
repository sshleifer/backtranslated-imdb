It's not the most well-produced film at all times, but for her, it's very entertaining. The plot is lame but the murder is not so bad. I must be honest, if you do not follow the bands that have appeared in this movie, you will not find this movie as funny as those who do it. You know someone who saw this movie and was really disappointed by the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was made in spare time while you were on a tour, between playing to separate children and drinking with friends behind the scenes. .. It is not made seriously. It is a favorite cheese at best and with more than 100 dead, most of them very clean, it's a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and fun!
