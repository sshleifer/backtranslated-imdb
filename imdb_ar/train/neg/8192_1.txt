Well, I have to say that this film was so bad that I would have gone out if I did not have to review it for work. Worst of all, I wanted to see it so badly that I drove my car around town and paid $ 10 for parking twice because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I've ever seen him play another person was in that movie with John Travolta. In any case, the plot has potential - it looked fantastic in the preview, but it is full of very silly, predictable and weak plot turning points. I was hoping that this was one Christmas movie, Christmas should not be saved, and Santa did not need an alternative, but the only wonderful part was horseback riding, and the little boy was the best character, I'm sure this movie would be great For young children, but for adults, it's so lame that hopefully they'll sit in it.
