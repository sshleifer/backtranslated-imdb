I enjoy slow motion drama. Birthdays in August, Chungking Express and Virgin Stripped Bare from their own Pacers, The Way Home, Springtime in a small town, Hana bi, Eat Drink Man Woman, Dolls, The Mood for Love, Spring Summer Autumn Winter Spring, are all fun movies ?? For example, but not limited. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a subset of movies within this type of drama that try to ride coattails of good movies while not offering anything that intrigues themselves. These are what I call IAN movies? "Uncanny technical nonsense." Tsai Ming Liang is the king of this subtype, and the Lamphor is a "masterpiece". In fact, this is a de la creme cream of rubbish rubbed with crap under the guise of "art". People walk around their apartments, drink water, walk back and forth, waiting for paid phones to become vacant, hanging posters, staples together, going to the bathroom, eating, exercising, having sex, slapping mosquitoes, "No joke when I say that this is an accurate summary of the entire film, which is the perfect poster of the stale technical trash." No plot, no story, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no purposeful dialogue, and more importantly ?? No drama. <br /> <br /> The most common scene has two people "kneeling" on the bed with a person who is sleeping under the bed - irony that is also completely tasteless and unjustified.The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically nonexistent. As if it were related to anything to the viewer with respect to those persons other than the obvious fact that they wanted to "make a fuss." He is fond of drinking water, getting out of the watermelon, and the stroke itself.This is Cai's idea of ​​"personality development." The artist is really misguided. <br /> <br /> Cai may actually contribute to Vive At first, the main actress, walking all the way from one end of the park to the other for 285 seconds in a row, appears hysterically crying for no reason at all for 356 seconds in a row . The film then ends abruptly. Useless. No entertainment. Just torture pure and focused on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Try to beat the dead horse. The basic theme of the unit is dealt with so much that the only true feeling of this film is bored. In fact, Kiyoshi Kurosawa offers a much better show of loneliness in his horror film "Cairo". And imagine what? It's actually interesting! This film moved very slowly like molasses in January, but there are better ways to address the concept of the unit of absolute waste known as Vive L'Amour. Kairo is a perfect example of this. <br /> <br /> Cinema fans may thank Tsai Mingliang for taking the film out, providing compelling evidence that home cinema can be made just as easily as B makes horror flicks specifically designed for television. Artistic cafes have now officially lost the base of self-righteousness. The quality of this valuable genre now overlaps with movies such as Army of Darkness and ?? In moments! ?? Show girls. How do apples love them?
