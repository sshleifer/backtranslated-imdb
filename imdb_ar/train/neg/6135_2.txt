America needs the best man to win the "game". Who will hire it? A gymnast (my brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the skills to win a game involving the ninja, a crazy village and Richard Norton, who Kurt Thomas told him to "keep his equipment in his trousers." (His words exactly) I've missed this in the theaters and that's a good reason because I might have been kicked because of laughter that broke into him at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my mind was how lame these ninja if a gymnast could kick the ass. Kurt Thomas looks like 5 feet 4 and barely strikes someone as "the best man for the job" as with the influential Kurt Thomas talent, well if you can not say anything nice ... seriously though one has to wonder how much was used Cocaine to make a very stupid idea. The decision to cast Tara Reid as the only scientist is at the top of the narcotic scene here. For 18 years although this was the title of the dumbest film I have ever seen. To say that I could not find this impossible, I laughed so hard that I suffocated to death. Twice. In the 1980s, a film could be produced with this bad idea. Although this film is the only film in which the protagonist is too slow, he can not even pull a hollow sword from the ground. This is the most wonderful film ever, and one of the most ridiculous movies as well. <br /> <br /> * From 4 - (Bad)
