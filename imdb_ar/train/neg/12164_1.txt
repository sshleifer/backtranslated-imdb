This film is not good. The first film was almost full, but it had an unreal ending to make it worth watching. This film has nothing. There is no panic or zero tension or suspense. This is not a horror film. Nothing appears. There is no justification to talk. This may be almost a TV, except for a little nudity and a bit of violence. The disposition is not very good, either. Do not make me start a dialogue. For the sudden end, the surprise, there is no one solution. I suspect it could have been worse, although I do not see how, but again, it takes less than 80 minutes, so I think this is a good thing, although it felt longer. This seems to be the short version of the movie. I found it at a very cheap price, but it still does not deserve it. If you want to make more cutting-edge charts, check out Anchor Bay edition.anyway, the version of Sleepaway Camp II: Living Camps get 1/10 of fat. If you watch this movie, you will probably be a bored and unhappy convoy. If you are a true fan, you may want to get a range of Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camps with the first three unbroken movies with special features
