I agree that although this story by Melville may be unsolvable, it is not a credible attempt. To convey the story to the twentieth century, only violates the intention of the original story and its nature; perhaps you may be able to move it to England, but the piece must be a period. Even the story of our story - the owner - tells it in the flashback, and goes back further, somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the act of disobedience will be abandoned strangely without thinking. The 20th century? Come on! Give me a break Delete an obscene word !!! Until about 1800, this behavior did not work well, given the end. The film ends? I do not know what it was, because I did not see the full falsity - I had to stop. It was like setting up "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan, England.
