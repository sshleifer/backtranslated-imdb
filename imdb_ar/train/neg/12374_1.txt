I do not remember seeing another murder / mystery film that bad. This film, which has a medical examiner investigating the death of his mysterious friend in a car accident, contains the complete receipt of a bad film: malpractice, a boring story, no suspense, a bad humor, and a lack of drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a prominent television station famous for low-budget, low-budget films like this one. Of course, TV movies do not contain the edge factor or thrill as movies from the big screen. But, this movie certainly hit all the sour tastes. The makers of this film have missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great television movie; <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Grade F
