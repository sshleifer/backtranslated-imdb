This is one of the films that has a great video box, but it contains a kami wirework and unknown actors talking in a bad conversation. It is very dark when the killings occur, you can hardly see it, and the film is hard to understand. This is Vanessa Sanchez of WCW (Tygres in WCW before she folds) and is a good actress. I like low budget movies that contain errors because they are fun to watch but Severed unourtunatly is not one of them. This movie is fine to see if you like voodoo and broken heads but this is not something new but if you need something new to watch then hire will seek.
