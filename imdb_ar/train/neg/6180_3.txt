I attended one of the first shows last night and I have the following comments: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you have taken out a lot of music videos does not make you eligible to make movies. The film had a lot of stale long shots, terrible angles and terrible lighting. Liberation has not helped this mess at all. When Dixie appears late to attend her mother's funeral, she makes her remarks, but it's never clear what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promised, but the scenario was thin and full of Ford Truck holes. We never understand what drives the characters, what is behind the conflicts that they all share with each other or exactly how they solve them. Sixteen years of distance were erased within 4 days apparently by magic. The deep talks were marred by stupid cliches. (In fact, the whole city was a great cliche of southern life.) Half of the audience suffered when Toby swirled around "Oh, I got my blood through the stitches of the veins" ... We have treated this invisible line not once, but twice! The revelation was inspired by yawning, and dramatic confessions fell back to "I was stupid and stubborn." <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was fine due to the wreckage of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and was hugging most of the film, but when he smiled and was lighter, he was charming. It's a shame that he did not have more screen time like that. Kelly Preston's very rusty cut is showing. Lindsay Hoon is talented and certainly not her fault. The book made her character so impossible at first that you do not blame her father for not coming to look for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to produce more of this film, but they still seem more weary. (Indeed, their characters are lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you love Toby, you'll love the songs. But the film often felt like it had been forced onto the scene so they could show one of his songs - or artists - on the poster. For example, the official love song for the film is "Crash Here Tonight". You think this will play around a tender love scene, but both ... we hear about 45 seconds of it as it heads towards a memorial service. It was as if they were saying "Well, we should use this song somewhere." The song "Broken" is annoying and the best thing comes out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In short ... a never-promising conspiracy has never developed completely and the film is grossly unequal as it tries to be a vehicle for Toby Keith's music and products for Ford trucks. It's about people rebuilding broken bridges to try to be around the power of music but the story is so bad that both points are lost in this oversized music video. I loved Toby and I really liked the "Broken Bridges" but the people who relied on them in producing this film have let him down and deserve one of his famous shoes.
