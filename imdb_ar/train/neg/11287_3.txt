This is the film that he had a lot to live in. In the year of its release, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I heard nothing but bad things about it, especially a plot criticized for being too complicated. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the plot is a red herring and the film suffers more when using the word "Plot" because as far as I can see that there is no plot as such. There is something involving Russian gangsters, a character called Beth Thompson, trying to carry his wife Sarah, and an Irish flavor called Shawn. How they all fit into something called "conspiracy" I'm not sure. It's hard to explain Jay Ritchie's schemes, but if you see any of his films, I'm sure we all agree that they all have one, no matter how complicated they are at first sight. Similarly James Bond film though sprawled conspiracies with motion scenes. You will have a serious problem believing that the RANCID ALUMINUM has any sort of central layout that can be convincingly interpreted. <br /> <br /> A look at the list of actors will ring enough warning bells for the type of movie you will be watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films that have been produced in the past 15 years, and she does nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives a bad representation (and plays a character called Kant which summarizes the intelligence of this film) while a supporting character is shown by a presenter because no serious actress will be seen dead in this <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say For this film is that it can be completely forgotten. I saw this a few days ago, and immediately after watching, I was going to write a very long critical review warning people not to let them see it, but now I basically forgot the reason. But this does not change the fact that I remember disliking this piece of stupidity
