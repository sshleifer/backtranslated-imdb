Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it's not an exciting story? There is no hint of any intentional humor, but on a few occasions, poor people who act, misdirection and the apocalyptic scenario have made the audience laugh out loud in the cinema. This plot is acceptable - a promising young artist culminating in the death of a murderer who walks by mistake. The murderer sees the collection of works of young artists he holds and decides to attend an exhibition of his works. At the show, the killer meets the sister of the dead artists and ends up in love. All these things are very predictable and the end will not end anyone's guess because they are very poorly scripted. The film is mainly directed in and around Vienna, and shows the beautiful city. Do not waste your time in this movie unless you are taught how not to act or direct or write a movie!
