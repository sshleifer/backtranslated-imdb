I really can not believe this movie is not in the IMDB 250 worst, it is very terrible. When I first saw her, I remember talking about it in a classroom and was seen by two other people. The other members of the class told us not to see him because he was so terrible. By the time we finished, others wanted to see him just because they did not believe that anything was as bad as we were saying. Do not be like them, just pass this by. I am sure that all the participants in this film also prefer not to see them in this film.
