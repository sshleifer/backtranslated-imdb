Everything you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks great, has a strong original soundtrack that reflects the late 1960s, and all of its characters except two people are not desirable. Once you get this message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> The hero of Davis' story ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then by the time he takes his advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fictional film - the imaginary director - does so by pushing her aside and associating with an actress he considers ideal for the cause. The couple laughs and some thoughtful artistic direction are the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as a document of the fall of Jason Schwartzman of Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's husks were an order that must be overcome, but this is the quality of his only character. The Schwartzman family's relationship has clearly declined in this role; here in the hope of improving its options.
