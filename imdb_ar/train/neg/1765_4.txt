Well - the helicopter shots are wonderful, and the director took advantage of some of Barcelona's top attractions. Otherwise ... the production value was blown in the first few minutes, and the rest of the movie felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Bloombo was charming and fun to watch, and Abel Folk was more profound and very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He got used to the martial arts training he has and has a good personal running jogging movement. The rest of the wooden cast was at best, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic for Spain - it's a postcard with exciting photos and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip that.
