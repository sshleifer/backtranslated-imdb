Warner Bros. made many trailers in the 1930s, most of them fast-paced, economical and very enjoyable. I really like how the studio utilized the least glamorous elements in our daily lives. This is one of the few sharp melodramas in Warner that do not work simply. Edward J. Robinson as the ruthless editor of the newspaper revives the 20-year story of a murder that has serious consequences. Robinson offers a vital performance but is surrounded by actors who do not cut mustard. H.B. Warner, Allen McMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad representation of Francis Starr and Anthony Busheil in the second film really hurts the film. Star is very bad during her dramatic drama near the end of the film. In addition, the moral tone of the film seems silly in the Hollywood context. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches, but he can not overcome bad behavior and inadvertently funny situations. Sol Polito's powerful camera work. Somehow, this piece of nomination won the Academy Award for Best Picture (in year we gave "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
