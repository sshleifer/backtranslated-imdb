Frankly, this movie is another film in a series of huge disappointments ... Most of these "horror masters" horror films are only terrifying in terms of their subtleties and funny story lines ... Apart from Ron Perleman, no one else in this movie To act to save their lives ... The sound of shots seemed like someone was playing the Bop-it under the arm of the lengthening or something, and seemed totally unrealistic ... In general, this movie is scary just like home alone ... the only good masters They are "Burns", "Jennifer" and maybe "Pilates" ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have destroyed this kind that used to some M already on his understanding ...
