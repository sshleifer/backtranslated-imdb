In general, this film is horrific, and should never be produced. One of the problems of this film is the lack of a link to the public and characters, for example, if it is about to be attacked, you want to feel, "Oh my God, no!" , But you do not. In this case, you do not care because there is no link to figure out. In the trailer, it looked as if the film would be great, yet there was no suspense in truth. Maybe there was some mystery but there was not. "All she has is a toolbox." It was said on the back of the DVD, you think the film was carefully planned, it is cleverly made, but it is not, the end was, just awful, very direct forward, it is useless. The representation is either average or below average, probably less. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. The "special effects" and the groups were also mediocre, nothing special at all. There is not much violence, no bloodshed, no much blood. This movie was advertised to make it look very great, but in fact, not worth looking for, I do not recommend this to anyone, unless it is easily ridden by some boring battles and story.
