I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as the Nightstalker, which dealt with Wendigo's legend, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. Man I was wrong. The whole film creates this sense of events that are about to happen and that will be scary and frightening, but then offers a very simplified story of revenge and murder for the loss of some property. E Scary - No! This film is similar to Cold Creek Manor, the other loser. <br /> <br /> It's hard and hard to believe anything Hollywood poses about scary films, because they seldom come with anything original and scary anymore. What idiots pay for such a fake film to be? Go back to the children of the drawing board, and do a good job with the millions of dollars you have to get rid of.
