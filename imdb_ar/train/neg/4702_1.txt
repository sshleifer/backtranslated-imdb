I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about it. It's very annoying and stupid. Everyone says that Nat and Wolf are heroes in the music world and they will make it big. What type of medication do you take ??? !!!?!?!?!?! Both nat and alex will either end up in the end or end up like Jane Hudson of "What Happened to Baby Jane?". I could not reach more than 20 minutes of this time, barely 30 seconds from the show, and managed to survive for about half an hour from Battle of the Difference. How can anyone cheer those guys at the ceremony at the Children's Choice Awards, I have no idea. A few days before the premiere of the film on Nick, most teen actresses appeared on Nick (Jimmy Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsay Shaw, etc.) in a commercial show that affects children who died in the brain about the magnificence of Nat and Wolf. First, they did not fool me, first of all, perhaps nat and alex anesthetized them or paid large sums of money to say that and convince him, because I do not see how anyone can find this show / amusing movie. The music is just awful. Nat singing looks like a moose, and death dies on the crack. Alex is the most disturbing character of the film / television ever. He's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird, he thinks he's hot and knows all about girls. This guy is lucky if he manages to get laid. You know that this show is fake when you discover that some characters (in real life) do not exist !! Jesse's character was actually played by Nat Spy and Alex's cousin (they must face a budget problem). Their father is not alone, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the show, which makes it seem that Wolf is less than my mother. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Ali DiMico. I will tell you, the nude brothers will be in the depths of ** when their "admirers" discover that everything is organized. 0/10
