A very boring drama starring Roddy MacDoll the little, who trains the brutal horse, Fleca of the title, the only reason to watch the film in the first place. This film is one of the endless films that bring you to the point of severe headaches, and is encased in loud and sad music and is laden with schmaltzy dialogue. The sequel to Naffly, "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka", where McDouall trains the next generation of nag, marginally better than the original but the pace is still slow and the result continues to put you down to submission, although there are one or two scenes that do not Stimulate the coma.
