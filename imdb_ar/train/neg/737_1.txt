WOW! <br /> <br /> I received this movie from a friend of mine, I bought it for 1.98 in Walmart, and felt it got it! It transcends boring, where most scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, and the representation is somewhat improvised, as if they did not have a script. The Martians are CGI, which looks as if they were done by a beginner, or a film produced by Fan. I can not confirm how damaging this DVD is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one scene, Mars is torturing a local prisoner. Moves from a woman in front of a green screen to a copy of the CGI. The change is very noticeable, and when you kill, you can see it's computer personality, looks like something from a game dating back to 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like Plague! You can download two clips from their site, and find out how wonderful God is!
