The film "Flight Of Fury" is a very difficult film but worse than all the boring action films - I do not expect much from Seagal, all I expect is to be moderately amused for 90 minutes or more with some reckless actions - unfortunately this does not happen until This low expectation, the motion scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is irrelevant in these films) unnecessarily complex and confusing with huge plot holes throughout, the work is very sad - bordering with embarrassing Seagal and performing his single whisper expression is the best among many The third lucky ones - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12 million has been spent on this Terrible mess unless $ 11 million of that salary 12 Sehgal - I doubt it one way or another! One moment of no interest for straight boys or gay girls is that it is apparently not clear what the two hot chickens in the lesbian sex scene of the complete types with huge baps are otherwise shown - they are mediocre things that do not differ For many of Michael Dudikoff B-Movies you have endured <br /> <br /> 1/10
