Back is one of those films for that specialized group of people who love the movies they carry and confuse them at the same time. Play Sarah Michelle Gillard a lame businesswoman who does not kill vampires or ever scratch throughout the film. I was willing to tolerate this, yet I was not willing to endure the worst liberation ever along with past memories useless. In the end it turned out that she hit her car when she was small. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a backlash. With this film, it is impossible to find out. Can you believe the same dude who made the army of darkness produce this nonsense? A much better idea is to stay home and watch the Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. This movie contains everything: sluts, zombies and dude with chainsaw for arm. The forgotten did not even have one of these things.
