This 2003 TV movie was shown on a women's channel, naturally. As a man, why am I even trying to watch this? I do not know, but I have to test my head. Director and writer Simon Gournick should be ashamed of himself to give men unfairly as he does. It takes away any power and condemnation that a man can have through the presence of many eminent women in doing. The first figure is Joyce Hisser as a wife. I could not wait to drop it. Her revenge was silly, stupid and very confusing during most of the film. The other Mrs. Fetel was Nicole Hiltz, the coldest person she wanted to meet. Its manifestations did not justify our leading man to go to this monkey and her behavior was very clear, no one could make mistakes. Definitely a loser. Timby Locke was good, but she was slow to absorb the slut that seduced her husband, and played again as a loser, by David Deloys. By shedding light on our losing team, Anthony Denison as president did not have much to do but give up our hero. Steven Jenkins as our hero, or should say the victim, was not good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but I trusted him later. Never got the part away from the ground and it was repeated all the time. Although, as a man, I became angry when the two women fled. Men, watch out for this channel that hinders men and women escape even from killing. LMN is the channel. Beware. Note: After seeing this second time by mistake, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially for the writer / director Simon Gornik. I still think it has insulted the male species and should have a horse's skin. Only the recitation of grace in this film is Tempe Locke who has no chance to show her talents through the terrible representation of Jenkins, Heizer, Heltz and Delwis around her. In addition to the stupid conspiracy that makes it worse. Gornick and his stars fall in it. Please LMN does not show these vulgar again.
