Once there was a director named James. We have brought wonderful, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Alien. These films were the things from which the films were made, and he looked forward to a wonderful future for him, as the dawn of the computer had brought special effects on the film industry. Presentation Terminator 2 gave us a glimpse of what was possible in this new age. <br /> <br /> ....... And then happened ................ ... 1997 ........ Awards are not counted nor Counting .......... obscene amounts of money ... ... ... ... and a strange shower of publicity ...... ... ... maximum profit margin .... .... it was Titanic here! <br /> <br /> I've never (ever) been one to jump on a cart and be very important in order to actually, I've often taken the opposite position of the majority just to get a constant argument. However, Titanic was a film that I got only one positive film from Kate Winslett which was absolutely fantastic all the time! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was like something outside of Beverly Hills 90210, the representation was more than was the house of my nephew's tree, the images that were terrorized, in fact a comedy (a man falling from the ship and bumping into a fan), a false history (I did not start until I started because there was so much), he had objective music (there with the bodyguard for the cheese) and the stale love story was so boring, so self-indulgent and pathetic that it did not respect the plight of anyone else I was happy When he died and disappointed when he did not). <br /> <br /> It is clear from the word go that this image was designed to attract MTV and watch the creeping mobs and chase down teenage boys and girls (DeCaprio is something less heroic than the weed member of the boy band) who run their sex - their hungry boyfriends out for a half-second Hour chick hoping to get luck later! The worst side is that they did not stop at this point. Millions of idiots of feminist culture have gone to see this massive waste of celluloid because "the cost of production must be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good they knew their films." <br /> <br /> The glory of the coronation came when Titanic swept the paintings at the Oscars. King James Hollywood had a moment of solemn silence for the victims of the deadly evening on which a three-and-a-half-hour farce was based. It seemed to me as if he were praying for forgiveness after he made an inaccurate fortune depicting the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid and emotional enough to buy in this kind of garbage, they deserve to be separated. Good luck to Hollywood if this is what they want to make money, I will do it if I have these opportunities in life! <br /> <br /> She's on the worst movies list ever. Other silly, historically false / human interest such as "Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
