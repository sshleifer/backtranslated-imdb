I love the novels of Jane Austen. I love books, movies, Pride, Prejudice, Sensation and Sensation, and I'm halfway across Mansfield Park. But I could not bear Emma. I left the book after two seasons, and by the end of the film I did not care much about Emma. It does not seem to change at all. He may have been acting at Turquoise (which was excellent in the film Sahin) or not interested in the film. Dono. <br /> <br /> The costumes were wonderful, but the dance was maddening compared to Bryan Pride and prejudiced by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ahl. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 essentially for the fact that Knightley is a bloody great, and although he performed fairly imperfectly for Ioan McGregor, I loved his singing.
