This movie is a great step down from the typical fare designed by Bollywood. The presentations were awful. So Iranian Bowman, who is always able to shine, goes completely to the villain. The soundtrack is also memorable. Despite serious attempts, the female can not be "exciting". Vivek Oberoi is able to execute much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar fare at the moment. But this monster is even under his limited abilities as an actor. Isha Deol and Amrita Rao are appalling in poorly written clich√© roles. It's time for Indra Kumar to hang his steering hat. I hope not to draw another drop like that. The future of Indian films is in better hands now. In short, stay away from celluloid waste.
