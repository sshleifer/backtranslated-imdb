Almost, this film looks poor and lacks conviction, but again most people will struggle to show commitment to an uninspiring text. The dialogue does not really flow and sometimes as in this case it is less (or must be). This is also powered by strange scenes (like the Cemetry path of slow motion) that you think might lead to somewhere but it seems to waste a few extra seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange mix of comedy bands / positions that I'm sure sounded a good idea at that time, but if there's any situation for someone who needs to be honest with the screenwriter, there's here. But he seems to have one character who always plays, so I began to wonder if he had just been given text or filmed and ordered to interact as usual. <br /> <br /> Finally - the humor of this reminds me of the Python (I think) quote about Shakespeare, about his "comedy films" - if he meant that he was humorous he would have put a joke in it. Well, I have not seen anyone. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did it because I was watching it with a friend and I still hope it gets better. <br /> <br /> It did not happen.
