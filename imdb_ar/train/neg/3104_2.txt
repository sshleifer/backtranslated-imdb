I have done a good number of reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I have not seen the whole movie. It was so stupid and funny that I could not sit in it - although I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in this film and any film by Mel Brooks I call "the bear". In other words, the better your film, the fewer you see in the movie. Think about it - the producers and young people Frankenstein had wonderful films and barely had. But movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of mel, which are beautiful movies (yes, I do not like Space balls - but that's not the place to talk about). Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think of a less ridiculous subject of homelessness. This is just a comic strip. Think about it, people. FUNNIEST (?) Scene in the film has a tendency to make a lobby with Leslie Ann Warren in the trash game !! This is funny in any way?
