This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad behavior, bad script, everything is bad. Comparing it to two other films of the same kind and almost simultaneously is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better, and seem to be more powerful in both story and direction and Albert Pune is still managing these two! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, perhaps because of an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval conditions. There is a special breed of robots (cyborgs) living on human blood and there is a story ... cyborgs needs to get a lot of humans to achieve the "prophecy" there and humans need someone to prevent them. One girl with a robot (Chris Christoferson) was set up by the creator of Cyborgs by Destiny to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries some of the elegant fighting scenes in Hong Kong with participants flying high and jumping away. The movie failed miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film for the sole reason that most people will get a new movie "Worst Ever" related to it. For fans of this genre, I recommend "Cyborg" because I think it's a very underrated film with a high entertainment factor. If you can not stand by Van Damme, see "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
