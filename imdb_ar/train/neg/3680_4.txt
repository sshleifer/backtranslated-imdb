I remember one day, on the morning of June 18, 2002, exactly. I was startled, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when he heard the sound of a terrible explosion. I went to the kitchen where I saw several neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem and saw a column of smoke rising from a distant place, followed by a smoke scene a minute after the sirens sounded. I remember rushing into my bedroom, taking out the binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and fixing a broken glass bus image. The bus was still near the capture station, where a terrorist and a single click on TNT killed 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of my close friend sat me in the bus in the back row, an apparently arbitrary decision that made no sense and saved her life. <br /> <br /> I am sure that every Israeli with at least one terrorism has relevant memories he wishes she would never be and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about her. As it turned out, the film was about to become a self-contained memory. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the writing of a play on the dry run, Haim Buzaglo (pictured, Hmmm, Haim Bouzglo, who also wrote and directed the film), who spends the best part of his day conducting contests staring at the blank word processor page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decided to talk about a former army officer. Buzaglo, boredom and a little paranoia because of what is medically known as "what on earth this hot girl dating me," asks the special eye to perform the test on his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As the detective progresses in his investigations, his observations in the play and later, into the lives of their representatives. In the meantime, the play turned from comedy to an indictment against the deviation of Israeli society. For the film, well, the film becomes an exercise in liberation frenzy, hidden in crumpled cardboard letters and unreliable dialog boxes as it drifts miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard characters" I refer to the characters that were under the obsession of the writer / director of the movie "Meaningful", they were devoid of any real dialogues and any credible mood. I will not explain much about it. Suffice it to say that I am sure that homeless male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. To see a play, that is. <br /> <br /> This film, according to Haim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of the current trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be drawn from experiences such as those I wrote about at the beginning of my review, rather than the isolated world of personalities that exist, but only a plan that is no less convincing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter movie. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a sign of austerity. Filmed in ten days, all actors were working free and the full cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, not overlooked zero or two or twelve thousand dollars). It makes you wonder why it took 34,000 dollars to complete Blair's witch project.
