When talking about large groups of actors and actors around J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, this is usually not mentioned. Maybe because the output of nine joint ventures between the two runs a whole series of really good entertainment to the average. Unfortunately Kinjite: banned topics fall in the latter. <br /> <br /> This is sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But for my life, I do not understand why it was necessary to make up the father of the lost Japanese girl, a man who used to get some cheap candy because the romance in his marriage had run out. This was probably good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here. <br /> <br /> A clear police drama with Charles Brunson as a policeman we saw so much in his line of action and who has a strong bias against the East. This part can also be used as a little explanation as well. But he will have to overcome them if he and his patient partner Perry Lopez will determine the place of a captured Japanese girl. <br /> <br /> Brunson's time in the team's team told him exactly where he was looking for the kidnap. Jaime Fernandez's handsome and elegant leader is the man and Brunson has some history. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat an expensive Rolex watch and set fire to his car. <br /> <br /> At some point, Fernandez encountered the discovery of Brunson and Lopez at a popular restaurant all night and this after having a Rolex snack, sprinkled the place with Uzi killing everyone, but Brunson and Lopez. I really think that this simple incident would have seen more than two Los Angeles police officers after Fernandez. But this is another terribly big hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> Fernandez still has very harsh justice in the end. I wish the whole movie was the best. This was the last film by Brunson Thompson and the latest film by Lee Thompson. He had to come up with something better.
