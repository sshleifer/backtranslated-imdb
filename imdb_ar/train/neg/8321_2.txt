Hayden Christenson and Jessica Alba, two of my favorite actors of the century, seem to be collaborating in what seems to be the hottest attempt to reshape the effect of the butterfly that has already hit him. Waking up is very dull and not quite interested so you are better off sleeping. Terrence Howard is still recovering from the evil ghost Auguste Rush is fighting a gracious battle like the sadistic doctor who seems intent on killing Christianson and after watching his performance, I am happy to help. <br /> <br /> Alba, I'm still recovering after the Fantastic Four high silver server. Is of course disastrous and unpalatable as it has always been. Only once were they ever so ingenious in the faithful hands of the principal manager Robert Rodriguez in the city of Seine. Jessica Alba could not be poor from the actress she most likes and perhaps her acting abilities are reduced by poor text writing. If so, it will be clear. What with a script that would be ashamed of Plan 9 of outer space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson, and Terence Howard star in the first film director / filmmaker Juppe Harold teasing nervous about a man who suffers from a frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic awareness", which remains the ones On the operating table are fully aware of what is going on around them despite staying completely paralyzed and unable to yell for help. When a successful young man (Christenson) passes under the knife and realizes that the anesthesia has not fully accomplished his task, the horror begins quickly as his wife anxiously awaits (Alba) and a terrifying drama erupts in the operating room. <br /> <br /> In the hope of doing with the operating tables, as did the "final destination" of the aircraft, this first effort of the axes of Jupiter Harold revolves around the blood frost cone. The pre-appropriation sequence tells us that one out of every 700 people has a phenomenon known as "drug awareness", where the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. One of these founding members is Clayton Bearsford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), who finds himself wide awake during the heart transplant process ... and can feel every single slice. <br /> <br /> He innovates intermittently while investigating torture. Self, the awake fails to pump real horror into its novel hypothesis. Escaping from a chilling simplicity to a silly plot, it is hampered by the tortuous turns of Christensen and Jessica Alba. Would you wish I had emerged soothing before seeing? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Waking up at its very best. A film without punches that seemed undoubtedly better on paper. As a film though generally awful and very extinct. The waking failed to pump terror into its new hypothesis. The end result is really very poor. Alba and Christian are the least concerned because the main drawback of the films lies in his inability to intimidate his audience. Wake up is a movie you will probably sleep.
