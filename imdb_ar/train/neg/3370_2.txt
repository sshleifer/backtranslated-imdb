Just a stupid old movie. The first son of Stanoyak locked his foot in a really stupid way, and then her husband locked his foot in another really stupid way. In an attempt to save him, Stanwyck became unlucky, again, and faces a runaway conviction. She has a chance to kill him but fail in a very stupid way. In the end her husband is rescued, and Stanoyak tells us through the narrative of the stupid letter of the film. Everything is fine over its stupid ends. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck has ever made a leading lady in the golden-age era of a magically-oriented Hollywood; that nose is so beautiful ?? Very light? The film is very short, extending for more than an hour. It seems as though the director felt he was making foolishness, so I thought it would be better to keep foolishness short.
