This was one of the most dreadful "horror" movies I have ever seen. A child's college has an epidemic of nightmares involving the spirit of roaming in alcatraz. In an attempt to offer a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire fare in the form of a poor 1980's music video, this film is full of bad representation and a slow-moving story. Although this film is bad, often laughable (dig those boxes and terrible dialogue), it is good to have a parody in an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the honorary mention of the film as the winner of the 1987 Silver Scroll Award From the Academy of Sicence Fantasy, Fanatasy and Horror, that Devo contributes to soundtracks, or that Tony Basil has a role in the film. It is a giant disaster, although it follows a small cult (see other IMDb comments for this film).
