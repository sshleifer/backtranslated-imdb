This is a low-budget "Scream" movie. "Maddy" is a new agent in an unnamed office, where she meets and begins a relationship with her co-worker "Chris". During a hot party, Chris and his friends convinced Maddy that they belonged to the "killing club" where everyone was killed by kicking. When Maddy loses her and kills someone for a real reason, Hindex is associated. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, and there are requirements for this type and budget level (nudity, unfairness, maybe a few stars of slightly larger stars than the cast), but after the credits expire you will ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes Your life is watching it.
