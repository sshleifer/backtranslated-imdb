This film started well, I felt like I was watching a copy of Seinfeld for adults. Much, I quickly began to question the attitudes and actions of the main characters, and I could not find answers to why they did what they were doing. All the acting was fantastic but it was only a few short moments scenes where it was actually funny. Dan Cortez was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent must show this film to casting agents. Watch the first few scenes and then look for something better, otherwise you will find yourself completely lost in this mess. I found this in a box at a video store. It cost me $ 2, and due to the scarcity of this film, I felt it was a good price.
