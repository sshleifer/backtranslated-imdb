I thought this film looked like a case study on how to make a film most of the time. Since I'm a film director, I give it 2 for consistency. <br /> <br /> Problems remain from start to finish, where the plot can be largely predicted using parts and parts of most, if not all, of the previous, if not all, successful stories of the previous war. . The graphics created by the computer were very similar to watching a video game at points, and there seems to be no attempt by the director to add some quality realism to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what it was like, but I did not find that information. <br /> <br /> This project seems to have pushed the boundaries of a very low-budget film, resulting in production that draws the viewer to the side of the story without sharing their imagination. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
