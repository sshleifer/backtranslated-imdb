Strange, independent, playful, Christian Slater - all these annoyances that prompted me to look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a movie jewel. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Bo never gets the same. The film realizes itself relentlessly. I found myself incapable of suspending disbelief for a moment. Excessive, conspicuous, exaggerated, clearly dramatized, overpriced, and clearly theatrical plays - well, you'll get the idea. <br /> <br /> Icons such as a sledge hammer are not required. It's hard to feel something big for Julian Bo because we do not know much about him. Funny people, annoying city dwellers, stupid dudes, and noisy kids - why would anyone, especially anyone with a long ambition of life to reach the beach (Personal Slater), decide to stay in this miserable place?
