Such a cast is rarely wasted very badly. Griffin Dunn, Rosanna Arquette, Eliana Douglas, Ethan Hawk, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walker, and John Tortoro all jumped into a movie line that seemed nothing more than Hollywood in jokes. Martin Scorsese's name may have been associated with this draw, but the end result is far less than the sum of its parts. Like a nightmare gone terribly wrong, each scene seems more contrived than the next. "Search and destroy" is nothing more than mere abstract nonsense, elegant and tolerant with self, the entire film is certainly boring .......... MERK
