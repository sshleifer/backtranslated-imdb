Perhaps Smother's viewing was the longest 90-minute period of my life. There was no laughter. In fact, I do not remember ever cracking a smile. Diane Keaton was horribly anonymous as a smoker smoking mid-aged dogs, a schoolteacher's mother figure, a relentless unruly woman clearly suffering from a kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, complicit, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and, worse, boring. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long series of cinematic cliches - the socially impotent close relatives who try to break into the "industry", the bad guys and the long suffering, but the still-loved father, the moderate wife who still can not "take it anymore" The end goes beyond the discord and comes to the house), a herd of non-tight dogs that you like to chew throw cushions while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br /> Whose snore I was never a fan of Diane Keaton and did not remember me Smother Only exaggeration does not matter how many pictures you made in your first life <br /> <br /> While I love Dax Shepard and sometimes I can tolerate Liv Tyler, their performance was so bland that it was clear that None of the actors took a look at this film, it was fine, because it was not inevitable that I and K. Keaton had confused myself and endless, and sometimes Shepherd's hatred seemed real. Slap it myself. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
