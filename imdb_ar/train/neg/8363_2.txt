I gave it 2 instead of 1 because I think the Wild Women in Wango is worse. This exercise is patient. It's like brushing your teeth by a dentist. There is no conspiracy. There is no logic. Certainly there is no representation (although the shark has some good dialogue). We do not wonder about anything. We do not know how people got to where they came from. It's always amazing to me how things like this are launched. I agree with the former writer that it is not bad. I know. It is about 90 minutes long and will fill a large area on the DVD set. It's like paperweight. Or a bad painting I bought at the sale of starving artists. Covers the crack in the wall.
