A family with Abby Lewis (Del Medkave), her mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Elaine (Blaise Birdal, and about 3 years of Gage (Micho Hughes) go to this beautiful house in Maine - For the half-end that runs down the highway in front of their home every 90 seconds or so! The neighbors across the road (Fred Fred Gwyn) make them feel at home ... and show them a pet cemetery where the children bury their pets. Is a sacred land that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead return in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "Cindy's spoiled ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was a long time ago but it developed characters and attitudes that made you care about what happened. This film abandons every personal development and plays a role in violence and murder. Kill the animals on the camera (I know it's fake but still disgusting); a small boy hit by a semi-casket pops open during the funeral (in a completely sick scene) and he comes back to life and attacks and kills people including his mother 3-year-old child of her suspension); ghost jogger (do not ask) try to help the family without reason ... The film only works to attract all death or horrific violence to your face. It's just a way out of shock for you. ** Terminating the vandals ** <br /> <br /> Acting is not useful. Midkiff is just as horrible as the father - he's handsome and screws but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwyn alone saves this image through good acting effort. <br /> <br /> This image shows complete disdain for the public as it takes great leaps in logic and leads characters to incredibly dumb things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film (inexplicably) was a huge net hit in 1989, which led to a worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in one of the plays at the time and was disturbed by how the audience kept the cheers of violence and was amazed at what I saw . . Horror horror movie sick. Song 1 along the way. <br /> <br /> When you think it's over and can not get worse, Ramon sings a song title !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Really incredible.
