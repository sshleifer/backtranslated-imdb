This is a decent endeavor, but it seems that the person who wrote the script in the dark seems a bit exactly what makes the zombie movie wonderful. No, it's not CGI errors and software companies. In fact, I'm not sure if it's a software company - I've seen it without translation, so I had to guess what they're talking about. Anyway my point - instead of wasting your time in activating some stupid mistakes, why not throw more zombies and more actions. 2/3 of 20 minutes consist of newsletters, bugs, and some men screaming for something. To make matters worse (more boring) most deaths occur outside the screen. I realize this is very common for non-budgeted films, but then there were some impressive effects (well, the kind that made me wonder why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - it's short, No one cares anyway.
