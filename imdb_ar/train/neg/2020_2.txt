This sounds like two films: one is a long, slow, long story about an AC player captured by the parts he plays; the other is a gorgeous social commentary on a middle-aged divorce taken by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another job on the side. She receives strong hints about the need for communication, her massage certificate and her desire to enter the fashion show. I love a glimpse of her apartment planted with a small kitchen behind a curtain, and her terrible decorating wearing a football shirt that reveals the navel, puff. We know they are the Oscars for impersonating impotent characters, wearing lots of prostheses, or pretending to be crazy. The sights of Shakespeare (which go to ON) are embarrassing and dated. As well as "crazy" scenes where Tony seems distracted while listening to his voice. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not an aristocrat. He made it clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy. When he moves his father's advice, he slips into Cocney's tone.
