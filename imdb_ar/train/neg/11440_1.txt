Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - I mean it at all. My wife and I were bored of our minds within 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, that's unbelievable. Women (non-lesbian) do not fit together - and do not accept "by mistake". The brothers and sisters do not live together in their thirties running in a swing as they dance together and share feet in the central park. Men do not discover their wife and sister accepted romantic the night before the wedding, and then never discussed with the wife mentioned. Very silly. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham may be the worst actress in the movies today. You smile when you cry and vice versa. The only movie that was ever good is Boogie Nights - this is because it was not acting. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about how bad this film is.
