After leaving the famous television "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts gave movie stars a brave experience with a series of stunning and fun comedy cars. Unfortunately, the film "The Reluctant Astronaut," which was filmed cheaply (as was most of the Knotts movies), is much worse than his other films. Playing without a small town schnook who got accepted into the astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate to travel in space - they want him a new concierge! Some may say that poor satire benefits from American fever, which was then new to the new age of technology, but the click is just a grim excuse to keep children restless. This starts with a good start, through good preparation and nostalgic sites, but it becomes spiritless and stupid. * from ****
