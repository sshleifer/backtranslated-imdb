Horrible ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I have seen some very bad pictures, over the years. Sound also absorbs image quality, direction, representation, etc., etc. The only good buds (meaning funny, because they are too bad) are special effects. Overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughter. The rest of the flick gives you brain damage.
