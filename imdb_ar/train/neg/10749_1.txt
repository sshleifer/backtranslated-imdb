Maybe it was the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that jumped at me immediately: 1. The forest was like hills in Los Angeles with trees and brush. Not scary at all. Breaking News If you shoot in the Southern California area, the Big Bear is only one hour away. They already have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. The writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I have ever seen. Each line was possible in non-original film or clich√© or just plain stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "Camp Blood" (Lame), and the name of the clown is "Killer Clown" (Lame). What does a clown do in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. Another but certainly had less representation. Definitely the worst group of actors and actresses ever combined. The hypothetical abundance of slender and misrepresented lines. The worst of it is that when Flash comes back again randomly to this fat foreign girl who has become naked to take a picture of her. It's a really long scene and I think it was supposed to be exciting, but it was not. This was also one of the few interesting parts of the film for me, and it was supposed to be a "mathematical tool." For example when bored in the film, catch some rocks and start curls with them. Then later supposed to be going to run into the clown is obviously immediately with his "like the girl" Gretchen, it is far from sports. O girl who played Kat, oh good Lord stopped singing. That song she sang for credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie for some reason, I recommend at least seeing the special features. A series of novels that made this film speak of it as if it were the original story. In fact, one girl actually says she has allowed some of her friends to read the script and neither can predict the outcome. She seems to be hanging around with special kids.
