... The child actors were annoying. It also seems as if the filmmakers were struggling to fill in 90 minutes. Scenes of decent death, though. If not for the scenes of death, this film will have a very Disney feel of it. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist of the child was not nearly as scared. If you are in the middle of the forest with someone of the ghost-killer fairy-tooth type, you can bet your ass that I will not be wandering around and riding my bike. <br /> <br /> In general, I've seen what's worse (i.e. he's waiting), but I can not see him again, or advise anyone who bothers you unless you're a horror collector.
