I hate how this movie does not contain any creative input. I know they are going to realism, but frankly, I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I'll live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle low production values, hell I sucker for low production values, but at least I work in some good ideas. The trend goes just to the point of grabbing the camcorder and wandering a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig it up because it makes things more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama was basically life with boring bits. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not by a long shot. Rosetta is walking somewhere, Rosita is working in a bakery, Rosita is eating a pie, Rosetta is carrying distant bags, Rosita is walking home, and Rosita is walking somewhere ... It's not amusing. There is really no deeper meaning either. I was very bored and began to look for some ideas about life in this film, but it is just a clear reality, and the most exaggerated quality of work. I think I'm supposed to love this, but come on, there's nothing there.
