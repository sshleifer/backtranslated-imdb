Rich Detez Joan Winfield (Mikast Det Betis Davis) is engaged to marry the stupid selfishness Alan Price (Jack Carson seems lost). Her father (Eugene Pallet) is determined to stop the marriage and was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Kenny. They bump into the ground in the desert and hate each other but (sighs) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to get a high rating from reviewers here just because Kenny and Davis are there. They were great actors but they were known for drama rather than comedy and this film shows why! The text is very bad - there is no real laughter in the entire film. Joke Running In this Cagney and Davis have been falling first in the cactus (this is done three times!). Only their great talent saves them from total humiliation. They do everything they can with the lousy materials. Kane tries his best with his lines and Davis screams every line of full power but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" looks at his face throughout the entire film (perhaps because the emotions of his characters change in seconds). The palette only with its distinctive voice and above the upper readings gets the few smiles. But, in general, it was boring and not laughing - it's a real routine to sit on. This gets only two stars for Cagney and Davis and some fine film works but in fact - it's not worth watching. Kane and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why.
