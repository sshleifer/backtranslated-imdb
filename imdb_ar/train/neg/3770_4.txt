The intention of director Warren Pittie to convert the famous Chester Gold tape into live animation (with Betty himself in the lead as the box-jawed reporter) had sweet displays of innocent nostalgia - very unusual and interesting coming from Warren Betty. Unfortunately, the picture required pork, fun for a moment but finally tired. Dick Tracy tries to drop the mob Big Boy Caprice, with the loving help of Tess Trueheart, but his evils have staggered Mahoney. In the first half of an hour or so, the Oscar-winning artistic direction and specific design are great to absorb, but as the plot continues in a predictable manner (with no real bite to write), things start to get distracted. Al Pacino got her surprise nomination for Oscar as a wicked boy Caprice, and Madonna (often used as a costume supporter) sings to Stephen Soundheim "Sooner or later", which won the Best Original Song Award. Lots of heart, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to seeing him - but the picture is wonderful and delicate. It lacks heat. * 1/2 of ****
