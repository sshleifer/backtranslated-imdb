The subject seems very dated today. The TV was adapted from the book Rona Jaffe. We trek and trip through a fantasy. Four university students participate in a live version of the Maze and Dragon board game (based on fortified towers and dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters a very deep fantasy world. His fellow players have to save him and save him from the harm he is doing. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Croson and Chris Macpis outperform the quartet. The support team consists of veteran representatives such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it seems like reckless. But what he sees most is watching Tom Hanks between the days of Bosom Buddies and his big power on SPLASH on the silver screen. The smaller scenes will get more fun.
