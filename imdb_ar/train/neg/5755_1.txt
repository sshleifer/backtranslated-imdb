I watched this film at the High Falls Film Festival in New York, and I have to say I found it full. Although it was funny in some places, the real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to talk about and that acting in some places was awful and scary, especially "beautiful lady" and the voice of the narrator (who I was. He had much to be desired. I felt that the GCM is the unique feature of this film, the real movement and the gravel and (outside the film) the only real actor. I'm sure there is another team and it has tight control over the output, it could have been a decent movie. Let's hope they are not sent in a generic version, or if you really want a copy, look in the Deal box at Lidl.
