I've seen it. A couple of laughs, but nothing writes about the house. Jason looked to me like he was enjoying himself. The long muzzle roller (DVD) consists of almost uncontrollable bouts of laughter. Salma Blair seemed to be digging the clock, but again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" I think? Jim Brolin was amazingly funny. (Being married to babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Steele's father (joyously), in 10 things I hate about you is funny here as well. It's wonderful, but the best aspect of this film is the selection of Julia Steeles. I spent two hours watching her folding laundry and I felt I did.
