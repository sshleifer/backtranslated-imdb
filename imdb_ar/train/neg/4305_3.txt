I've watched this movie for a while on a CD-ROM. <br /> <br /> I will first mention good points. <br /> <br /> The movie, at first, tries to at least appear to be unbiased, such as not showing one character in black and the other in white. Both are friendly and live well in a country that does not prosper at the same time. Their families come together, take part in concerts and practice their favorite sport, rifle shooting, as comrades who are not competitors. <br /> <br /> But 15 minutes into the game, the plot has entered a crossroads. The audience is expected to believe that for an unknown reason, these friends should hate each other. For an unknown reason, Bosnia is now on its way to conflict. Sure, the script adds to television footage where characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the tracks are from 1993 to 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> History, the 1990 elections, did not mention the people who caused the war. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who was a presidential candidate and leader of the second largest party in the Bosnian parliament (SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the Social Democratic Party had to take office in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party took full control and held a separate referendum in March declaring itself a law in Bosnia and declaring secession. <br /> <br /> The history of IDAP in Muslim Bosnia begins with Ali Izetbegovic, a suspiciously absent man from "STtH". He was a Nazi student in World War II. He even wrote his book "Mein Kampf," in which he said: "In fact, there can be no peace or coexistence between the" Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions. <br /> <br /> In 1990, the IDAP elections for the "pro-Yugoslav moderates" lost the thought of Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Serbian Christians during the civil war, who treated his supporters like brothers. Abedic was prevented from seizing power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election but took power. <br /> <br /> Events from above are missing from the film, but they are the real events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were problems in the props as well. The Serbian soldiers in the film were wearing World War II helmets they did not use. The soldier also carried a M-1944 WW2 rifle used only by the USSR, not by Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and scriptwriter had a chance, but they chose to rewrite history.
