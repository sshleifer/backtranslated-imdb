First some background. I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have visited many games at The Den and most of the other London clubs. I am familiar with the type of person who is involved in the rioters and I know how they behave and how they talk. I have to say that this is a bad and bad film. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie rocking embarrassed. I felt I had to write a small review because I felt I needed to point out some things. <br /> <br /> a) People do not speak this way in London in real life; filmmakers took the whole vernacular away and made it seem stupid. Unfortunately, there are troublemakers, but those you see on Green Street are like parodies. B) The actor who plays the role of Beth Dunham (Charley Honnam) has unfortunately sounded like an "English" or "Cockney" like Osama bin Laden. It's from the north in Newcastle and I'm totally surprised that any other representatives can keep their straight faces acting with him - how we are supposed to take him seriously. Why they did not get someone from East London to play this part is beyond me. I could have done an "exciting job" myself. C) Mr. Frodo. I mean how can I expect to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking ass people twice his size and who are really hooligans. It will be dead. So easy. Frankly (as British) it was hard to watch this film. I'm sure this movie will bomb here in the UK. It may be a little better in the US because Americans do not know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist but they are all underground and crush silence, on a much smaller scale. The film gets only 2 of me because they have already filmed part of it in London. They usually try to photograph these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect all of us not to notice it.
