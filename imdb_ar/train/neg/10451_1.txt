I'm fed up with all these little things that talk about how this movie shook. It's pure CG over-their-Crap! Do not send a murderer, it is reasonable to smuggle hundreds of bright, aggressive, poisonous snakes on board a plane! The only reason why people like this movie is because they feel that they have to. This is not "very bad, it's good", it's very bad, so it's better to be smeared with a sharp stick and then subject to it again. I honestly thought it would be a comedy like a plane! Parody! I was wrong. All this "suck, get it!" Or Samuel A. Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand It seems that a bunch of superstitions gave the film industry more money to make more films like Triple X and Die Hard if you spend the money to watch a movie with the same people They bought a CD of William Hung, still living in the mothers' basement, producing a plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing games online and looking at porn, then rushing to the theater and ask for one ticket (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) To hell with films like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance and 12 Monk eys and Clerks etc. No irony in watching good movies, the real degradation of Western civilization, this film is described as an insult cult to real cult classics like Repo Man, or even Orgazmo, I've said enough here.
