With Knightly and O'Tool as promoters, this movie had good possibilities, and with McCallum as a bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away in a ridiculous evening, and later with the remnants of the Modlin war. Of course, of course, it was a beautiful English country, superficial and flat, or not. The first mistake was dumping on "Knightley" early in the film, when it was possible to play the role of someone aged several years instead of choosing someone over ten years of playing by. They missed all the chances of a big showdown between the cast, and instead, they pulled out the stupid, easy, low-cost elements.
