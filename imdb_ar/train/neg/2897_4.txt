There is not much to admire about Dan in Real Life. First, the full setup is incredibly intriguing. Did you really think that during that first long conversation in the restaurant, Mary had not told Dan where to go? Since Dan did all the talking during that conversation, why should she be attracted to her? For this, I did not understand why Mary was attracted to Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince him that he is a really good man (for example, he lied to Mary at the bookstore, his brother mocks his ex-girlfriends and tries to tempt Mary from "blind history"). There is more competition like this funny scene in the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making the whole family. Yes such can really happen. Dan in real life slow pace and na√Øve. Even chick clicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher scores than the predictable "tearjerker".
