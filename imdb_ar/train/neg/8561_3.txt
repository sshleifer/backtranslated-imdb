Cowboys can leave you a small sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of the best Jones movies. Do not get me wrong. With any move by John Wayne, there are always some good places. This one has a fair share. But the whole picture moves slowly and does not live up to the expectations it could have. Bruce Dern is once again doing a great job like a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the film. The kids in the film were average but could be better. This will be a good film for filmgoers aged 8 to 15 years. <br /> <br /> This will be a good family step to see with your children. Just be aware, there are a few scenes you might want to take a look at before letting the kids see it. But most of the children I know have seen the film. Maybe that's because they see children of their age and do all the work.
