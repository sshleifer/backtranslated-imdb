I purchased a DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version he saw broadcast on TV. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was poor to nonexistent and full scenes were raised. In one case, Adele is placed on the bed, and soon we break into another scene - coming in the middle of the sentence - where she will be the next night. No characters like Grace Poole and Mason were ever presented, making one wonder if he had been stopped for a few minutes during the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw with Platinum Disc Corp was produced and even at $ 6.32, it was a guinea pig. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you buy! We send this again.
