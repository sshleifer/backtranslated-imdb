Well, admittedly I'm an Orthodox woman living in Borough Park, I'll be a bit biased against this film. However, the goal of Boaz Yakin seems to be the only one in the production of this film was bashing the Orthodox. With our wigs, modest clothes, and separate seats, we are a very easy target already. Yakin never make it exceed the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonya she loves him more than G-d or their parents. And then deliberately defies his father's order not to swim because of poor health. 2. Sonia is upset when her son Bryce. Why would a Hassidic woman from Monsey have a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she has not attended it before. Let us face it, even reformist Jews are holding the nation's birthdays these days. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his classes? It is supposed to satisfy the emotions of his wife in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest streets in Burro Park! 4. Sonya and Mandel should have married more than a year ago, and have just noticed that they did not mean the other? A simple idea - arranged marriage does not mean that the girl must take the first man that her father raised with her. And will not be avoided by the community if the marriage does not succeed. 5. If Sonya really wants to enter the jewelry industry so badly, you will not have to go to her corrupt smelter. There are Orthodox doctors, lawyers and teachers, and so on. Instead of controlling her life, she sat and waited for things to happen, then complained that she did not like the result. This does not stand up to one's environment; this is the leader on the stereotype. Honestly, I think they got what they deserve.
