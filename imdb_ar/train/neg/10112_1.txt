Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many amateur low-budget horror horrors that no one wants to see at all. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, many excellent and forgotten films. Zombie Nation I will forever remember as one of the most horrifying "horror" movies I have ever seen? In fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of watching it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it looks like a kind of strange dream. Have you really seen what I thought I saw? Why do police work from a warehouse? Do voodoo priests really recommend eating "zombie" burgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to watch a "good" movie, and I would not recommend it as "too bad". However, if you enjoy the possibility of watching the movie immortal perhaps more than ever before? This is for you. Now, when anyone asks me about the worst film I've ever seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think making a boring film is more than a bad crime, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that really surprises you. It's really Ed Wood-Jr. in the digital age, and I can not wait to see if he makes another movie that is as ridiculous as the movie.
