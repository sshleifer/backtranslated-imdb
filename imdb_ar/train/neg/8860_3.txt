Well, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. This is partly because it was a sexually exploiting film, and it had a lot of material uploaded (or obscured to what is invisible) to escape the controlled X rating; but the film has many other flaws. <br /> <br /> At first, the screenwriter seems to have mingled with his wolves and vampires. The villains in this film are angry and do not like silver, but in all other respects they act like vampires. Now you can not do this with a foul click of the imitator type, you have to abide by the rules of this type or the fans feel confused and upset by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the entire plot (confusing and poorly presented) is something that has already been accomplished for the vampires, but is meaningless in the film The Werewolf. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the bearded fashion is lame on you you've ever seen. Anyone in business for troubled wolves should know that fashion and lupus transformations are something that critics appreciate critically, yet some of these slow wolves are just an idiot. <br /> <br /> There are a few good little parts. I really liked the result completely. Others have been mentioned breast Siebel Daning. And ... <br /> <br /> *** ****, if there is such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also strongly liked the plan to attack the stronghold of wolves. There are a lot of horror movies that rely on characters who act stupidly, but in this case, they first acquire a very complex, effective and anti-wolf arsenal and slaughter monsters. I mean, you can kill wolves with silver bullets, and we have some powerful firearms these days. Should not be too difficult to put two and two together, they? But in a typical way, this film transcends the top and adds some other anti-lucantrop weapons.
