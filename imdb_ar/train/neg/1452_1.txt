This 1919 to 1933 Germany hardly resembles the Czech capital another World War II. Sorry, it's the Czech Capitol building in 2003, how funny it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrifying history movies in the recent past. Rom is the top of Adolf and looks damn good, Goring looks in his 40s when he was 23 years old and it seems that the "FÃ¼hrer" always looks like 56 years old. Buildings, people, and even buildings were small, sometimes. Especially 1919 many homes in Germany were almost new (World War I did not reach German cities!). Do not collapse the plaster! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There were never urban towers around this building. This may seem like a miracle to you all: in 1933, the Great Berlin Fire Brigade has a lot of motor vehicles, some even with ladders with a cylinder, but nothing with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: what kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequence? For me this was a kind of "Adventures of Adolf in Wonderland"
