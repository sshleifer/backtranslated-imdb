Let us appreciate that. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: A trivial scenario written by non-intelligent people in front of typewriters a thousand times .. The pathetic representation frustrated by the story ... OK appointment / location and a wonderful girl .. - Mail 4/10 <br> /> <br /> Social Message: The film has no social message. It's a free idea ... but if I pretend I was 10 years old, my IQ was 70 years old. I feel that the message is: do not be afraid of love? - 0/10 <br /> <br /> Objections to Objection: Nothing special, just the moderate and arrogant Jewish attitude presented by the writer / director. In general, good, nothing slims -8/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating is 4/10
