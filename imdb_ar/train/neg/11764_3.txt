I must say that I was really looking forward to watching this film and finding a new life in it that separates it from most of the very meager and professional Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trust that Sexo and Pudor y Lagrimas is the one who injects freshness and confidence into our non-existent industry. Perhaps the reason is that the soundtrack (which I listened to before watching the film) looked different from the others, perhaps because it dared to include newer faces (apart from Damien Beacher, who was always favored by Mexican filmmakers) and was supposed to have been dealt with In the inside of the script with modern social behavior, perhaps because the photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic rather than play. The film turned into a great pleasure for the crowds, and a great fall. What Serrano really deals with here is the very old Gender Battle as in All Men Sympathy and Why All Women ... etc etc etc. There is nothing new in it, and not even that, it uses a lot of common ground and cliches that make fun of them in the end without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / male situation. Full of usual entrapments to the public such as the safe gags about the cliches I talked about before (the ones that always work) and the performance of the shows (it's a good acting film in its context) .. By shouting literally. In the beginning, the most pressing characters of Monica Dion and Demjan Bechcher have come to agree with Serrano, the most pathetic figure. I do not fully agree with Serrano. They should not have been treated in this way only to act as dramatic spurs for his lesson to come ... We were keen to receive the HIS message and completely destroy its roles, which were the only solid ground on which this story stood. Anyway, it's a very fun film at times, and you'll probably have a fun time seeing it (if you accept manipulating it).
