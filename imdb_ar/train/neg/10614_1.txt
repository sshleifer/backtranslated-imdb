This is the worst film I have ever seen, and I have seen a few films. It is passed as a technical film, but it is really a piece of garbage. It is one of the best types of dance is the beautiful tango, but it can not be compensated for Sally Potter's obvious disgusting self-esteem. The plot of this film does not exist, and I guarantee you will start to laugh by the end. Especially where you start singing. It's totally unreal.
