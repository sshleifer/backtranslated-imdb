I wanted to believe in this film after the only form of mainstream comedy recognized by this country is stereotyping and stereotyping. <br /> <br /> Of course, things went quite the other way - let's be calm and light - and we went out the other side with little to show it. I bet that one of the small seeds went in this area. I know that SL did it. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have comic strips to pull. Even Danny K was the best timing. I'm really serious. Every time they present a small figure I kept thinking, "Dear, this guy should have been the leader!" <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that camera work should be terrible. Black and white did nothing for this film - in fact with such a flat dialogue, it hurt more by bringing boredom to sharp relief. Black and white also was not crisp. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. It is strange that I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this film, and its composition was wonderful - perhaps for this reason the shortcomings of this film are in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (he was more entertaining than the prospects) before he said anything) was talking to this film and not David - watched it and understood it. I bet that the men who organize Oppikoppi felt terrified. One might think that nothing happens there at all. I felt it could be photographed in someone's back garden. I know ordinary players who have funnier, more amusing and smarter conversations than any of these "storyboards". The dude they finally reached was fine though. <br /> <br /> Guess SA comedy will be in the Stone Age for a little longer. Men work cute.
