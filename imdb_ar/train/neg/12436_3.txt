The first Home Alone film was a movie that was fit enough ... The result was largely the same, in a new place. This game is trying to be original, and to some extent succeed ... Of course, the formula is the same, so it's like watching the same movie for the third time with a little changed plot. The new score is very bad (although the new "tuning the fuck" piece was, if not something else, interesting and different), especially compared to the big result of the first result, the result is pretty good, but not quite good than the second. They (almost) make up for it by using some good non-original music, but they are not the same. The plot is fairly fair and innovative for the privilege, but it is still essentially the same as the first two, with a worse and less impressive representation of "scary character turning to good". Representation is mostly ineffective. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less amusing than the old ones (they make fun of the spy stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy attacks out there, and how few of them are praised). The fact that a lot of them (and hence more traps) are just a weak attempt to try to get a top movie from the first two films ... they do not work. The idea behind the thieves and their job is a big boy ... serious and dangerous to a film for children (there was a joke or two, although this is not the first time in the series). It is also unnecessarily complex, as in general. I can follow him, but I doubt a child can. Some of the show is delivered so clearly that children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, meaning that these people have been further developed, but they have a less-than-lesser character in the first two films. All in all, not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you really love watching criminals hurt in the violence of animation. I recommend this to fans of a huge series only. 10/03
