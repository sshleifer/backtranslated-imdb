Look forward to watching this movie and seeing these great actors perform. However, I was sadly disappointed in the scenario and full outline of the story. David Duchovny, Dr. Eugene Sands, "Connie and Carla", '04, is the doctor in the story who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited a night club, was able to use his medical expertise to help an injured client, and was helped by Angelina Jolie, Claire, "Take Lives", "04", which immediately became attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kenzi", '04, plays Big Shout Gangs and a man who has all kinds of money and communication. It seems that Timothy Hutton is acting in most scenes and goes out of his mind completely in an attempt to prevent gang members from killing. Gary Dortes, "Serial Series CSI-Vegas", plays a wonderful supporting role and shoots a real COOL DUDE, the so-called Raymond Blossom bodyguard. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her sapphire red lips that attract a lot of attention from all men. This film is not the biggest, but entertaining.
