When you put your hands on a British film you expect some kind of quality. When it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This alone can bring you a pleasant and half hour. But when you look at the layers of professionalism, you will not really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and defending a liberal view of drugs, there is nothing really there. The script is modest, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of Hollywood's worst east. As far as comfort in English is concerned, it is just a shameful attempt to create another "perfect monty." Why did they make this film? I have no clue, apart from making money of course.
