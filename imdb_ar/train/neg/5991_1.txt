Ba Ba Ba boring ... ... This is next to the battlefield in the hibernation of science fiction. Jenny Francis (also known as Laura in the General Hospital) plays a small role as a reporter and in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad ... There is Ben Kingsley (Academy Award-winning actor) in this stink and a few other actors Decent. You have to wonder what made them decide to do this terrible movie. Music rises and falls dramatically as if it were an exciting story. Even if you pay attention, it is impossible to follow the plot. The effects are medium as well as already dated. All representatives speak monotonously and have no realism for their dialogue. I can continue this film. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's very bad to be funny but that's just something. Avoid it unless you want to relax in your sleep.
