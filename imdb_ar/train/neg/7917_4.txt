"Cement" is a bad film about a bad cop (Pennsylvania) with a bad attitude and bad behavior that has a bad man in a bad way reaching his cajones in a quick-drying concrete. While we wait for the cement and the film to dry to see what is going on around it, we return periodically at the right time without rhyme or reason so we can see the events leading to the cement thing. Generally unwanted flick, "cement" suffers from no story, clumsy execution, and most film mistakes everywhere; there is no reason to care. Time killer for a couch potato in need at best. (D +)
