An old intellectual talks about what art sees in films. You'll get Hitchcock, Chaplin, Bergman and some other things before the 1980s. To hide that he has no clue what's happening in cinemas these days, he casts in the "matrix." <br /> <br /> But it is not just the same art lapse speech in art again. This is reduced to outdated psychological attitudes: it is ego-ego-ego, anal phase, and sexual immorality. <br /> <br /> He is decorated with the cunning effect of editing Zizte into his films. For someone who supposedly knows a lot about films, his character is, he speaks cinematically: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words - I've seen 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen, last night or in the words of a wonderful movie maker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what I just said is one of the most insanely stupid things I've heard. At any time in your travels, the uncoordinated response was close to anything that could be considered a rational idea. Everyone in this room is now more stupid to listen to. I give you (two points) (only), and God's mercy.
