This is not only my judgmental thought in this film, but also the bulk of what he wrote about. Now do not miss me here too, I'm not totally Palestinian, I did not hate the film because it was not enough like "Police Academy 9" or anything else, I enjoy more than my fair share of the high eyebrow or identical things, I swear. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is poor, and I am genuinely puzzled as to why he seems to have received great acclaim. Long pudgy nonsense, indulged in nonsense, from start to finish, there is little that can be liked by people around the film. Some high-efficiency actors are fair enough, and none of them turn to average or worse performance. Moreover, my wife (Tom Tom Cruise Carter) tells me that it is his best professional performance ever. But the plot is not entirely tied, as it lurks between the stories of several loosely connected characters in such a snail, even when the important life-changing events are filmed, they seem useless and irrelevant, and you find yourself screaming for someone to blow up or something. . <br /> <br /> This does not help identify or sympathize easily with people (I did not think so, but I do not like most people). They all play their largely untrue stories and show the flaws of their personalities and emotions in very intricate detail and play their deep, ninth-grade relationship with many turns in their path. Yada Yada Yada. The soundtrack is also awesome, with the disturbing quality of the maroon that I thought was so unique to Alanis Morissette's music. <br /> <br /> In general, it was fun for three hours at all, and for three hours she often watched a episode of "Friends" as she intermittently showed off to a sarcastic nanny. The thing with the frogs is good though.
