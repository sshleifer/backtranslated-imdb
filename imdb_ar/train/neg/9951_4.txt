Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of some kind. Mineless fangs, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures that have nothing to do but spread their misery. Through their magic (ie, sharp tongue and fat purse, respectively), they seduce desperate souls, who go to agony and win. This is the basis of this somewhat black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine that the public is rooted with Mahal, the main character. I enjoyed, however, the voice and quick notes (and you're supposed to be very clever). I was deeply impressed by the strong representation of the actor, especially David Telles. Only Jeremy's character looked two-dimensional. Photography, music, dramatic and brutal, work well together. <br /> <br /> What really extinguishes me about "naked" (and the main reason I've never recommended it to anyone) is the way they seem to hate women again and again as a way to vent worry. In other words, in a highly absorbent world, what difference does it make if you inflict some pain on the girl, do not you? The suggestion (as some have done on this site) that Johnny is not a very strange person because he is not cruel to girls like Jeremy, seems totally ridiculous to me. Both are terrible, bad people. They are particularly keen to hurt women every time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if the bad vine suddenly swings back and sticks it in the rear. But still, his behavior and Jeremy's sadism is treated to some extent as a laughing matter. I may be wrong, but I think most people who love this movie completely find this aspect of the film a dark comedy.
