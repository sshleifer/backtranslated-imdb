This film contains some fatal flaws, and how no one can walk through the open back door to a very safe medical facility is unbelievable. Then this person walks around the facility and enters the doctor's office, it is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> A very predictable film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this film was produced, but it was filmed in Canada, and probably got a government grant. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person playing Aaron, Currie Monteth, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you're really bored and there's nothing else to watch on TV, I'll say it will kill some time, but otherwise it's a movie no actor wants in his autobiography.
