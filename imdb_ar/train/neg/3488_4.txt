Q: How does the bourgeois director deal with a subject such as immigration? Answer: by turning it into an example of existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we came back in the early 1990s, after the breakup of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent influx of immigrants in the European Union, and how best to deal with the subject by making a film about an isolated middle-class journalist, The upper class is outcasted by existence, his rich wife is isolated, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, migrants are seeking political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the border. I think in this way Angelopoulos can show some social consciousness, while dealing with the upper ecologically troubled classes. I mean frankly, the scene where a high-ranking military officer convicts his fate by sending his daughter to study in London is enough to make you vomit. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this can not be bad, Angelopoulos is the master of film art after all, right? Error. At this point, when his actions begin to shift to a highly artificial, somewhat similar image filtered in Photoshop. His usual trick: there are blurred windows, unclear lights, a strange wedding, a river walk, and people wearing yellow water coats. Mastroianni also opens new horizons for most performance during sleep at all. Really avoid. Go to his movies early.
