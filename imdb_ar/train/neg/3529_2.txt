I heard that this film was more stylistic than directed by director Jay Ritchie (lock, arrow and two barrels of smoking, Snatch) before, and the problem is that it is likely to be very stylistic. Basically, Jake Greene (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement, and in two years gambling with money from his money. He is ready to seek revenge from the casino owner who is exposed to violence and who sent Jake to jail, Dorothy Mister. De Macha (Ray Liotta). In this process, doctors told Jake that he had three days to live, dying from a rare blood disease, Oh, and Masha puts the injured men on him. The loan sharks Zack (Vincent Pasteur) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) Jake are demanding cash and doing some odd jobs for them. The film is full of Jake who tells some past memories, and during the last three days before he reaches the great revelation about Zach and Effi, and Masha, well, I think that's what it was. Starring Terence Maynard as Paul of France, Andrew Howard as Billy and Mark Strong as Streer and Francesca Anis as Lily Walker and Angela Lauren Smith in Dorin and Elana Beinisch as Rachel. These sequences include a little animation, repetition of lines twice in different perspectives, changing speeds for moments, and all these things are so disturbing and confusing, making it a silly criminal drama. Very poor!
