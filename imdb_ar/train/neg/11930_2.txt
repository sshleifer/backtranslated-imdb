The times are tough for Angel Town, where the gangs hold an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (because of embarrassing writing), the gangs want a child on the street, and Martin joins the gangs, so they beat him every day. However, given the presence of a spiritual Olympic boxer (Oliver "the greatest actor in the world" Groner) named Jack, the hope is on the way. Angel Town is one of the most incompetent messaging films I've ever made (and I've seen my share) and it seems to consist of the idea that all the gangster neighborhoods need boxers who can not work. Worst of all is that there are many embarrassing moments, it's just really hilarious. The best of the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which basically summarizes how ridiculous it is. Wit: "Do you like fighting?" (Olivier picks up his best Asian friend in trouble): I can kill him correctly, when I want him to die, and why I do not want him dead is because I'm afraid of him. I know that if I kill him, his son and wife will kill me. The reason is not dead! "<br /> <br /> Of course, it is wrong to kill someone, not to mention that your best friend is of course excluded from the equation. a stranger. <br /> <br /> However, do not let me make that sound so much that I hate this film, away from it, it's terrible that it's priceless. The biggest laugh finally comes in the disastrous end that sees Groner go one by one with gang members who (the biggest logical gap in the film) refuse to use pistols. A disabled Vietnamese veterinarian also fires a machinegun at the gangs, while Gruner refunds the remaining boxes. All this expresses the sound of horrible "Mexican" accents and surrealistic energy that makes it a memorable one for movie trash lovers like this. <br /> <br /> The other is in this film, for some reason Olivier Groner never goes to college, although this is the main reason he is here in the United States and not in France to get him with his girlfriend (in a cemetery at the beginning of the embarrassing film) ) Angel Town undoubtedly fails at all imaginable levels, but if you laugh at violent martial arts movies at crazy levels of senseless movement at any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, be sure to check out the tequila, like the details of the funny opening song "No Mercy in Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * Out (bad)
