Now here the film Lou Made in Australia was easily a comedy. Sad and distressing, behold, it is thin and rich and overflowing from the land of Lala. How did the designer make a mistake? Well, basically by being so serious in a work so amazing that no one in their minds can take them seriously. Unless of course they were cliché gay single (but fairly bland) ... or is that cliché built up on cliches. No value in the story that almost seems to serve as an introduction to Jerry van Gus van St and with the title of Venus how are all this lead weight? Well, this author must have soooooo mad that he did not reach Burt and BOOGIE first because he had to make his own. Complex and uncooperative Apart from the theme of "Strange Love in the Labyrinth" left by Streisand's lyrical lyrics, we have only a brilliant story and a television show. The fourth non-essential work of this long tense drama is really terrible as the film walks like Jerez in the desert and collides there. In Oz in the late 1990s, about 20 Smethings made a similar film but in fact is hilarious called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as the VENUS factory, which also suffered a more horrifying author than Orson, they re-filmed half of it, and got a ruthless TV editor to cut it up and down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy tonight! He studied there when bad films became good through mitigation. I think that the fin is tight at launch and after seeing it does not function, I can understand why.
