What is written on the poster is: "At birth, give 6 years to live ... He is thirty-four takes the journey of life." Ami is an Israeli born in the United States and diagnosed with muscular atrophy at the age of one year. At the age of 34, after the love of the 22-year-old caregiver did not work well, he decided to come to the United States to meet a doctor who said he would only live 6 years. He wanted to make it clear to the doctor that he was still alive, and weights 39 lbs. why? Your guess is as good as me, so I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously it is brave to live when all he can move is his left left finger, but why is he so angry with the doctor about diagnosing his illness 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother that, based on medical history, people with long illness would not live long. What is the purpose of the appearance at the door of the old doctor? Why follow this old doctor in the United States is a journey of his life? There are a lot of things you might be interested in in my life: how can I make those animations with just one finger movement? How can he go through his daily life while relying entirely on others? How did he live his doctor's prediction? How to deal emotionally when others look like looking at a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything. Instead, the director got a car and set up a trip to let Ami run at the door of the old doctor to show he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
