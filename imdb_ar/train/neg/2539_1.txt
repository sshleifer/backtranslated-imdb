It must be one of the worst waste in a 35mm film ever made to the public, the sequel to an equally amusing false documentary entitled "The Legend of Buggy Creek." Dawn Wells must have been wrong, her worst behavior, etc., hoping that Gilligan would come to rescue her and return her to the island just to escape this trap of applause.
