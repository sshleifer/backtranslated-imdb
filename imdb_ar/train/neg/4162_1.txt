If you really enjoyed Resident Evil 2002, just watch it instead of giving up two hours and never going back. I can not believe that no one commented that this movie is just a cheap blow off RE. First, the "special" commando force is the unique defense of an enterprise that has a computer matrix with 3-D projection and three-dimensional imaging. This Rip "Hive" contains a series of traps that inevitably kill one member of the team at a time. There is even a reference to chess in code names, which was in the RE dialog box. Although there is no zombie, the "Rook", the enemy of the film, is a kind of vital creature, very pallid in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with lots of cyborg components just like a super mutant to a RE. So, a spurt in the finger of Mr. Richard Taylor to claim any credit in this story. <br /> <br /> They are not the same film clearly, but the writer got the idea of ​​watching Resident Evil.
