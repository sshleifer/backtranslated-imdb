This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you like this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula movies and loved everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie I said to myself, "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have become Dracula, who is he, because he is Judah. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, Jesus betrayed Christ and felt guilty after he suspended himself. You must be kidding me. This is the most stupid reason I have heard about why Dracula is evil. Who asked for some reason anyway? What a piece of sh ** this movie. Those who made this regrettable excuse for a film must be overcome. Even Dracula is terrible. If you see this movie before, you will not think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is this title supposed to impress me? Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.
