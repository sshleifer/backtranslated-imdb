Before many moons when I was seven, I could vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this film. I sensed my naive feeling of curiosity and decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. As wise adults, they told me, "Definitely not, it's a bunch of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first child on my shoulder to see an "incredible melting man". <br /> <br /> A little time passed - maybe a few days. I forgot the "amazing man's melting" and disappointment. Twenty-five years have passed before I re-entered the forefront of my thoughts. As I skipped across the channels on the digital cable, I found these long effects of a movie. My curiosity was confused and I decided to finally share this fruit that my father had denied. You must listen to them. Perhaps the "worst fusion man" is the worst known film of man. He makes films like "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated because I have wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this filthy filth. The story was incoherent and the effects were rough until 1977. How did anyone convince a film company to produce this film after me. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as you did, listen to your parents if they stop you from watching this movie. They were right.
