"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but no one wanted it. He was a little boy, but he had brains. It contains a highly intelligent script with specific characters and a fun summary. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hopper" does not provide anything of this. There is no reason to smile. If it's supposed to be a tribute to Hollywood Stonemann, it makes them look horribly lazy by providing them with scenes of badly designed combat scenes and one of the most unconvincing jumps I have ever seen. Everything seems false, filmed almost intentionally badly. Poor Sally Field was given the weakest role, with no funny or intelligent line ("If you do, I will not be here when you come back"). Bert Reynolds continues to look at the camera and wink, but the humor is on any audience sitting on the hopper. * from ****
