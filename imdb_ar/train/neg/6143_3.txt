It's really a strange film ... First, we have a former player in the US trying to turn a representative (or something), and that seems to be the only role he got (which I know anyway) - and for good reason. Although it plays a role well enough to keep some attention, it has poor performance and constant. Second, we have the worst sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the film very comical, but in such a troublesome way. Hehe Third, while our overall influential support team (including the hot chick required), the story is actually not too bad, some brilliant images; dialogue, anti-scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), the overall implementation of the weak plot. This film was hardly as good as a television movie on the Web (Fox was not so bad in 1985). It's simply a bad movie, but you can not resist watching and even enjoy it once you get used to it, especially now that you've found the perfect eternal home on TV and late at night.
