Terrible acting, bad story line, cheesy make-up, this is just the tip of the iceberg. I never saw a bad film in my life. I decided in 5 minutes to go forward and see if there was anything that could be recovered ... it did not happen. (Apart from a beautiful chest shot) it seems that the film was filmed in some furniture stores, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the collections. So you can see this red chair itself in several different "locations" if you are shooting a film at least to rent an office building and apartment, not some warehouses that will echo each of your representative's dialogue. (Note for producers) A small office space and apartment for a month much cheaper than a full warehouse, Both are more versatile and somewhat certificated) If you spend your money on renting this person, I hope you get it with a guarantee of return ... You will ask for your money ... I have just spent $ 2.99 to rent this night and feel comfortable.
