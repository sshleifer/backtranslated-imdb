The person who wrote the glowing review of this misleading project must be associated with the writer / director / star - or he is actually the same person who challenges rational thinking that this film would be attractive to anyone who is not connected to the last tightly woven inner circle. What about this? You want to make a movie - tell a story. Entertainment. Give me live characters. Sure, you can do it brilliantly without bowing to the business elements designed for a mass appeal. However, the elements of artistic expression do not address the vacuum in which the public is in constant conflict to understand the hidden narrative lines. If I have to move with a dreamy psychological thread, facilitate the purchase of the concrete fabric.
