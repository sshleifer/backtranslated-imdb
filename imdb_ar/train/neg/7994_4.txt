Pretty worthless for making a TV movie is largely followed by insect killer script. The ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near the hotel. I think it is hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ants bed. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. Watching a bunch of biting ants its victims are not too terrifying. <br /> <br /> The spoilers section The hero's stupidity is incredible. He was told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. The virus must be mysterious. After this inspector says, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys the giant ants colony. This bothers millions of ants and people are locked in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spoilers Generally, this movie is very lame. I do not understand why they got a DVD version when there are not many outstanding movies. My only guess for the DVD version is that Susan Summers is featured in the film. This is a movie to avoid.
