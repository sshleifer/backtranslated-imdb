Only the most enthusiastic DORIS DAY fan is able to find this viewer. When one thinks of a wealth of material available for a story about New York City's most obscure blackout, a film that could have dealt with many real life stories of what people had to face, this spoils the bottom of the barrel because there is no original storytelling. <br /> <br /> Once again, Doris feels discontented because she suspects she may have been bullied on the night of a power cut when she returned to her Connecticut home, took a sleeping dose and woke up in the morning. With a man doing the same, wandering around the house by mistake. <br /> <br /> No one can save this mess - not Doris, not Robert Morse, Terry Thomas, Patrick O'Neill or Lula Albright. As directed by Hy Averback, she is the weakest car she found herself in her day, committed to making the film because of her husband's machinations and unable to get out of it. so sad.
