Tashan - The title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of film actually makes a flop. What a shame that Yash Raj films produce such worthless movies from Class C. Or even some C-rated movies have a better story than Tashan. Tachan, which has been heavily promoted, has been heavily promoted and promoted with great confidence at the box office, which it certainly deserves. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, this is the worst film produced by the banner Yash Raj Films Supervisor. How did they deal with this heavy project on the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has no real sense of movement disorder? He tried to imitate Sanjay Jadvi's ways of making like Dhoom but eventually suffered. Motion scenes are more like comics or cartoons designed to exhaust audiences. <br /> <br /> The story also loses its meaning and materials to win the hearts of the masses with affection. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of South Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages ​​and vocal expressions. I'm not a fan of Saif or Akshay, but the Kareena prize should have finally gone to Saif's hand instead of Akshay. From the starting point I expected it, but in the end I was upset about the fact of the peak. Saif is the main reason for the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the middle. In any film, the final must be judged by the entire characters of the entire story, and the prize or prize must be awarded to the person who deserves the credit. Tachan loses this way, and unexpectedly failed to achieve great success. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show his comic talent here, but he still remembers his previous films. He desperately needs to create a new image for his fans that will convince them time and time again. Seif has done a wonderful job in a race, and now he is back in his hilarious nature through this film. But he developed himself fully in the field of acting. Last but not least about Carina. It looks really hot with a bikini dress which some complain because it has become very lean. But I personally do not think so. Yes slim! It is a good factor for females to attract key people (or say, males). Next to them, it is good to show the son of the sword of Ibrahim in the beginning and the last sword. I now hope that he is also leaning forward in order to make him act as his profession. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan are either mentally loved or still want to go back to childhood, or say they want to accept asylum. Excellent to the novice director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mismanaged the project by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he or she must experiment with the script and study it for at least 5 years before going into practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to make good stars in this kind of unwanted film.
