Let me start by saying that I did not see this film at first with great expectations. I recommend it to a medium-flavored friend in the movies, and MTV was pasted on the front cover so I did not expect much. What I expected was a tearful man, very playful but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, let me start by not having read the book at all. No other versions of the film were seen. <br /> <br /> It was my main grip on the film. God is wonderful. The main girl is fairly mediocre, but compared to the rest of the cast, they are Mariel Streep. The main "hero", Heath, is just awful. He can sing good songs, but that's all. His actions broke "sad" moments by being so bad at points that I burst into laughter. The Isabelle girl was very beautiful, and the brother was just a flat figure played by a representative who could not show feelings at all. When he tried, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward's role, although obviously the direction was bad because he did not even live up to what I saw him do. Oh, the father was not too bad for my memory, but he was in the film for a little while I can not remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More disintegration than you imagine. The story is predictable (until the end, which I barely understood). Characters are very monosyllabic without their true depth ... In general, not interesting or compelling, nothing we have never seen before, and nothing worth watching here. <br /> <br /> The end assumes that you are a tearjerker. He did not do anything like that. The end is not built at all, it looks like a late idea. In fact, I had to ask my friends why the end really happened, and that when they gave it to me I had to look at my face "Wait, when did they say that? Never a good sign. The editing process may have been the worst I've seen, although I understand that vanishes have taken place because this was originally set for television, but that's not really an excuse. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive young man, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this nonsense, and did not close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see the tearjerker somewhere else.
