This film failed miserably on every level. I have an idea, let's take all the participants in this film and ship them to a hot area in the Middle East. Maybe if we are lucky they will be shot all of them and will not have to waste our time by them again. Have you mentioned that I have never been bitterness about a film stack of crap in my whole life? Oh my God, I can not think of anything I saw was bad. Best watch Ishtar 25 times straight instead of sitting for 10 minutes of this unfortunate excuse for a movie. If you come across someone who is involved in this film, he will stick his face and then hit him meaninglessly. This is my two cents.
