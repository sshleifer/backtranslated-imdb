The bad plot, the bad dialogue, the bad representation, the stupid direction, the pictorial music of the disturbing porn groove that persisted over the overly textual text, and the vulgar version of VHS can not be replaced by alcohol consumption. Trust me, because I hung this turkey till the end. It was so bad everywhere that I had to imagine it was a parody of the Raptime of Springtime Class IV. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janice Joplin was the only phantom spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar but better than a thousand times, be sure to watch "Beyond the Valley of Puppies".
