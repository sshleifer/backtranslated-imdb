This is not cinema. It's not talent. It's not useful. It's not scary. It's not amusing. It's nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I got this because my cousin says "Diablo! COOL!" Yes correct. The only wonderful thing about this experience is the one fact I did not buy but hired instead. Do not wait. The soap opera at least looks professional ... sorta. this is? This seems to have been filmed by someone's video camera. It's terrible! The torturers! It sux. <br /> <br /> Filming is insulting! Who is this manager anyway? I do not care enough to look for him. It's stinky! The performances of these non-interested poor actors were far better than those they deserve. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 On the scale "B" <br /> <br /> This records about 0.3 / 10 on the scale of "A" of ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
