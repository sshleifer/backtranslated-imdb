A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME, which was incomplete but very fun (my classification 7), created this garbage around New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I love you (J'taime) creating a feeling of Paris and has been made in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current film, I did not know New York City, I did not feel like I was in my child's city. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 neighborhoods, I have not seen any scenes in The Bronx or Queens, there's one scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I've seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village Beautiful or theaters. It has great actors, most of the artists were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest degrees. <br /> <br /> The very few moments of humor are naturally sexual or insulting to many of New York's most beautiful people whom we know and love. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my thinking, I think the title should have been < br /> <br /> NEW YORK, I hate you.
