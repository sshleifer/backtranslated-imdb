Few films dissipated expectations and annoyed me as sparked by Fire. The movie is buzz trash. He does not achieve anything at the technical level. The only thing I was able to receive was the ban in India. If the reason is poor quality filmmaking instead of local debate, the ban would be more justified. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film seems unrealistic, especially when heroes begin to speak English. The director, of course, did not make the film to an Indian audience; yet it underestimated the international audience by simplifying it. Watching the nature of local help in speaking perfect English is unrealistic and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * After that we get a regular glimpse of Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come out as if they are blocking the flow of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue relates to the story. I felt that Surrealism had been lost. <br /> <br /> * The scenes of love have been cheerful and may be directed at enticing the audience rather than being a strong statement. Anyway, they do not check either of the two. <br /> <br /> * The selected names of women, Radha and Sta, are names of the Hindu gods, and thus chosen for the shock of the masses. However, since the film was not dedicated to the Indian masses in the first place, it is not supposed to be a "shock by name" choice to achieve its goal, which is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction is very poor and some of the main and sensitive scenes have been handled badly. A better director could have created a strong emotional drama outside the subject. <br /> <br /> The actor felt the wooden representation, although Nandita Das introduced some life into this role, but the others were wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not clear in this film. The male threads were outright garbage. <br /> <br /> If you love the earth and want to see more of the exit, stay away from this. Please.
