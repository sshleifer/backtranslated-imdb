PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Director: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Strobe, and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Before Three years, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her whole family by her teacher (Jonathan Shash) who was suffering a little from crushing it. She is now preparing for a high-profile concert with her hideous friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one because the murderer escaped from prison and did not bother to warn Donna because it is clear that her promise is so important that it can not be interrupted. <br /> <br /> Pros: I got some good laughs from the film because of the terrible dialogue and dumb character movements. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely obsessed (does not seem great) has escaped prison. Cause: They do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Cons: Let me start by saying that I am very impressed. I can usually have fun with bad people. I love some PG-13 horror movies. Tour (1979), one of my favorites, was originally classified PG. I also enjoy Beltergist (1982) and The Grudge (2004). So, the fact that this is a stupid, stupid film that was rated PG-13 has nothing to do with not enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I ran into a big problem with the story. I like curly movies that do not even contain stories. At least it can be amusing. It's about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so she kills her entire family. After a few years, he tries to make up for her by destroying her prom and killing all her friends ...? Then there were sub-schemas I doubt anyone would care about. Claire (Jessica Strobe) is fighting with her boyfriend, she is suffering from cramps, and I did not care about her. This should have been a lifetime feature, not a remake of the night prom. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a film with a terrible death scene. I do not care even that it is not so strange, some of my favorites (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, PROM NIGHT) were not so much, but they are still being actively killed. Here, we have half the characters die in the same hotel room off the screen, a woman stabbed several times without stab wounds, and close to the face of a bad actor screaming in agony. I am sure that the girls at the age of ten are terrified, but I am not me. <br /> <br /> The characters also hated. There was Bobby (Scott Porter) her sensitive friend from Donna, and I can almost guarantee you will not meet a sensitive friend in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had friends Donna Clare (Strobe) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the symbolic girl meant Crissy (Brian Davis). If you think the characters in DEATH PROOF are annoying, try watching this movie. Do not make me start at Rooney (Collins Penny) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me past memories of Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add to all that predictable plot, it's awesome soundtrack and a lack of great respect for the original material, and you've got quite stinky.
