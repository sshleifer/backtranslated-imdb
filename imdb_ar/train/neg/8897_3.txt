I remember when I first saw this film, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, I had heard the original Broadway recording of it and really loved it! But when I saw this, you like, what the heck ?! This movie lacks a lot of musical songs to shout it out loud! Who decided to do all that ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really impressed with Jenny Kelly, but this is probably the worst music he has ever done! The film looked more like a Hollywood group than the beautiful heights of Scotland. Who decided to release all the songs from the movie Meg?! <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they saw this film, Lerner and Lowey might have asked: "Who in the world decided to do this to master our work?" Well, they had a right to say they did, maybe they were angry at the fact that Hollywood turned their great music into this somewhat empty film. The test is in accelerated colors, but you are in a movie that lacks much text. <br /> <br /> So in short, if you want a good movie based on the music of Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
