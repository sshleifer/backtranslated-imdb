First of all, type the script on a handkerchief. Who needs more? After all, we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then get amateur reps. It would be good for the hype festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? After that, he rented a cameraman who does not know how to shine. You see, if the lighting is well lit, it will not look "real" and the festival will not like it. Who needs to shoot at the professional level anyway? He then hired a 10-year-old boy who had never carried a camera to be your employer. Your film will give a totally amateurish touch that the festival audience will miss in "reality" and ensure that although you will empty seats from real people, critics and a small segment of the over-thinking audience will shout "genius" because they will not think it was just Full Amateur Clock. <br /> <br /> Once done, buy your ticket to the Festival of Bad Movies, also known as Sundance. <br /> <br /> A sad waste.
