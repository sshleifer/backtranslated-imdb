The chosen is always risky work and I think this endeavor should be commended. There are many talents involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this movie based on three problems I encountered. <br /> <br /> First, the sections vary incredibly in terms of color and quality. Unfortunately, some of them clashed with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are several sectors that feel backward to me. Like seeds of good stories that have not borne fruit. I'm not talking about happy ends here (or even the end period), but instead, they lack the basic development or even the hard tools that entice you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York City and its inhabitants were photographed correctly. <br /> <br /> The rest you have is short HD movies that may still matter to some but will leave the ordinary viewer unhappy.
