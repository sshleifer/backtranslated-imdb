I've seen enough of all of Richard Little's interviews and performances and many poor pigeonholed pigeons in these 50s / 60s musical pics to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was just as right as David Rufin in The Temptations, but he completely failed to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Nunez, who played Little Richard in the film "Why is Fools in Love?" Was a much more appropriate choice, having acquired a strong but influential music personality. <br /> <br /> If the shows are not convincing, the film will be as well. This is what happened here. Absolute or completely lost lenses are LR invasions in homosexuality and snooping. What "The Temptations" did well in picking up the rise of the group, warts, and this film is largely missing. <br /> <br /> What happens with director Robert Townsend who started well with Hollywood Shuffle? He is a talented and funny man but he did not offer anything near this first effort.
