... bad at being intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem falls directly on the big screen MST3k. While it is clear that the film does not try to be taken seriously (hope to have their goal, anyway ...), the film is still bad. In hell, make Leprechaun In Space look great in budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: draw my muscle car in color!
