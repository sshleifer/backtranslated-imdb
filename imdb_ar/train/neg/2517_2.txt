This film is an ideal illustration of how not to produce a science fiction film. The worst trend in science fiction is to make your subject a horrifying, hilarious, abnormal and perverted "vision" of whatever the "human future" is. <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and authors), like geeks, take themselves seriously because of the high level of crap to good things of this kind. I think other species with high CTGSR (yes, I just finished, relax), such as horror, action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a slightly better understanding of the fact that they are not changing the world with some depth. Science fiction can certainly be a success at a dangerous level, as many major filmmakers have shown. But there is a huge negative side to the whole concept, represented by "Robot Jox", with its low rental construction of the "future" (the only good design element: the ads of cool billboards everywhere encourage women to have more children) In fact, I did not do so until I saw the movie as the tenth time, but I went to the school audience, so the filmmakers are not being cleared.) <br /> <br /> Of course, If you are crazy movies like me, this downside has a big side. I like movies just like this, because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes more exciting than good movies. I think it's a kind of Lester Bangs style in watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: Introduced in this film (Gary Graham? Is this his name? I refuse to go check). Not really that bad. He makes it go from him. It is a kind of calm, especially when you are drunk / suspended.
