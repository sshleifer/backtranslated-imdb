I was not quite sure what I expected from a kind of comedy, drama, science fiction and science fiction, but looking at the actors involved, I thought I would do it. I felt the tone of the film embarrassed, passing through spots of every kind, but I did not feel the balance at all, so I gave up trying in the end, focused on the cinema and individual performances, which I thought were generally good, taking into account each character was a little depth because of nature The story (will not give anything here). I must say it felt like it was longer than its 96 minute running time, and not in a good way. In the end I was looking for closures, a measure of satisfaction but did not turn into a smart piece or genius I hoped it would be. I think Tony thought wrongly that what he did at the end of the film gave us that ... But it was a tragic mistake to try to verify the validity of the previous 95 minutes with the wrong conclusion. In the end I feel cheated. IMO had better leave it standing without "finishing" as a piece of art ... just. Or ... maybe I missed this point completely :)
