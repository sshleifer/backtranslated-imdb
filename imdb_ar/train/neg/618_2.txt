Probably one of the worst teen movies I've ever seen in my life. I will start with the bad points of the film, which covers the entire film to a great extent. First of all, something no one can avoid: terrible behavior. I swear they picked up some random children outside the street based on their view. Second, BAD / non-paid character work / development. You hardly know half of the children killed here. All the figure is they deserve it one way or another. The figure of Scarecrow was exaggerated, and cheaply sliced ​​from other adult fantasy killers such as Freddie or Benhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: Scarecrow was full of horror that makes you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go to find some small animals tortured!" Really just leaves you with eyebrow lift. Last but not least: Next: BAD CASTING. How old was the man who played Leicester? Such as 30? His bald head appeared for God. There's a lot I can say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's a high school movie effort, but the point is understandable. It's just a bad film made at worst. As for what I found "good" in the film: - Enjoyment of low and low standards - will help to put insomnia in sleep. - Very cheap laugh, or even giggle.
