I have seen bad films in my time, but this really takes biscuits! Why, why was this film made? There is nothing here at all. Please put your trust in me, flick the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... it may take about 5 minutes to appear on the camera. This is the main problem. The story "based on a real story" (no matter what) can not be swallowed for 80 minutes. So we have to sit for more than an hour to see people wandering around. This is! In the first half of the whole hour, nothing happened at all, apart from seeing someone walk to a shop ... and then three men walking in the forest. Maybe this time she could have been developing personality ... but no. Thus, there is no contact people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we can not care more! In fact I finally support the Badi until the film ends! Moreover, the camera work is really awesome! This director / editor / writer / producer, Tee West is nonsense. I hate hitting a man, but in fact, his job is the pants! These blurry images continue continuously, and then the person follows people as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's intelligent, but the results are very dim and I wanted to stop the film and break my wrists! How this guy was brought to guide the next cabin fever movie is something out of me! In the end, acting is also sad, ... which goes for the film as a whole. Keep your mind safe, stick clear of this heap of total stool!
