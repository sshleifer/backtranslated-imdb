Do not let the hypothesis fool you - it was one funny film. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. The story prepares you well for an end that never comes. Worse, the setup is not explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is this?" I appreciate it 2 simply because there were short moments of promise, but the end makes you perfectly firm. Nicholas Cage did as well as he could expect in this role, but he had very little to work with. There are strange quirks, interesting turns everywhere, which have nothing to do with the film. Let this video out before you waste your money.
