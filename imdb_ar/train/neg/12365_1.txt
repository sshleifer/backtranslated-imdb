I think this piece of trash is the best proof of the possibility of destroying good ideas. Why do all American cartoonists think that kids these days want stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ??? Looney Tunes is one of the most beloved characters in history, but it was not created to be Xtreme, I mean HAYA !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how to update an old idea without losing its original charm, but this trash is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that just want to create a stupid stupid offer that kids will love it because hey !! ! Children love superheroes right ?? The whole show is nothing but a waste of time as we see the new releases of Looney Tunes but this time in a superhero form, this does not look so bad but the problem is that this demo tries to copy a series like Batman Animation Series, or New Justice League, Bad copies of Flash (Road Runner) or Superman (from another ??? Bungee Bunny) The problem is that Looney Tunes was not supposed to be exciting and was supposed to be funny! As I said before you suck this series, many people wonder why it takes anime all over the world ?? This show is trying to be dramatic and full of excitement, but this is something that some serials and animations can not do. If you want to see a good upgrade to one of the old Tiny Toons, this is an example that it is possible to bring life back to old characters, Good respect for the original roots. Too bad that the offer has already died, another wise decision for companies I suppose.
