I read somewhere that when Francis Francis refused to collect his salary, Warner Bros. responded by choosing poor projects for the rest of her contract. <br /> <br /> I decided to take the money. But her career has suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> This may explain what she was doing at Comet Over Broadway. (Although he does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter, too). "Ludicrous" is the word used by others in the plot of this film, and this is true on the target. Murder trial. Her vampire clown. Her success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No logical part leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> Also, the collections and costumes looked like B-movie elements. And her hair! Turner has been showing many, many of her films this month. See someone else and work for you.
