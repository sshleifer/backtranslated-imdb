Perhaps Potter has been encouraged by her fans to "Orlando" much better, and she offers a car for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually participates in music, including a false love song. The film is like a high school or college project carried out by a teenager convinced that her intimate love and melodramatic concerns are as wonderful for us as they are. But Potter's character is not sympathetic to the fact that the subject of her romantic obsession is undesirable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of tango. Perhaps if she had not made her own, she might have succeeded. She can not act, whether she plays herself or not. Buzz, over-ambitious, boring, and silly.
