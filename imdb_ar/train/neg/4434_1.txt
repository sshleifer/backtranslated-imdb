I rented this movie, and I think it looked like a wonderful historical piece wonderful. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This film was confusing in most locations, sporadic almost everywhere and awful at all sites. Mirra Sorfino's portrayal of a queen playing the role of a frustrated young man at best. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of the knighthood title until he considered this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw must definitely be committed to Bettonia Dorsley. At least Harry Potter films are more entertaining than this thing they call it a play inside a movie. <br /> <br /> It appears that some of the college students have studied in Cinema 101 and have failed miserably. Every scene in the film is cut almost to get some sort of effect; the end result of course is the most editing parts I have ever seen. Jay Rodan was as good as Agis. Too bad he had such a bad scenario to work with. Rachel Stirling is doing her best as a lady almost waiting in the end, I really hope that Blockbuster Video received refunds. I am very happy that I have not spent $ 10 in watching this failure in the theater. If they have been performing this Marivaux since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people have reached the age of majority during this period of work. If I were there, they would not hear the play about snoring. Thanks to God for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip boring or awful scenes. I think that means I just watched the beginning and the end!
