This movie was on a romantic channel, and I thought it might be a stupid 80 film that would be fun on some level, so I and my brother saw it. A boy did it suck. The boy's crush on the girl - correcting, * his dream * - the girl (there seems to be a difference, I am surprised because she realized she was the girl of his dreams - she was more than 30 feet in love. To be near a dream girl (creative in the sense that it is a long-term plan, but not creative in the sense that there may be the best solutions one might think), arises from embarrassing situations, a match is made (all this seems to happen in the late afternoon - Either the site was somehow responsible for this strange lighting, or the representatives had to wait until they left Their daily jobs come to the group, I suspect the latter). I did very clumsy, very pathetic. It is almost amusing * accidentally *, so there is nothing to recover. Unless she was interested in seeing Chad's first days before finally getting a piece of cake with his role as an HIV-positive homosexual in Life Goes On, or Gail O'Grady who was at NYPD Blue and probably got a stare In the buttocks Dennis Franz). But these motivations are unlikely - I say "regular confusion of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I was surprised that I saw everything. I think this is the thing you find yourself in. Halfway down, you still see it because there are some internal problems that are obsessed with self-science and you think you might end up so you can tell your friends and family that you've actually sat in this terrible movie, Some sympathize with the questionable condition of your mental health. Can you * take the challenge?
