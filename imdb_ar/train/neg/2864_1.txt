This film is very bad because it defies reality. Photography is a school material at best, and the representation is pathetic and must prevent the director from ever making films in any way. It's so bad that it can not be seen as a comedy like this thing like the showgirls. The only thing that was on the DVD going to it was the art of the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write for those of you who have never had the chance to witness this is to satisfy yourself well deserved in advance and do not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage. If you want to watch a movie about comedies, there are many other things that deserve more in this area than this trash.
