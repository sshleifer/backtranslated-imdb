(Note: I thought I would be the only one to write what I did below, but I think the others here agree with that I think it was very obvious - it was overrated by the taste of the cat.) Anyway, that's what I'm doing: ) <br /> <br /> The owners left on a two-week vacation - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) all alone and closed the house. This means no milk, but the cat, as he put it, finds a handful of canned tuna. However, because of his displeasure, he was unable to find the opening match. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house is ... and the cat catches him. This is a medium rodent that keeps Sylvester raised with the opener and then grab away in the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the tuna box but can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why they made the sad mouse "the good man" out of me. It's like some Tom and Jerry cartoons, where poor tom always gets the worst of it even though the little mouse often starts conflict!
