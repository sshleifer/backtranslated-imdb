This movie was very bad. Almost every cliche film cop exists and represents. A bad man gets away? Check. partner? Check. A foolish personal conflict with a partner? Check. Rising with something to prove? Check. The rookie shows a grizzly veteran. Check. About the only ones who did not talk to them, they shot the idiot on the feet and retired, but I think they saved those old chestnuts in the next Dooley stroll. You can add a gender battle with Girl Power along with tired old gags and extra vulgar materials like the Dooley Car Award that gets garbage all the time and you have a recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
