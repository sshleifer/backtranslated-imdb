This must be a great film ... Merrill Streep and Jack Nicholson co-authored two books in a newspaper. Mike Nichols steering. Uh uh it boring boring boring! Useless and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter, "Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy story." Now there is the original concept! After two hours of pressure (it was only two hours, I felt like six.) I was not sure whether it was a comedy, a love story, a tragedy, or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago we prefer to forget about them. I hope that the damage to the reputation of Streep et al has begun to heal and that the emulsion of the master has begun to fade. It's not a bad picture. It's just not good.
