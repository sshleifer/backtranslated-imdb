Starring Melinda / Mindy (The Return of Living Death 3) Clark as Candy, a desert resident who starts stealing a bank with her boyfriend Johnny (Jason Dor). He ends up in a prison south of the border run by Sadis Sergey Sadis (Robert Englund, who overstripped the hair). She ended up with her beloved pet in a bunker at a gas station monastery until it was converted by a newly dropped meteorite. The dogs turn into "doses" of an abhorrent queen, and Candy develops a very long language that speaks and kills a passionate lana who can not control him. Add thugs who are looking for stolen loot and other miscellaneous tricks with additional complications. <br /> <br /> First, Clarke is doing great and doing what is needed to make this movie. You see them and see the very funny people during the scenes of teasing, very convincing during scenes of horror and very sexy in many wigs and disguise, including latex wear of the eye, wear latex tight skin ... wondered how not to come this huge star actress. It is very bad that the rest of this worship attempt does not live up to its promise. <br /> <br /> The director / Scrippa blames the blame, who believes that the external hypothesis alone is enough to keep laughing ... But as a vulgar villain, annoying character support and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, as many colors and stunning collections have been muted by muddy photography and dusty desert places. Luckily for Sciamma that Clark in his film, it alone keep you watching.
