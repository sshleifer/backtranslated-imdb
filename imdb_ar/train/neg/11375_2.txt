Are you talking to me? (1987) is a very bad film starring some dude I have not seen before or since starring as a man from the neighborhood trying to become an actor. He has heavy jones for the Taxi Driver while trying to use this shtick to make it big. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what others do, changing his image! It moves from tender tenderness to dude during the night. His friend can not believe the change (but he records with Faith Ford and gets a fabulous payout). Can this little villain keep his confidence in the street while making it big? An interesting idea collapses due to poor implementation. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run because the filmmakers have flipped the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you would like to watch the movie Faith Ford Hot and the young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
