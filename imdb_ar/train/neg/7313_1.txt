I've wasted 5.75 watching this crazy movie, so I just want to know some things: <br /> <br /> What was meant by the split of the dog at half the beginning of the film, the disease had nothing to do with the split into two halves. <br /> <br /> What was meant to drag Karen into the shed, she had already hit her room, and they could have locked her there where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why does a hermit run around the forest to ask strangers to help him when he can only ask his relative, the swine lady, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why did not he? Do not bother any of the characters to walk to the city to get help when things start bad, are they all lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by a man who was carrying a rifle to peek at his wife, Paul had just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. The girl he loved deteriorates. <br /> <br /> What is the benefit of the fund? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff return to the cabin after leaving when someone else was injured, if he was too big a jerk who would leave him in the first place, could not he have just returned home? <br /> <br /> If the police encounter every problem collecting children and burning them into a hole, why did they throw Paul halfway to the river, it was not even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Whoever makes lemon juice from the river's water, these wastes have dirty leaves and bugs. Why the children could not use tap water alone, it was also polluted, so the stupid end would still work.
