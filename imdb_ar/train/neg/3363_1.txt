The original movie (dated 19 ??) did not show any "monster", it's just a scary "things" suggestion,. <br /> <br /> However, this version shows every aspect of the "ghost of the mind patient", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery", as shown in the original film, was the most frightening part: one simply did not know why strange things had happened. By showing the face of the "old man", this gentleman disappeared completely. Worse still: special effects (crying wooden children's faces) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, very obvious to be close to as scary as the original
