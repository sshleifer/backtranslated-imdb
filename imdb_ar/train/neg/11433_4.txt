The first half of this film is a pure joy. a novel. Funny. Great deals. A brother and sister knit document living in Manhattan for the same woman! grown ups. bright. witty. What more can you ask. This romantic comedy starts refreshing. Heading to an unexplored area. And then it collapses. <br /> <br /> It moves from being an international adult comedy to an old-fashioned story that has been performed many times before. What a disappointment. Movie sponsor begins this promise. Why should I turn into such a pedestrian "I am who I am". Highlight the snapshot of the end of the frozen window to jump Heather Graham into the air to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself" on the triviality of the latter part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up being the same old age.
