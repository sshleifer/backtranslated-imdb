I recently discovered that Madeleine Lengel's novel has been turned into a Disney TV movie and asked for DVDs. It was my favorite book when I was a kid and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Although some child actors do not resemble characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well suited, with Meg (if very beautiful) lovable in the middle and Charles Wallace who is disguised as a miracle child without anger . <br /> <br /> The first half of the hour is enough, and it does a good job of establishing relationships between leading figures and defining the scene. Unfortunately, once non-human characters emerge, adaptation starts to collapse and once the children leave the ground, everything collapses. Alvary Woodward looks very young and very luxurious like Mrs. Whimsit (think Mariam Margolis or Joan Bluetrayt instead) and Kate Nigelan's face is a very similar and unappealing mask and she must have visited the plastic surgeon at Faye Donaway in recent years . For some reason, they made her a Glenda-like lady from The Wizard of Oz when she should have looked like a wicked witch from the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what makes this worse is the terrible special effects and direction of art. I understand that this is a television movie, but the CGI seemed like something that could have been done 15 years ago. Ms. Watsour's Avatar in Centaur is a disaster like the Chewbacca suit for Aunt Beast, which in the novel is a velvety creature rather than the big, interesting thing about the big foot shown here. I can continue to work, almost every technical option is a disaster, because it is assumed that there was not enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacked imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> This would really need to feel the wonder Spielberg brought to his early movies. It is a shame that under the current popularity of adapting the children's literary fiction series, no one has considered adapting A Wrinkle in Time, which is a complement to the big screen, giving it the range it deserves.
