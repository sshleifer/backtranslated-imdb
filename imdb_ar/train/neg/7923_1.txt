I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original Corpse Grinders is the main reason, but this is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Even the brilliant gloss of the legendary Renay Liz ("Desperate Life") could not save the useless piece of trash. This movie should be a lesson for all filmmakers in the past, present and future. When you have a successful movie like the original Corpse Grinders, you probably have to leave sleeping dogs lying and you should definitely not try to activate them after more than 20 years. (Unless you have financial support to pull a sequel superior like Herschel Gordon Lewis with "Blood Feast 2: All U can eat") even if you decide to do so, it is likely to spend a little more money than you originally did and for God ... Never shoot a movie on video ... Why filmmakers try to do it when everyone knows that quality will become prohibitive ... I am a person If you can not make a better sequel than the original movie, sell the movie rights to someone who can ... and what Ted V Mikels (or Smoking) When this scripted God wrote wful? I mean Come on, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A cardboard box coated to look like a destructive machine capable of grinding human bodies ... bones, clothes and everything? If any of these actors, along with Liz Renay, have been paid more than five dollars for their miserable performance more than was paid them badly! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original text instead.
