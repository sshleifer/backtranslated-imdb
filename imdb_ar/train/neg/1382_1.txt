The film was awful. The theater died silently because everyone was embarrassed to have such a garbage. I think someone gave Jet Li a delicate operation and made him implement a text of dialogue written by a five-year-old boy. The martial arts are "good", but when placed next to Jackie Chan's films and "The Matrix", it's best for you to see one of those movies.
