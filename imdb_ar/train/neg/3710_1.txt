The king died, live the king! Caddy Shack Two, The Family Under the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills were linked to the worst film ever in a long time, until they started their own icons. But there is a new king ..... Yes ..... all the new king cold .... "To the ground." But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are very bad and they are good. One day, this film may come out as a "Rocky Horror Show of Pictures" that is not as a movie of worship. So go see this .... this .... well, take my words for it. Go see it. All the new king Hail!
