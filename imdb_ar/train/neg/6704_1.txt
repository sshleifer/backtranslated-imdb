This is just an awful "comedy" - it's a really bad film. There are no funny items. No funny jokes. I do not know how some people can claim that this dreary short film can be "smarter" or "quality." Maybe if it's the only movie someone has seen, you can ask his brothers. But I've seen thousands of best films: Leonard Part VI (now, that's funny)! I do not know how the brothers are qualified to be included in the Internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Knock aside, skip this movie. Root canal is more fun that these unfamiliar articles vulgar cliche.
