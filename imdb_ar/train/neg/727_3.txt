I was really shocked because a great director like Chuck Jones started making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons. I did not laugh once throughout this short time, a cartoon of Bugs Bunny, for Christ! Bunny Bugs Cartoon is always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, it turns out that this short film is Good Night Elmer (an incredibly boring Jones movie) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning signal from a pale caricature is not always fruitful. Good Night Elmer was boring because he kept the same two cups forever with a predictable reward. These cartoons, on the other hand, are infected with the second cautionary note of boring animation: there is a lot of dialogue. At least two animations exist in animations, but most appear to be longer than thanks to the massive padding of dialogue. At some point, Elmer ends up having dinner, and comments: "This was wwewwy wegwwe weg well from wamb", and perhaps the most-needed dialogue I have heard in a cartoon (characters reading the text aloud in Woody Woodpecker comics later) does not count In my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it seems like 20 thanks to frequent dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun game for me, but if you sold your spirit to Chuck Jones and could not admit that he had a few claws during his career, you might enjoy it.
