"What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if by asking this question, they were somehow relieved of what would happen in the end. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" try to get their snooping laugh while disguising their instincts as a kind of responsible social experimentation. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he will overturn his life. Then, with the quickest guidance and guidance, they allowed him to leave by way of fun. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money does not buy you happiness?" "Homeless homeless because they deserve to be?" Or what about it, "Raise the man up - it's more fun to see him fall from a higher altitude." They took a man who had nothing to lose, and gave him something to lose, and then they watched him get rid of all that. Is this supposed to be entertainment? They wear this sowing with some dark music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end has all the high moral grounds for the videos that crash the car - this time they designed a car that crashed and asked, "What happens when you stop at a signal stop?"
