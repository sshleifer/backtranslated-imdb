A pathetic attempt to use science to justify the age / philosophy of the new age. They have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just a clear mistake. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports ideas in Eastern religions that reality is illusion. What? Well, in a world without atomic, you can never predict the location of particles at a specific time. You can only give chances of it happening accurately in one place at a time. Also, it seems that the act of observation affects the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this, so far, is accurate. But they say that means that if you believe faithfully enough that you can walk across the wall, you can do it. This is a full poppycock. Instead, the theory asserts that it is possible, at our level, to walk through the wall, but it is just a coincidence and has nothing to do with faith. You must continue to walk to the wall so that you will always have the opportunity to pass through the wall. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how. Distortion of science. But the most disturbing thing is the narrative, which includes a miserable photographer, played by Marley Maitlan. Almost halfway, it becomes so confusing that it can not be understood. Something has to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth in that, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is the new hot thing in physics these days. Instead of wasting your time with this dredging, I suggest you hire The Elegant Universe, an amazing series prepared for NOVA on PBS giving you a history in physics from Newton and the attraction to Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 episodes of 3 hours. Quantum Mechanics explained there well if you want to know it without mist metaphysical credits.
