There is no denying that Azumi's first film was a commercial product; it was adaptable to a common manga with young and attractive actors and certainly not available in the budget section. However, it is more than just fun for what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" lacks everything that made the original version very fascinating. The first thing that should ring the alarm bells is the absence of the wonderful player Ryuhei Kitamura on his head. With him, he seemed to not only take his visual taste and movement, but his original style and beauty and most importantly his heart. While the first has a simple plot, "a distinctive list", this group has a clutter of a story, with too many boring characters stabbing each other in the back often eliminating the possibility of any sympathy or blades. Gone are the effective interaction between leading personalities. Azumi and her companions are often turned into a group of troubled teenagers who argue in a forest. Profile does not exist. If anyone who is already watching cares about who lives and dies, they will be shocked. The same goes for the bad guys here. The final battle - in fact all battles - is completely free of any kind of tension. The fact that they are poorly designed and poorly directed - let alone few and far apart - is very important because they do not find them. The villains themselves try to be in a very difficult camp, and even if they are all integrated, they do not fall within the country of Pete Burnsian originally from Jo Odagiri. <br /> <br /> ## # The leading spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Otto tries to do all she can, and she keeps her hair in good condition. Azumi is now a complete killer, meaning they can be waved in a slow motion; unfortunately, now the personal is implanted with a kind of mystery style man without a name, Ueto model seems more appropriate. I know this is supposed to be the point, but this along with the ineffectiveness of anyone else in the film, the stupid plot and general incompetence of the film in general means that it is impossible to give up her character this time. To say the least about Chiaki "Remember me from Kill Bill" Kuriyama was performing better; suffice it to say that "turning" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> In general, this was just a huge disappointment. Any advantages are done ten times better in the first film. The mess is lazy, unsatisfactory - and generally boring.
