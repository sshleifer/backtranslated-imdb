"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to be happening in a world free of hoppers, a long time ago, the biggest sin a child can commit to challenging the law and getting a ticket. He opens up with a young fanatic woman in cars who gets to work from her arch rival, whom she presses in the race car. This is about the drag race - this B-flick is mostly about rock and roll! It is clear that people at American International were fond of the young educators who loved the concert but did not mind receiving an adult. There are a couple of double entrances and mutual fruits (Necking Kid: "We thought we would go out for some fresh air" ... Dad: "Where do you think you'll find it, down her throat?"), But the ghost is a little late in reach. In short, in 65 minutes, the film fools us into a climactic race that actually takes place outside the screen and "Scooby Doo" before being senselessly revealed. However, nostalgic amateurs, some reckless fun. ** from ****
