It is easy to see why Scary Movie makers have found it difficult to imitate the irony of these adolescent teenagers' films. It is incredibly equivalent. If Valentine had been released a year or so ago, I'm sure they would have cheated this movie too - and if they find any genuine original material to distinguish it from Screams, I know what I did last summer, Urban Myths. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new for this genre, except for a better ending than usual which, of course, leaves little room for an inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychic assassin hunts a bunch of beautiful young women, and kills friends of the main character, one by one, and typically. Lots of T & A's on display, no evolution of characters, bad representation, and excessive bloodshed. <br /> <br /> The thing I can not stand up to about this type of film is that it turns out to be "Who did it?". The thing is that they are not because the motive is not detected until the murderer is revealed, and tells the main character who is the one who has killed all the friends. Usually it was not at all clear during the film anyway (for example, a partner kicked the father of a personal uncle's main dog and his friend's father). Everyone is still alive throughout the film is "suspect", but they are "red herring" more suspects. As we all know at this stage, the main character runs an unreasonable escape and kills the unconscious psychic murderer after revealing the motive. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost until the letter. ***************spoiler!!!!!! (Mini spoiler anyway) *************** On Valentine's Day, the motive was not detected, but I left you the opportunity to think about the light that the movie did not completely end in the usual 'cutting style' Teen. The problem has been solved only partially, and the main killer's target may have been achieved or not achieved through bloodshed and almost everyone killed. Does the killer want more, or are the demons really defeated? <br /> <br /> This still has not made Valentine a good film, instead, I've kept it from being as bad as usual, which is still unimportant to many. For anyone thinking of making another movie on these lines, please do not do it. Originality is very important, and it is hard to see any originality of this kind.
