Was this movie stupid? Yeah. Is this the depth of the film? Both. Personal development? Both. Knitted tricks? Both. This was just a film about Springer's very imaginative show. Shows how long some people will go to get their cups on the TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jamie Pressley. Jaime is .... well ... awesome! I did not make this click to be a "great" movie; it was meant to live in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and not like us in this film) where everyone sleeps with everyone. Moreover, all the girls become pregnant by different young people, The girls are riding in a pick-up Ford 66 (the exaggeration, of course, but this is the picture everyone sees when they remember "trailer park"). Some people exaggerate in analyzing movies (eg Star Trek's Fools). I just watch movies for entertainment; do not point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the "Goofs" part about a kony shirt, would it be better to be better?
