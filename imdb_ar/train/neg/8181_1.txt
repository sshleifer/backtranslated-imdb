I went to see this film (actually I went to see the family photos, which contained "Moments Cut" + two other shorts for Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I could not see it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of the cutting moments and take a peek every time from time to time. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt the light. I left the cinema a few minutes after the start of the second short session (BTW, I was not the only one who left the room). WAAAAY was violent and disgusting to me! I admire a lot of brave people who really liked it. I just do not understand how you can love this kind of movies! The horrible, bloody and terrible images I've seen are really stuck in my head for two days !! I also try to analyze the story (my friend saw it all and told me) and I do not think that makes sense. I mean, the amount of violence and things, makes no sense but to try to shock people. This is not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this film that I can say "well, it was something" x "at least well". But well, I think I will never understand this type of film at all.
