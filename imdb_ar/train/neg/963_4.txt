"Opportunities" is a big mistake in his vision. You can know the director Emile Ardolino from "Dirty Dancing" and "Sister" and you should expect something amusing from him. But I think I should disappoint you. I made a very bad film indeed. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies again as a baby. Growing up Robert Downey Jr., Junior returns to his former hometown where he meets his former daughter Mary Stuart Masterson (complex, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then shows the former junior wife, Cybill Sheppard, and Junior is also in love with her. I think it is not necessary to mention that she likes Ryan O'Neill. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr became the worst. He copied Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> Shepherd 'Moonlighting' has proved to be inappropriate for acting in films. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is one thing that can be used for this unusual comedy: as an antidote to insomnia.
