All I can say is, before watching the film, I had no indication of who was Anemary Schwarzenbach or what was her life story ... I must admit that the film was barely helping to access this data .. and even failed to convince me to conduct some research Writing some words on the google website; however, all I can say is that actress Janet Hain was a wonderful expression of the dumb face she played well and showed a severe mental state of depression, as it is in fact. <br /> <br /> The scenario that happened in Turkey, Tehran and Afghanistan. But believe me, I know the region. It was all about an Arab desert in Morocco. The Turkish and Farsi people are completely different in face and culture in the language that is not Arab. <br /> <br /> I suppose to make a film like this documentary - a comprehensive search of all these secondary elements is mandatory ..
