Good idea, badly implemented. While this may sum up 99% of the SciFi movie, it really applies here. I love movies that are slowly revealed about a good story, I love motion movies, and I love all the major actors, so it could have been wonderful. However, despite good acting, this film failed because of ill-written Bill Platt and directing it. <br /> <br /> Another review has shown the good point of needing to know where you are going so you can get there. This film does not. It has been compiled in a random way so that you know that the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is absolutely unnecessary and can be removed without anyone's notice. This scene begins and ends as he drives a car, so you can cut from one car to another and do not miss the meaningless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film has also been a strange habit: under some explaining details while explaining others, so much so that you can guess the whole "chart" in advance. She also usually had an early abortion fight, perhaps just because they could not afford it. There are also a few bad and funny scenes where a "plot" is detected on a computer and a final battle involving a "toxic substance" is placed in a dangerous place (* * * *?). <br /> <br /> A lover of Cherie Appleby, watched this movie because it was fine. She has managed to get out of her "Roswell" character several times and made the chick very difficult (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has done since restarting Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was rated 4/10.
