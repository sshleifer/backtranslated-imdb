There will be a time when the children grow up without seeing anyone at all and Bugs Bunny only accepts (technically) another man on the lips. There will be a time when there will be no duck or rabbit season. There will be a time when the name of the Tasmanian devil is called politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But, help me now is not this time. <br /> <br /> No one really wants an "extreme" version of our beloved Loony characters. Whatever the marketing that comes with "Corn Nuts: Corn Goes Wrong" and "Dortius Xtreme", it is obvious that this fecal feces should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or anything does not mean they know Jack the kids. <br /> <br /> I think they are hurting children, which deprives them of one of the biggest and most famous shows of all time. This offer disgusts me, and it is not just a dated artwork or a terrible dialogue. They misuse good vocal talent, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and many others. It lacks elegance, humor, personal development and most importantly is the heart. <br /> <br /> The exhibition, like recharged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner and Ace Bunny) is nothing but a shadow of the former, immortal beautiful self.
