I never like to comment on a good film, but when it comes to a bad film, I have to be very concerned about it. Speaking of Vivah, it seems that this man, Suraj Badjatya, has completely lost. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, I think he is able to make money with his wedding videos. Vivah was so cheesy that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind them. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment in the film where I can say "Oh, at least this is good." Anoth plays a clich√© in the role of the girl's father, Shahid Kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhid, Amrita Rao is another disaster. The ugly spoiler, bad fashion, a sketchy story, a brutal father's wife, hard-acting actors, sensational background music, cheap soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Now the spoiler warns you guys that this is happening in all his other films, After the movie ends a catastrophic occurrence in a happy note.
