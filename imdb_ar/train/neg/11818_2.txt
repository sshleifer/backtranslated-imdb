On a remote planet the mentally ill is saved from execution by a space monk. Some of his fellow prisoners are released and out of prison in a spaceship. It is anchored on a massive spacecraft orbiting a supernova star. This huge craft is home to only three people, and it is assumed that the film's budget did not include the hiring of many actors. Anyway, in order to shorten a long story, it ends up with three goodies in the cat and mouse game with the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The psychopath of this film suffers from the strangeness of being annoying. The term "annoying" is not a term used to describe the word "crazy", "scary", "scary" or "dangerous" perhaps, but not "annoying" but "annoying". The three people who run the giant ship are not seriously convinced as they call such important roles - this ship is about the size of the city! Given that the film will be screened in approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a massive man-made vehicle exists, regardless of the fact that it is used for such a mundane task. Despite the large size of the space ship, all the crew are horribly linked, and small rooms and a dining room consist of what seems to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are lots of lanes. <br /> <br /> The film is good to act and acts as a medium-sized scientific sensation. But nothing great.
