Every now and then you hear DJs calling the listeners to screen the movies that the listener can not stand or watch all the time. This is the movie I'm thinking about ... days later. <br /> <br /> It's Shakespeare's play. I'm not sure, but I think I saved this film after about 20 minutes of weird ... I think I realized that my toenails would not cut themselves, and they were looking at me aggressively for a cut. <br /> <br /> This film seemed boring and ambitious to me. <br /> <br /> Although this is my first low-grade movie (which you've already tried to watch), you want to make you out of other films by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" was a great British film, although its content was sometimes mixed with a wonderful film, but I can understand why people refused to see it. <br /> <br /> Another good film directed by Greenway was "Z and Two Hymns". Again, he had some content that pushed the limits of good taste, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> The other film I usually think of late on these radio shows is "Brazil". Never seen it all the way through sleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for self-important films, which are characterized by a very sophisticated style, characterized by strenuous steps and difficult to follow, and clear guidance from Procero's books.
