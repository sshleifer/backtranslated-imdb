I wanted to see an exciting comedy with a satirical twist (as this movie was tamed) but this film failed me miserably. To me, the plot was a bit confusing, and soon lost interest. I feel very sorry for John Cusack, Joan Kozak, Ben Kingsley, Marissa Tommy and Hilary Dove for their participation in this film. I will remain a fan of all of them, but only time can heal my feelings for this. The only thing I can say positive about the film is that Hillary played the role of the Unica character so well that I did not even know Hillary. It took me a few scenes to realize it was. Luckily, I rented it for $ 1 through the Red Box; if I paid to see it on the big screen, I would really smoke !!
