I have seen about four other Japanese horror movies and they have not been impressive. However, I felt that there was a reasonable text to guide the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. This is about the mabahith who is trying to link the similar murders that occur. When the suspect finds a question, the suspect is afraid because they continue to see the ghosts. Then, the stealth begins to follow the detective about a good reason not explained and addresses more than half of the film. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? The film does not keep switching views to different characters unrelated to the story. I've seen this before in other films where a different perspective emerges. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Also, everything that happens on the screen is actually readily accepted. For example, there are a few scenes with a simple musical score that accumulate and ... then move on to another scene. I realize that this can have a big impact. This is definitely not the intention here. It's just a bad adjustment. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a "ghost" who screams in a way that is not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and happens a lot throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the horror has been performed by in better ways so you can watch them all come. Then after one of them, the film ended. At that point, a flurry of viewers was overwhelmed by the feeling that we all felt we had lost our time. Someone made a fake applause and followed that laugh. It was better than the whole film. Simply, avoid.
