I can happily enjoy the guilt of a flick, but that's just bad. Not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of them. It's very bad as if you can not find anything to enjoy it no matter how hard you try. I really regret wasting two hours of decent life on this nonsense. You can tell by watching him that he did not ask anyone to act and that everyone knows that this film will bury their professional lives only. It seems that the "tall walk" earned enough income and one decided to invest in it. If it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad it scans the worst movies of my memory.
