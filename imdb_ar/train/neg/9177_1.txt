"The House of the Dead" was the worst film I ever saw, between square attempts at the corner of the camera, "Matrix" 360, and the cheese starved by drowsiness. I do not think the manager and the designated manager can decide whether the sky is raining or not, because there will be rain on one side of the boat and not on the other side. I would like to rate this movie 1 out of 10, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also jumping on scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, which makes you wonder if they are compensating the lost time. I beg anyone reading this, not to see it. Not worth the time.
