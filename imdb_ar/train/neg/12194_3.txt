The film begins with a voice telling the audience where it is and who the characters are. This is the moment when the film began to hate. With all the endless possibilities for any cinematic director at hand, I find it very easy and cheap to solve the situation by voice telling you everything. I actually believe that audio amounts represent a betrayal of the concept of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I hate to hear a voice by saying what we are, our history, especially what people feel and think about. I think the director has to find a visual way to convey the feelings and ideas of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the poor moving introduction, a very cool film begins and continues for a fairly long time. The life of a middle class family and all individuals is described individually in an idealistic way. I think the director has the talent to capture real life situations. For example, a father who has to make his own calls from the bathroom may seem unnatural at first, but life itself leads us to some situations that may seem unnatural but also very natural. I think the director is a very good monitor of real life. <br /> <br /> But that's all. After a while, realism in the film begins to sacrifice the story. I really felt that I was having a great headache because of people who spoke nonstop. It was as if actors and actresses were given the subject and allowed to improve dialogue. It's really real, but the characters always ask "really, is that the case" and so on to each other, or the characters that say "no" or "do you listen to me", ten times when I say only once, enough to cause me You have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that theatrical scenes and the practice of reading books are more than that, they must be. I realize that the play and the book in the film are largely related to the plot, but I think the director has missed the point where he must stop showing these scenes.
