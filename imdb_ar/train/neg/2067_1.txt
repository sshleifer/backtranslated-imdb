Directly to this point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most horribly blind and candid films that have ever been produced. This "comedy" is devoid of anything remotely remotely intelligent so much that it is almost incomprehensible that it is made. I almost said because there are fans for everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bad "good" or "fun". Putting the movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" would be a crime for those films. Movies like that you can actually watch and get a kick from. But this film is very bad, very badly manufactured and filmed, incredibly bad and unbelievable, that there is not even a "camp" or "schlock" effect. <br /> <br /> Although this was done before Saturday Night Live was first shown, comparisons may be inevitable. I'm not a SNL enthusiast, but this movie is worse than the worst comic you can find. And man, this is bad. Just to prevent viewers from leaving, Shapiro throws into a pair of breasts frequently, but the bad boobs photography since 1974 will not excite anyone these days. Honestly, this film is poorly made and such a sleepy trip, and I doubt if anyone was stirred up in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made the film. I swear by God, that any 10 year old child using a video camera could have made something more entertaining and smarter. It's totally unrealistic - it's really unbelievable. The "jokes" and "gags" are so childish that young boys who like to sneak into their father's paddocks at night will not laugh. <br /> <br /> I will give this film one thing - the very last sequence, "dance man" sequence, where a young man (Shapiro) dances in the streets of New York City on tunes, is the best thing in this terrible film. This sequence of "The Dancer Man" is also wonderful - he certainly has moments of not being smart as Shapiro desperately tries to fill the time allotted to the entire song - but he was in fact fairly transparent. Part of this sequence where the policeman starts dancing with the man is the only effect of intelligence in the entire film. No wonder that Shapiro puts this sequence finally - again, although not great in itself, it easily outperforms anything else in this "film". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film is a whole piece of waste, it's incomprehensible like how a person can actually be intelligent. The name of this movie must be "Ken Shapiro Carbama". It's amazing that this has been achieved, but many truly talented filmmakers can not enter. However, I will say that I bet that the geniuses at New York University love this film. Total garbage.
