I just did not enjoy this movie. But then, I loved Babe, a pig in the city, and was spoiled by animal films that spoke very well in everything. The animals were not likable. They were all annoying especially the guinea pig Chris Rock, but then what can I expect, it's Chris Rock. I think I smiled once or twice in nice queues, but that's it.
