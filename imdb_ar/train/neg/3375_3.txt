Hello everyone, if you see "singing in the rain", you remember the scene of Jane Kelly dancing in the rain. She also remembers Donald O'Connor's dance, "Make 'em Laugh." If you see a "royal wedding", Fred Astaire will remember dancing on the ceiling. If you see "Jailhouse Rock", you will also remember the title dance number designed by The King itself. <br /> <br /> This is what we lack here. There may be some popular dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan "I can do it." Just the fact that you have some talented on stage moving together does not make a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough was responsible for this failure. He directed the camera on the stage and I think that would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Screaming at people who are testing the performance of part of Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be equally bad if he was in a Western movie or comedy. It's fine when he's in the movie Michael Douglas where we see him screaming at someone we want to scream at. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except Michael, of course. It was possible to make a good film even using the songs that were in the production stage, but one should have thought about how to photograph it. <br /> <br /> Next time, someone hopes to contact me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
