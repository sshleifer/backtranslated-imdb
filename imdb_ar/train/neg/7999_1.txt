This is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen. I surrendered to watch him an hour later and regretted that hour very much. Representation is terrible and there is hardly a conspiracy. I think one of them got into a strange shape for an animal and started making a story around it. Borrowing some ideas from films such as Resident Evil and Aliens does not produce a movie like her. If this movie is one of the best Korean films, I would rather not be interested in watching a Korean film ... <br /> <br /> By the way, these films are a good reason to believe that necessarily high degree means that the film is promising. I think every Korean who has Internet games online has rated this movie over 8, although he has no idea what's going on around him.
