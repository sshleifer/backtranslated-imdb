(1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director: NC-17 <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone's extraordinary picture, but when he read He was on drugs during filming, I did not need further clarification. "Natural Born Killers" is a dangerous and insane film, not much done; strange, psychotic, artistic images. <br /> <br /> "Killers of Natural Bornes" is basically the story of how mass murders were massively propagated by the media; there is a wonderful scene where one interviewer asks some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory. If I were a mass murderer, I would be Mickey and Mallory. " Micky describes this with the attitude of "Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that turned them into these brutal killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films study the flaws of America, the country that the director loves and admires. I think "Natural Born Killers" revolves around the impact of mass and technical media, the obsession of the nation, and the Americans (and most of the world) on things like mass murder and alien attitudes. <br /> <br /> The murderous murders of Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are performed spectacularly by two excellent actors who entered the lives of two of the striking killers. Mickey and Malory believe that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps in the harsh theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest). Mickey says in his prison interview that other species commit murder, and as human beings we violate other species and exploit an environment; the script is interesting, The size of this film, in other words, makes us think about society and human behavior, rather than the density of the blood bath we saw for two hours. The last hour of the film takes place in a heavily guarded prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the positions of the jailer etc .; filling prisons - perhaps Stone is questioning the future, and the way society leads to. <br /> <br /> Other interesting characters. First, the reporter, who runs a show about "American Fools" and is obsessed with increasing ratings, goes even further to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is a police officer Scagnetti, a crazy officer, possibly a sadist who loves Mallory - he also has some strange obsession with killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre in Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is wonderful; different colors, shadows, and styles create a sense of confusion; the most obvious green color is green, resembling the killer's disease (in a pharmacy when looking for a bell snake antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera action is crazy. Shaky, noisy, it requires some design to take advantage of it and accept it. Very unusual, numb and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Born-to-nature killers" do not charm the existence of insane murderers, but rather ask how we, the public, can reinforce this status. <br /> <br /> Although the above review looks positive Too, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the film script, was not happy with the scenario that had been changed and asked to be removed. I can see why. While it is moderately interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess for a picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
