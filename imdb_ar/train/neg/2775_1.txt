This was the worst film I have ever seen. Later. I'm not kidding. All "based on a true story / historical references", there is no excuse for such a bad behavior. It is shameful, because, as others have published, collections and costumes were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The audio track was typical "Asian" music, although I could not tell where the "talk" came when Love was lying on his bed thinking about Maria. I do not know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but it was as if Nora Jones had suddenly been moved to 1500. Scenes of the Battle of Kwik-n-EZ. <br /> <br /> But acting. Oh, very sad. Lines delivered like high bad bad toys. If Gary Stritch wore a potato costume at County 4H Fair, he might be more faithful. Near the end it looked more like a Baltic in a little Italian street. Sometimes I expected him to shout "Adrian!" Or even "Do you want a piece of me?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen says to her lover (after she is killed on the ground) "I will have a child." Responds "baby?" I expected her to return "No, wheat, leg chair! Duh."
