They, hip-hop music for a Western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and many others to track. "sistahs are in tha house" !? French manicured nails on girls hard ride. The microphone packs clearly visible on the back of Kim Li'l. I can not continue the series of mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> Acting is not the worst I have ever seen. Women performed well enough using a poor scenario. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandlor speaking in his mother tongue. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The fashion is wonderful though quite untrue. I can not believe they would be disappointed by what could have been a wonderful story. I would be insulted to believe that this film was so loaded that it would play well in the inner city. <br /> <br />
