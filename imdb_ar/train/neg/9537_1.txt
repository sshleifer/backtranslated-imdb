** The Spoilers ** I hired "Tesis" (or "thesis" in English) on the power of director Alejandro Amenabar later "The others". Based on what was wonderfully measured and frighteningly effective in this film, I assumed that his previous efforts would be of similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead, I finished the most passionate and compelling excuse for a mind-boggling film I had seen since the German movie "Anatomie" (to which one of these species reminded me). <br /> <br /> The potential was put into place within the first 20 minutes. About the student Angela (Anna Torrent - Jessica Harper), a student of innocent psychology, revolves around the subject of violence in films. In some remote circumstances, she could no longer go here. She ended up with a "sniffer" tape in which two men tortured, mutilated and killed a young girl for the camera. Angela and her friend Chima (Philly Martinez) were shocked after being fascinated by the tape and decided to get to the bottom of the charge. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never give any reason for wanting to find the girl's killers (because they refuse to contact the police during any of the current events, even when their lives are at risk). The same puzzle lurks like Graham Norton in a room full of girls the rabbit. There is only one appropriate "guide" (the type of camera detected by the killers) and that is) already weak and (b) launched in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "collapse" occurs only through blind luck, increasingly absurd plot transformations, and a series of horrible, transparent and useless red herring that are just put to just get rid of run-time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may know his stories about ghost stories but it is clear that he did not read the detective book in his life. The key to good whodunnit is to have a large group of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and gradual discovery for more evidence, before moving on to the final evolution. In "Tesis", * Possible spoiler before * The identity of the killer is correctly identified by the amateur "investigators" almost immediately, then we get 100 minutes of the writer who tries to get rid of the smell until the ideas run out, Well, I've got Ali, he's been after all "as with any kind of logic or motivation behind crimes - no such luck. You see the wrong movie if that is what you are after. <br /> <br /> The only thing that pulls "Tesis" beyond being a stupid and poorly written film is how it actually tries to make some ridiculous points about violence in movies. I have no idea what position you are trying to take on this subject, but it seems to be designed to entice a lot of misguided and misguided psychologists, and the rest of the rhetoric. "Look at me, I'm a politician!" The final scenes, where the "point" of the film is supposed to be thrown at home, is very silly and childish, and one wonders if Amenabar is embarrassed now when he sees this. If he does not, he must. This is an "amateur night in the Orient House" completely. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe that I lost two full hours (at least six hours) about this, hoping something would happen. The urban myth of "cinema movies" (that is all, in spite of the way this film tries to suggest it is a kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) Is an area that can be exploited very dramatically in good horror. Movies ("Videodrome" Anyone?) But it's very easy to skip the line to my child "do not be so great!" The area that contains them (ie "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" reaches its lowest level ever in this genre of "snuff movie". On each level, it is best to leave this dead and bury him. I'll give him one out of 10 prize, for some nice lighting, but that's all.
