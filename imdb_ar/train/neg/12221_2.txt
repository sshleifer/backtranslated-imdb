Except for the sound, none of the above represents real criticism of this kind of non-budget, independent horror film (really). The make-up effects were very good and the main actress was effective, the leading actress though attractive needed some training because she was particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is its length, in 108 minutes half an hour longer than being as effective as a pathetic film, the plot is only about ten minutes from the first 50 related. <br /> <br /> In some places, they are visually attractive and sometimes the lack of lighting in films works favorably. However, when this is combined with the weak sound as with most large sections of the film, it is difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> This could certainly be an unusual armed killer film from the dead. With some subtle and harsh adjustments, in its present form, plays like incomplete pieces.
