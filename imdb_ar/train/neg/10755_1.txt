I can not really think of any replacement features for this quite bad show on Asimov from the artistic direction. Forget the disaster of product placement, the unconvincing performance of Will Smith and the giant plot holes. This was not only funny but painful to watch. Even the work was boring. A mix of production values ​​inspired by MTV and very bad dialogue may be aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> It is still a shame that this disgrace remains scary after we get Bladerunner, Minority Report or, to a lesser degree, Dark City (by the same director). This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list. Really awful.
