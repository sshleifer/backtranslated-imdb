This film shows more racial hatred of the Jews by David Mamet than I did in an American film. The stereotypes are above the top so that my ability to continue watching is dead. I was very disappointed by Joe. <br /> <br /> Mantegna was calling a group of men, he was sitting in a Jewish center in New York cleaning the arms, heroes were common sense and stopped. I am deeply concerned that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not the healer himself.
