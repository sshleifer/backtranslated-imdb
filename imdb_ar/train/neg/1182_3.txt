This film is nothing more than a pornographic pornographic film, and that says a lot of thinking about similar crap produced in that era. This was recommended by a friend of mine as a "unique film experience". He was right. I suppose it means that it is a joke. Not disgusting, not even that shocking. Just mediocre representation and bad attempts at the art of trauma. A bit of camp value, although I do not think the makers of this film intended this. And yes, as a former reviewer said, he fucked a man in a bear suit. Do not spend too much money on this. Try borrowing it, if you should see it. Or call me, I'd be happy to sell your copy at half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to watch other films from this particular director, as he seems to have some followers. But if it's like this, I'll feel sorry again for two hours of my life gone forever.
