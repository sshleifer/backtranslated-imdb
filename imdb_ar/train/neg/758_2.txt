This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to see something good for them. They are usually educational, funny and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? Doodlebops singing number and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, and do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is this funny? No, Doodlebops says instead something is not meant to be a joke, and laughs at it. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's very bright, it's painful. As far as color, everything is very bright, so this is good. But nothing is wrong at all in the world of Doodlebop. So, they are always happy. A child will be in trouble because they have never been sad. <br /> <br /> The offer is also very cheesy. It is said that every syllable at the highest level of exaggeration and cornea too. It's an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> For children, it's fun, but after two years you will not want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow up.
