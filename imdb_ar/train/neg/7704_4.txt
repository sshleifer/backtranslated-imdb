Well, there's no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and unwarranted sex (which can be fun too sometimes, but it is not). What can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is innovative and there is a wonderful scene where two people fall from a skyscraper (one must be several miles high), but in general there is not much to recommend "Kite". Watch it if you want, but you do not miss much if you skip this one ...
