Steven Seagal appeared to be walking in a terrifying film that was almost entirely filmed to conceal a complete budget and resource shortage. To capture the technical flaws - the F / A-18s and the F-14s that you get from an airborne carrier company, and become a disguised mirage of the F-16s for the actual strike - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the film is the credit lines that fade away and disappear into the lightning scan, which is assumed to be available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your credit puts Michael Koch in the same category as Marcel Mando.
