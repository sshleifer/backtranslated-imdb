In fact, these young people were so disgusting that I could not wait for all of them to be slaughtered, including Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since she was considered more annoying to the pack. <br /> <br /> But I knew that there would be a mess of the first minutes when Kristen opened the teenage fire on the priest and nuns with Leslie Gore playing in the background. There was no place to go, but <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked fake and the "blood" seemed suspiciously similar to Hawaii Bunch, although it later took a red look one day to glide to make up the ridiculous Halloween make-up Who were all dressed. I'm sure all the GOTH aspects there will appreciate this nonsense as it will attract that group. Definitely did not like me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> Not even my favorite lover Adrian Barbou can save the horror of this stupid teenager of herself. It still looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we do not see much about her these days. <br /> <br /> However, it is a step from the horror of Dante Tomasley the Wobbly (2002) in that it is a fairly coherent plot, so I will give him a lot. The small Boston Sea called Bozer lifts it forward. I love what Bozar does for Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in a fucking film at all. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films was certainly desperate when they picked up the movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
