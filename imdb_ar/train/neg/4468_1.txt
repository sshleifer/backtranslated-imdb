Well, plain and simple, if you love other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) stay away from the legend. <br /> <br /> It is, without a doubt, the most frustrating TR game yet. It looks very nice, looks very nice, but it is fully operable and has surrendered. I feel like I was robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a computer game before anything else. You can control Lara by using the keyboard. The 6 games in Tomb Raider were standard controls. The AOD were "tacky", but still the same as the general control sequence. In Legend they changed their motion and control methods completely and can not be completely controlled. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments in other places from people who say "Use the mouse." No, why should I? Others say "use the game board". No, why should I? Others say, "But this was the standard for third-party controls for years." Well, I do not care, it's not a standard for any other TR game, so why bother with it. Oh, I know, because they were not interested in their original fan base, they wanted to take advantage of the new kids who did not hear the series until the movies came out and made a lot of money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious lover of TR is to stay away from this game, and if you buy a complaint to Eidos. I've seen a bunch of other posts, especially in the Eidos forums, from people telling them how much garbage they may be listening to.
