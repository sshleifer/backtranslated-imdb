Lame, lame, lame !!! 90-minute lubrication festival, 89 minutes long. The mature setting with the ambience and possibilities (an abandoned monastery) is wasted by stumbling through a text that is full of high-intensity dialogue and which strives hard to become hip joint. It is often embarrassing, and Gonzo's horror attempts fall down (a sample of this film's dialogue: after her artillery showed, Dolly quickly picked up a close-up of the wary Barbio character: any questions? Hyuk Hyuk Hyuck). It seems that the bad jokes that are full of vitality, the divine, the gay and the judgment of the influences of the creature, look like the "way out of the dead evil" seen by the director many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a lot of time to hire this turkey and expose them to ninety lost minutes they will never return. What a feces.
