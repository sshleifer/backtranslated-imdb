I am sad because a period of history is very fascinating and rich in material for the film can be converted into an important event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, and perhaps the most unusual figure of that period. Frank James was never mentioned, and Col. Younger, as previously, and the bloody Bill Anderson, who was crying over his murdered sister every time he fought, was completely absent in the text. Instead, we had to see fake characters that did not evolve into someone who cared about us. How sad this is. The costumes were fantastic however, as was the shooting site in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film of that period and try again, or another filmmaker will look into a huge wealth of material to write a play on screen.
