This was given 1. There are many plot transitions that can never be confirmed to the root. Total chaos. Everyone kills or nearly it. Tired of cross hair and changing views. I can not give the plot away. Twisted and crazy. If I had paid to see this I would ask for my money back. I wish the reviews were more honest.
