You can give JMS and boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the film is still substandard. Do not get me wrong, the B5 is the best television series ever, but if you're an executive watching this movie, I will not ask for the series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly, and there are tons of cliches. The same can be said for most of the first season (except for quadrilateral Babel and Survivors); Bruce put a fire instantly in the chain and continued to be a wonderful sight. If you're a fan of B5 and you do not see this movie, look for it. If you are a B5 fan, you will not want to watch the serial.
