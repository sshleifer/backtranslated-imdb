I hired it because the second part shocked me as a small child. I sneaked into the basement one early morning and started watching HBO, and the group (Part 2) terrorized me well. This time, I still enjoy the cruise, although I could not tell if it was because of nostalgia or if the time was too short. The other two were complete garbage. I can not believe a product paid somewhere to make this junk. All I have accomplished by watching this is to destroy the memory of another childhood. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad in my classical classic childhood list. 10/04
