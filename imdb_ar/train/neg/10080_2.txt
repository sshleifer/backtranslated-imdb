I had to look for actresses to find a painting of this film because the title is now "Unexpected Love". The search is not really worth it, but I was not used to both threads and wondered why they were affected by a lesbian click for life. Everything is largely restricted and you do not really get a clue as to what these characters, as viewers, have not been able to invest emotionally in the story. I think I'm not the target audience for this but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is silent and light-focused and the tones of the earth ... nothing very interesting. I had a great interest in seeing two women make them but they were treated so carefully that I was disappointed. Personal rental is better instead.
