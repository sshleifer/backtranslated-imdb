This movie is really bad. The representation is terribly easy except for Michael Ironside. I do not get the story. Richard Greco is the only survivor after a fight between the two Macs. He came to town and was suddenly chosen to fight against the bad guys who wanted Indian land. In the cover, he said that he was an Indian who also returned his city, and I did not hear that in the film, if it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Greco was a hell of a bad actor. Ugly and Ugly. His lines are like that too. We will not talk about Sean Young, who was not one of my favorite actors, but in this film she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Greco). It's awful. <br /> <br /> When you hired it, you chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I was supposed to touch Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> You do not see this unless you think Richard Greco looks harsh on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> I will be coming closer to the list of actors because I have at home. I wrote after I saw the movie.
