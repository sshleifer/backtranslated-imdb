Hollywood is doing it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the reviews, I thought this would be a funny film. But if you're not following the latest pop culture, you'll miss the most ridiculous humor in this film. Why waste your time. You can sit on a record doing nothing and enjoy more than this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
