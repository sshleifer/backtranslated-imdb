... one of the worst Swedish films ever ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not see the first movie (I was bored and that's why watching the second movie) before the first, well, I wish the first was better, it was full of strange cut scenes and strange plot changes Very, for people who have seen this and believe that 4/10 is high (believe me so)), but he made me laugh several times, because it was very strange and I still laugh at thinking the villain who came up with this idea, what is next "Det sjunde inseglet II "He said. The sequences that are not based on a novel or book do not turn into wonderful results often, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, I got a few of the nice jokes in it and the humor is slapstick. But do not buy it, hire it. Just let some other fools do or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and maybe the director is already laughing ...
