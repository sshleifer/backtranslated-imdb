An interesting exploit is somewhat of a black and white flick written by David F. Friedman. Leading actress Stacey Walker is a wonderfully attractive character.

Sam Melville (of The Rockies TV show) plays one of her friends, using a different name. <br /> <br /> Tony's best line - "Do you put me on a doll? Good B / W Cinematography of Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many more). Good languages ​​(cool pool, also used in DEFILERS). End strange but appropriate. A 4 out of 10. Best Performance Stacey Walker.
