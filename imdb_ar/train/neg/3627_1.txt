I'm not much for classic films. Movies such as Patton, Going My Way, and How Green were My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane. However, I'd better watch any one of those 3469 movies once while I was confined to a chair compared to watching an American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite at all. If you do the latter, it is possible that I sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the direction of colorful art and music, or Gershwin or Gershwin. Dancing and singing can help fall insomnia to sleep. The dialogue does not match Singin 'in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other film that I had been watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. We only slept 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> One star / 10 (very bad, we can not give zeros.)
