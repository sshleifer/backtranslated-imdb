I do not know what they were thinking. I mean by anyone connected even to this disaster. I've seen very bad films, I've seen very bad films, and then there. But I will say one thing written by the script has managed to put what could be a more unusual, written dialogue on the screen. Nothing is good for this film, either technically or from any other point of view. Released immediately. There are a few fairly known names in this film. In fact, I hesitate to use the word movie.it is like a set of random scenes that have nothing to do with one another and lead to less than zero. , You have failed to see why anyone with any dignity has appeared in this matter. I have become very cheap and I still feel bad. Even if you've got this movie for free, I'm still severed. This is absolute 0/10
