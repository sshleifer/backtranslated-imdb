Basically, there is a family that thinks a young boy (Jake) has a coma in his closet and his family are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than the soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all when you intend to make a movie, you have to decide whether it's a dramatic or dramatic movie! As a drama, the film is viewable. Parents divorce and argument like in real life. Then we have Jake with his closet which destroys all the film perfectly! I was expecting to see a movie similar to BOOGEYMAN, and instead I watched a drama with some sensational stunts. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just for parents who play well. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.
