Although in many ways I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I find the plot and idea very good. Many supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem in this film is Ellen Bombo. I'm sure I have never seen a less talented "actor". How was this person in any film or television, I can not imagine it. In my opinion, it will be better as the biggest in Wal-Mart. To see someone who has this low level of talent involved in pushing roles, does the question ask ... "Who do you know"? I would very much like to see this film hostile to some talent. I do not mistake the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to watch it.
