Kubrick meets the king. It looked very promising in the spring of 1980, as I remember. Then the film came out, and Kubrick scientists have been quarreling with the king's scientists ever since. <br /> <br /> King's scientists say that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and destroyed it. Kubrick's intellectuals do not like the story of the king. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, and camera angles. This film, insisting: should be considered on its own. As it happens, both camps are true. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If we look at it as the pure king novel, the "shining" is in fact a failed, missed opportunity, a series of failed narrative maneuvers. <br /> <br /> I used to blame the Koprick scriptwriter. Author Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) enjoys the reputation of a novelist of social literature. Perhaps she was chosen for her hidden understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small Sidewinder town of Blue Collar, Colorado does not exist on any map in its francophile world. <br /> <br /> However, Kubrick of the Angeloville found this child appropriate. Is, of course, the real author. Given its own merits, the scenario of his film "The Shining" - with a combination of abnormal, rational, supernatural psychology, and implicit reincarnation - does not stand up to a logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am willing to consider the "shining" Kubrick on their own terms. I'm ready to take it as something other than a traditional horror film. But it did not work as a natural study of isolation, isolation, and insanity as well. The film was analyzed in both cases to a large extent. <br /> <br /> Is the Overlook Hotel horrors true? Or does it exist only in the mind - first as nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then hallucination for his father? One notices how when he sees Jack Torrance talking to a "ghost", he actually looks at the mirror. One notices how the frozen hedge maze in the hotel symbolizes Jack's insensitive psychic. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if the Overlook "ghosts" are in fact pure manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing madness, who exactly allows the trapped Jack to get out of the deadly hotel kitchen cabinet, so he can continue his axial orbit? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white image (1921) of Nicholson as an evening party - what emerges from the left field and on the wall of the hotel hall during the closing seconds of the film ? Do we have to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from the experience of "past life"? (And if swallowed, since when are the people supposed to be material versions of themselves to be past?) Perhaps Kubrick did not care to tell his story. Perhaps he only wanted to raise the mood of terror. Whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets - to make it both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This film did not improve with age, and certainly did not improve with repeated views. <br /> <br /> Do not deny that a few moments of fear, fear of indoor, public horror is rampant throughout this long film long time. But those who flocked by Elevators o 'Blood, repeatedly seen in Danny's small visions, are ridiculous and ridiculous. The infamous Jack Torrance lines ("Wendy, I'm at home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Are just the huge tension hole in the film and the dissipation of its narrative power. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard that the audience was laughing with comic satisfaction: "Oh, I wonder, we do not have to take these things seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is quite at sea - or very sarcastically - during those scenes where Wendy wandered around the hotel Empty while her husband tries to crush their son. A lobby full of experienced guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Due to the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he has made a kind of eye-rending performance, the waving of the eyebrows, and the wonderful landscapes of the director. Required. Shelley Duvall, as a version of Don Knotts' "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken", is the best in silence. <br /> <br /> This film simply did not work - not as an adaptation, not as a condition. Probably worth 3 out of 10, but I give it a 1 because it is very highly appreciated in this forum.
