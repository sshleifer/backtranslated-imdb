This comedy is really not funny. It's a romantic story that plays a lot of stereotypes and does not affect. It is a very big derivative film - yes, even at that time - has no effect. <br /> <br /> The cast is appropriate. More difficult to say. However, what is nice is that the players are unfamiliar. At MGM, this was starring Robert Montgomery. Perhaps the wife of a businessman has no time for anything but work, no number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known film is loved by mostly unknown artists today. The production values ​​are not terrible. However, it does not give any real impression. <br /> <br /> It is a general knockoff. Who wants it?
