I thought it was a movie located in New York City: Wrong! It is a small British country place. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama .... well, until the last third, because after the story becomes "abracadabrantesque" in full, the symbolic word for a French presidential term. This means, close to nonsense, so that the motives would like to bring a true feeling. <br /> <br /> What did you leave? Maybe, the good duo of the actress: Yes, I know, they are friends of 3, but the red-haired policewoman is a bit invisible to me. The long surprise by her punch, McDowell made fine acting as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost muted position. This kindness evokes my confusion, because as great artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. In her condition, he resembles, whatever the film, he is always the same personality that determines her feelings and values ​​that live countless stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or fusion) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this film is its feminine touches and various interesting perspectives. Women have their own way of life, even if they are single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learn to witness how one reality can be conceived and unique in many ways like people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie can be seen perfectly, but the grand final cuts the desire to see the next.
