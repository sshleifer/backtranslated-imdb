Frankly, I went to watch the film, not because of the actors, not because of the plot but because it was rated here in Luxembourg 17 and the film must be brutal or truly pornographic to be placed in this category. Believe me, I'm a movie obsessed, I've seen a lot of brutal films in my life (Ichi Killer, Irresistible, Hellerizer) but this film was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen in my life <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid Clear, the guidance was awful, the acting was so mediocre that the music was a cheap version of the so-called "horror soundtrack". There is no single smart side in the entire film, and some scenes are really hard to stand in. (Especially the scene, where you see embryos in the glasses and hear the scream of the child - terrible). I can not understand why the film was rated in Germany at the age of 16, where the standards are usually strict (such as a breakout game) brutal but ridiculed by itself and have wonderful hints of Asian cinema along with great output (even a film like The Grace Case was rated 18). No one can call this film a "horror movie" because it was actually more emotional than to scare the audience ("The Face of the Creep" in the middle of the film was a very bad decision); for me (excuse me) Outside his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes, you see violence, has nothing to do with the scheme at all and does not explain anything. The plot contains holes and drawbacks, dull dialogue, and frankly I can not mention one positive aspect of the film except the British and Scottish dialect. <br /> <br /> If I have what I'm saying, this movie will be banned from the theaters, and I fully understand why no major production companies have invested their money in these wastes. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to receiving comments on my thread and I will be happy to discuss another topic or topic. <br /> <br /> "Levin" the little dream, Levin "Dream" David Aames
