The movie is worth 2/10. 1.5 star for the girl, (I'm sorry I'm biased, I think the beautiful girl is the highlight of the movies) and 0.5 for the fact that she is shorter than Azumi 1. I saw Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I was amazed at my ability to sit down. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the collection points in the movie. the girl. Otto Aya is cute. That's all there is to save the whole movie. The fact is that if the main character is male, I'm sure most people (including me) will not touch the film at all. <br /> <br /> Now, let's talk about subtraction points. First, it is a very difficult game, with lots and lots of repetitive scenes. Scenes Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It looks more like a drama mode of shooting. Japanese traditional drama loves memories of the past, this film also. Second, the film is very unrealistic in historical surroundings. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way to show creativity, by throwing ninja that works like bears, spider webs, etc ... reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantastically prepared film. Moreover, to film "I do not know" any effect, the director shoots people who die of blood spray (literally) everywhere ... people who did not realize their head have been cut ... etc ... etc ... etc. .. Lots of these show booty. It seems that the anime effect is strong in this film. It degrades the presentation considerably. Third, is not Azumi supposed to be a murderer? Looks like a man to me as a man, just because she's female. I do not think you see killers being accused in army camps. The only time I felt that she was acting "pet for the killer" was when she killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It's a linear plot with no development and no surprises in any way.
