Just what we need! Another remake of Hollywood's vintage cinema, with Eddie Murphy miscast again the second time around after Professor NUTTY (1996)! This explains why we have run out of special ideas in producing high-quality film, ladies and gentlemen! She has some signs of hope for her beloved and delightful images of animals that can act and talk to humans. Things can get worse, unfortunately. The bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family fun instantly. Even parents saw the publicity ad on the family channel, which was followed by deep anxiety and disgust in the cinema. It is sad to say that this is the pre-millennium era of the most progressive, but enjoy it while continuing because things can only get worse over time. There was a bigger error with the whole new DR. Dolittle. It's quite a plot, feeling very flat. I hate this annoying voice for Chris Rock !!! We need a more talented voice than a group of superheroes who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I have to agree that my local newspaper presented this among the top five films in 1998. Again, the original version was not good. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if not careful!
