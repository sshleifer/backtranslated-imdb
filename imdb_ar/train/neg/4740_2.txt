I'm deeply insulted by this film, it's not funny ... I think "Mulan" was incredible! Despite my low expectations for Disney, I never thought they would do anything so far. There is no respect here for any real Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to turn Wendy into a normal teenage girl ... but luckily, the most natural teenage girls - especially the Asian teenage girls - are less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. Culturally, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who have ended up in fashion and fashion, but they are fairly rare. And even those who are still fairly decent scientists. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite real. Because that's how Chinese parents work. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to go to authenticity, they would make Wendy a sarcastic girl with glasses and a relationship of emotional hatred with her family. <br /> <br /> This adds to my love of American films. Asian culture is not about contemplation and ambiguous expressions of nature that seem wise. We do not walk around smiling all the time, we do not know every form of martial arts. We are a people, and I would appreciate someone writing an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad caricature.
