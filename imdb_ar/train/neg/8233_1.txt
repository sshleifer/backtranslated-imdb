This was probably the worst film ever, seriously. I can do a better job myself, not set up properly. It's such a movie he had a budget of $ 5 and left with a change. Do not see it. I did not even get along this film, I had to stop it. We were given this 1/10 because it was funny how the producer of this movie wanted to be a horror film, but it actually turned into a very bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls collided with a car, broke the headlights, followed by the owner of that car. The thing I saw was women carrying a gun telling a group of girls to give up all their clothes, what the hell? There must be some sort of cheesy pornographic film as well.
