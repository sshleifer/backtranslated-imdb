This must be the cheapest film made in the 21st century. It is completely low quality, but it is ultimately less than ... everything. All cheap tricks - like luster and darkness - are used to hide those crazy computer effects. <br /> <br /> All actors are below average, especially the main character Ann Fletcher (Simon McKinnon). There is a scene, where Anne was asked: "Why do you look so neglected?" The correct answer is, because they can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, and her friend dies, she has been sacked), she has the same stupid smile in her face. <br /> <br /> It's not the only film of quality. It also describes the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray-Vessel, Capital-Vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description looks like a different film, both featuring a character called Fletcher and Sea Monsters
