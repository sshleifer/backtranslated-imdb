The concept of an interesting vampire has something to do with a virus (but has been done several times yet) Overall the film is very long and lasts a little. Editing can be more compact. I'm sorry to hear a problem with the credits. The film may have been moved to the market. The lighting was very dark in places. But the worst technical problem is the sound. The level was good enough to hear the dialog box, but many of the interior designs have a resonance to them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in recording, or maybe the sound mixing was better. Also a lot of background noise got through. Someone must have got sound effects for martial arts scenes. The tribe of small swords that were striking together was not the voice of an epic battle. In combat scenes, editing needed to be tougher. <br /> <br /> The representation was also a little flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that same person writing and starring in a film, in my experience, it was a red sign. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort so I gave it 4.
