This is the biggest piece of Lamo I have ever seen. It is unbearably boring, I would sit in a seminar about creation rather than watching this if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Not even 40 seconds of hot chick in the bikini with a big ta ta restores this from nothing less than 1. <br /> <br /> Notes This film, which claims that this film is "unintentionally funny" is silly and just wrong. There is one funny thing in this film. They spend the first 50 minutes or so walking through the jungle talking about things you do not understand or care about, and lame when people start dying because you do not even know who they are because they are not interested. Honestly, I have not seen it to the end, but this has to say something about how terrified it is. Worst film ever. <br /> <br /> Immediately after removing this filth from the DVD player, I started to remove it against the cement in front of my house, and I do not want other clients to have to make the same mistake as to rent this movie. Then Zach pee his pants. thank you for your time.
