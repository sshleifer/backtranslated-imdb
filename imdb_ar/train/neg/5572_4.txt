There is another colorful excuse for men wearing rubber suits to wrestle with each other. This time, time travelers of the future arrived in 1992 and employ a few people to return with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving Japan's future from destruction. But once this task was accomplished, the time traveled by travelers was revealed as a group of double cross whose own creature continues to ferment, without Godzilla to stop it ?? Estonian Krone! Everything seems very silly, and maybe so, but the plot is surprisingly good and the final battle looks very good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just bullshit rather than the funniest crap, and the film looks boring like its predecessors. Look for Spielberg crisp in a joke.
