Johnny Gunsmuller's latest film, "The King of the Jungle," after 16 years in his role, Tarzan and MERMAIDS, will disappoint all his fans. At the age of 44, the former Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active "party parties," skipped the youthful sportsmanship of his youth for a long time, and appeared tired (although he was marginally better than his former entry, Tarzan and the Beast) . <br /> <br /> Weissmuller was not too big for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the ideal "boy", grew up into masculinity (he was 17 years old), so he was written from the text, under the pretext of "getting away from school" . The 35-year-old Brenda Joyce appeared in her fourth film Jane (she would have made the move when she became the new Lex Parker Parker in 1949 from TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as exciting as ever. <br /> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, in RKO, with a limited budget, the crew and manual staff were cheaper to use than filming in Mexico.

After a series of discoveries ("God" is just a crooked man wearing a Aztec mask, working with the priest in Aleppo, the island's rich pearl family), and a bit of bold excitement, comic relief and songs for Benyigi, everything reaches a happy conclusion expected. <br /> <br /> TARZAN and MERMAIDS have a musical score by the great composer Dimitri Tiomkin, which is much better than you would expect from this movie "B"! <br /> <br /> While the film will provide a less auspicious end to Weissmler's time in Tarzan's main canvas (he would go immediately to play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent contrast to Ape Man, in Khakis), the talent involved raised the overall product on Little less than the total chaos that could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to get makeup and became more sexual ...
