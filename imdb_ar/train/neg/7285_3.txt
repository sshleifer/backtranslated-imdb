The sun must go out in this movie, forever. <br /> <br /> It lasts forever (which is not usually bad - the English patient, Schindler's list) but very boring. The aging of actors is unbelievable, as is the long and endless story line, which seems to be nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and movies.
