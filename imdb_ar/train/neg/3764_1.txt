It is definitely the worst film I have ever seen, and perhaps the worst film I have ever seen. The actors and actors were terrible and they seemed to be trying in a very difficult way to play their roles like dorks, young players, shakes, know everything, etc. It seems to be the type of image created by the computer from the Atari & Intellivision days. At some point near the end of the film, while an army of hackers were chasing the survivors, one of them was shot and looked like a copy of a poor man from Donkey Kong! One was hit by a bullet and the blood coming out of it was just horrible cartoons. Another annoying thing was the music. Way way too much music (classic score or what you call it) throughout the entire movie. It never ends. Oh yeah, the film is too boring. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend taking $ 3 or any shipping charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value list somewhere. Really cool!
