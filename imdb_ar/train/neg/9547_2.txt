A lower-than-average video game is transformed into a conspiracy to discover the next terrorist in the backyard of the United States. Welcome to the madness of cheap movies that are broadcast live. It is full of actors with no name and actresses with a low-value plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, this strange game continues and the "hero" betrays real money and does it well. It's a type of gambling, with the exception of the gambling part and may be sucked. Instead, it's an online game with little real value and you get powers in your tail if you do a good job. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more bizarre is that there are two strange computer programs that go around in one way or another and everything is saved in the end. I will leave the viewer to see how everything has come to fruition. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not worth renting a dollar. Please borrow. "Dr-"
