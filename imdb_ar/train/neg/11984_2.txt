Ugh! Another one of those "fooled by the lid" DVDs. I was expecting a bit of work with at least bears, cats, etc. on the cover. I did not get anything! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that something would happen in the end ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now the reason I was given this 2 is because of the scene. Otherwise, it may suck. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, talking to himself (although I suppose they could not play a movie with stupid music and no dialogue at all), he was doing lame karate positions on a stump tree, threatening the raccoon, and chewing on the worms , And (what dumbass) kicked the porcupine. He would not be pulling those feathers that easy either ... they stick like aquariums. At least Bear fought (weak) several times. <br /> <br /> What happened with the flashback thing? Making a bad movie even worse. I wanted to watch a movie to survive, not some dramatic films about a child suffering from a divorce. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Well, maybe they should have a bear eating baby or something. At least that would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this.
