There is a good thing. There is bad. Then their film The Sentinel, the political "thrill" that ranks among the worst films I have ever seen. The mole plot in the Secret Service is a good idea, but the film has never been killed by a lot of potential. Each actor in this film appears to be working on autopilot directed by Clark Johnson, who is run by Pork. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have never seen, for the rest of my life, another film with a lot of stark plot holes. Prediction can be predicted from the first box, and personal motives are so ridiculous that they inspire laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a disaster for a film worthless.
