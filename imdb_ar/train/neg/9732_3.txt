First, lead, Brad Doriff is a cook. If you try to take this movie seriously, I guarantee it will spoil you. If you do not take it seriously, it's really fun to watch. As with other references, I liked the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Payne) and Duyave express their love for each other - between avoiding the flames and shooting from his arm in the car. Another wonderful scene in the camp was watching John Landis as a mucous radio producer getting toast and pouring around the room. In fact, I found that the last 15 minutes of the film were non-stop riots - I'm not sure if Tobe Hooper meant to be that way.
