Seriously - avoid this movie at all costs. I've just seen it in my first "sneak preview" ever, and although I paid non-refundable money, I left the cinema only 15 minutes later. Which already includes two minutes of discussion between my friends whether you are leaving or not. The first time ever I came out of a movie. I've lived some bad movies. <br /> <br /> It's one of those films (so bad) that they are shown in their original language. Depends on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the military ("What do we do when we get to the fighting zone?" - "You get out of the car and die"; in fact, it is very interesting to read here that the way it was delivered in the film) "He said." We are promised guns! "" This is the way, this is the way, "he said. The way it will stay "). Well, you may find these songs really funny, but in this case it scares me badly. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have seen the best representation in the kind of soft porn that shows you on European television late at night. So she had the lame jokes (poorly delivered), behind the low representation medium, lacked the pace, and was called bad and edited? It just did not work. At least not at any level used as a film measure. <br /> <br /> I would be very bold to say that this click proves that there are people who can be a lot less than the Germans. This is something to say if you like stereotypes. (But I do not, it's good to play with them, but if someone thinks I'm not using the computer enough.) <br /> <br /> Instead of going to watch this movie, do something useful. Try to teach knitting on prawns, draw your nails in a really annoying color, unclog your bike, change some bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, switch to a different religion and return - in fact, go and listen to the "Last Christmas" by Wham! Their repetition is endless. Nothing, but you do not see this awful flick.
