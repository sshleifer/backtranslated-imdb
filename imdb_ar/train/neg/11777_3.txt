Years ago I saw Godfather had a lasting effect on me, Joe was a first-class film, unforgettable representation, the classic story. I recently purchased Trilogy and after watching the first part again, I looked forward to watching Part 2 ...... I was very pleased to get to know early in Part 2 so that it was an appropriate follow-up to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfection I could wait to see the third Godfather ........ wrong! , I wish I had stopped at the second. The story was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up only of a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pachino's fort was a weak figure that would be eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone being invested with all traces of the Catholic Church with a whole choir, a killer on horseback away at sunset, an unseen helicopter launch mechanism for the meeting "Goodies" and shoot anyone else) and his daughter and his first cousin who wraps a piece of pasta on the blackboard, pathetic shooting on the steps ..... orange juice for diabetes (man of his intelligence and absence is not ready for emergencies?). .. no it was not good and with the best will in the world I would not be able to see it again. But I will watch 1 and 2 times several over the years.
