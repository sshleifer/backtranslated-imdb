The. worst. Movie. Start. MADE. <br /> <br /> After watching this supposedly gay film, I think someone has assembled his brain, which has suffered a bad fit from half of the neo-Nazis and made it the worst gay film ever made, all in a misguided attempt to attack a culture. Homosexuals. I had to stop the movie and called a friend to come completely, so someone had to make fun of him when he paused the film because of the shock, disbelief and anger of this absolute stupidity. <br /> <br /> Moreover terrible writing, acting and an illogical and stupid plot, it's just a bad-made movie. Perhaps the dog with the Handycam camera is strapped to his tail better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews of this film here, I think the writer should have half IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this movie is even watched like anything other than a joke, is a liar or is paying big sums to say it.
