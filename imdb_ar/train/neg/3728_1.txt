As some other comments show, this movie may scare you when you are a young child. (This is probably all that is good for it.) <br /> <br /> However, if you are older, this movie does one thing: sucking heavily - so I do not mean acting, soundtrack, cut or like this. I am simply talking about the "plot" (if you can call it). <br /> <br /> The spoilers forward ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more spoilers Too much (if you still want to watch this movie after reading it), but if you graduate from any school, it's just a big insult to your intelligence. When I saw this thing, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - UNITE (UN UN Evil) Assembly) <br /> <br /> - We are just supposed to believe that it is evil. Is it even evil at all? If so: why is evil? <br /> <br /> - An evil sign in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> - There is no need to force this on people, so why the hell (not pun intended) do they? <br /> <br /> - Calling Christ to your heart only as an oral service <br /> <br /> - Because there is nothing for anyone, who is considered a "true Christian" in this film, as he does, besides That stupid prayer. So ... I just say that prayer before the rapture and you are savior - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> Thus, the 1/10 rating
