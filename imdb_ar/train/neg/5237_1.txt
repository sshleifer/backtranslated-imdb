One of the, if not the worst film coming out of Britain in the eighties. <br /> <br /> This miserable tale of middle-aged lament "seduces" two teenagers' washing machines for which he and his wife, the luxury, have nothing to recover. <br /> <br />, childish, unrealistic and unrealistic, this film proves the depths because it failed miserably in its attempt to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this film is how the strong actors of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Seobhan Veynan are sewn in full by such a lame scenario. It is not surprising that this is the only work done by the late Andrea Dunbar to be displayed on screen. Complete and read the trash on each level.
