I was recently browsing a site that shows public domain movies. On their long list of films was this film and I think I should have Ahlous in such a satisfactory and presumptuous address. But, no, that's what it really was. Since the film was only about 27 minutes, I decided to try it. If it turned out to be a pornographic film, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most unusual movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team, with a budget of about $ 49, tried to produce a Star Trek movie about a crew of gay men traveling around the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all women - as they did in the land! In each case, she was greeted with cheers and thanks from gay men now from the planet. <br /> <br /> Hidden, this is not so. With some of the most outrageous characters and events of the characters I've heard before, I do not even think I can write them on IMDb without removing my review! However, despite the absolute harshness of everything, it was only strange and worth a peek. But, as I have already mentioned, given the raw names and the strange subject (although there is no nudity), it is an adult film only. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me 1001 questions for who would do it, why did WHO make it a target audience?! It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest thing and probably the most offensive!
