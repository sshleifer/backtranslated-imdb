Does Frances Ford suffer from an enlarged blood vessel for some time after the production of the film "End of the World Now" which made him unable to produce a good film? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" were thinking when making this flimsy movie. He gives Kathleen Turner a championship car, plays a woman who travels back on time, returns adolescence to adolescence, knows all the things life has taught her when she's grown up, and Turner, her soldier, does what she can. This movie, but can not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> He does not have any style for him, and given his graduation, one would expect that even if he had nothing else, she would have it. <br /> <br /> Row: C-
