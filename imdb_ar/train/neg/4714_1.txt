I badly want to give this piece of zero garbage, unfortunately, there is no, so, I had to give it only 1 to warn you of how awesome this antichrist is from a familiar cartoon! The characters look like they were drawn by pre-school children, no, wait, I've seen pre-school kids do a better job! Best "Misadventures of Flapjack" on this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I might say what the others said, two words: RIP OFF !! Do you remember that episode from Dexter's Lab when they were racing a little car down the volcano? Yes, Mr. Mister dismissed this idea and failed! They even broke up from Shadow Lugia in that episode that ridiculed Pokemon! (So ​​he took advantage of this privilege!) This character is a cheap rip from the Mandark of Dexter's Lab! Master colleagues need to sue for legal infringement of this piece of crap! Everyone has their own opinion, but those who love Johnny Test (RIP-OFF), you lie to yourselves. Do yourself, change the channel when this ripping tries to ruin your screen!
