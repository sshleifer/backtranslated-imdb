I can not believe that people thought the stinking trash pile was funny. The switch of humor between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is nothing about Mary" leaves little to stay to the end. Cameron Diaz is certainly very beautiful, but that will not be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work inside the plot, obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> It was not possible to believe any of the scenes at once. The shots were badly timed and badly framed. Brothers Varelli should be removed from filmmaking at any price. I check IMDB to see what they are working on so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The reward is the time you smiled at. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it too. The next day we saw Rush Hour and we laughed silly. This movie only stunk.
