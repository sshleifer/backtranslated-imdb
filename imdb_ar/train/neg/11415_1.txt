Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a vulgar piece of junk. Set up a high school comedy at a military training camp. I'm sorry I had to give one star that I did not deserve. <br /> <br /> This may contain spoiled: <br /> <br /> Everything is completely forced, unconvincing, and unrealistic. HEPO will not get you if you do not attend your appearance, especially on your wedding day. The actors were very embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work because it was very unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not bad actors, they could not save the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, a man must train on wedding clothes. No, there was no time to make him wear the uniform first. Man, this is a great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also girls in the camp - two exciting - even one of the models, although it does not look great - and the worst actress I've ever seen in my life I doubt in Hollywood they let her say one line in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well the girls are in the army! Now this enjoys. The girls are put on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they will be placed in a different building a quarter mile away, separated by two rows of barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are lockers available that we can use for an enjoyable trip in our spare time, of which we have many. No, the cabinets are not closed, ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are a variety of sexual sights and references all under the waste line. We need these guys so the sex-obsessed Germans will love the film as well. Switzerland is a very small market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> One sexy scene occurs in the kitchen. Certainly, none of these facilities have been closed. The military routine is as dirty as they can get it. <br /> <br /> At the end of a mindless flick, the men who beat the Mafia are about to take revenge on the poor man who is trying to shoot him! Because he abandoned his fianc√©e! Definitely buy it, the Italians this way - a bunch of jealous (no). <br /> <br /> The villains are trying to do it in broad daylight with 20 eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training venues (where live ammunition is fired) are open to the public, and anyone can drive freely or walk there. There are no things like guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However the act is prevented by a good commander in time to launch a rocket at the Italians' car. The explosion knocks the wounded men and angry fiance from their feet. No one was hurt at a distance of 40 feet when the car blew up for blacksmithing. It's a comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I got it, and I can live it. No realism needed. Cinematographers can easily access this if it is fun, controversial, fun, fun and difficult. Unfortunately there is none of these. It's just embarrassing. Rip of American comedy movies without brains. It is done at least professionally, with no amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's a very boring and predictable thing, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who sit in the entire movie as you did with regret. Yawning.
