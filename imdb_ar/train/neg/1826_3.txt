I saw this movie last night, and even after a few kinds of beer, it was the only laugh that came out of this film when I realized I was already watching it. In one word, it is strange. Not funny. I completely think tidbit tidbit about black jack apologize for making this garbage. I can not believe that Barry Levinson did not throw this text just when he read the front page. Moreover, I can not believe I saw more than ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 out of 10 * because I like to see Christopher and make terrible movies for pay. Also, the horse "corky", once it exists as a character in this film, is really very silly.
