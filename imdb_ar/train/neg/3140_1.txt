What I think is the best thing about the new Star Wars movie, Phantom Minas, is that it is possible to blow Titanic out of the water if you pardon the pun, when it comes to a box that destroys purely office receipts, and thus gets rid of the number one place. Every time I hear someone say that Titanic is the greatest film I've ever seen, I think to myself, "You do not see a lot of movies, do you?" What a farce. You can produce 50 good films that are much better than "Titanic", at the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, I've won many academic awards, many people have loved them," someone might say in his defense. Well, a lot of people like Spice Girls and billions and billions of people are eating McDonalds, but that does not mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of fans of Elvis can be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the great hype on the film. I waited a month or so to see her and in the end she did not live up to expectations, which called for more attention to the terrible stupid love story. It is true that Phantom Menas is likely to suffer the same fate. But. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is. A) Dust the work disguised as a thin piece as a dangerous period piece. B) A three-hour epic with the most beautiful moments in the trailer. C) A naive love story that goes beyond belief or entertainment. D) There is something left better for notaries, which I would have enjoyed much more. E) Film arrogantly lives on a level featured with the real ship. F) A 3-hour theft I will never go back to, so the biggest drive for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone I have not seen yet, I say, "I hope I can share places with you." G) Slap in the face for any real victim to reduce body temperature. How much time is it supposed to believe that people can sink into freezing cold water and still make up clear sentences? H) Thankfully the film did not recognize any representation achievements at the Oscars. i) technological achievement in filmmaking, and much more. <br /> <br /> The only reason for publishing this as an anonymous comment is that I do not welcome the refutation of the 10,000 fans of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is thirteen years old and who is undoubtedly coming to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing the defense About the Titanic story, acting or length.
