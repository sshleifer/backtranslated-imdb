The film revolves around a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. One day he decides to kill some relatives of his clients. At about the same time, he was designing a model for his murder after the 1960s killer zodiac. He communicates with the author of Zodiac Killer and makes friends. Michael has a weapon (the only gun, as it appears to be in the hands of some other actors, not portrayed as the same gun). A native. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you love B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but editing and acting were already drowned in the plot. I thought the "blood" was very fake and the lighting was awful in some places and the dialogue was very standard. The film was filmed on video, which is acceptable, but the film has just been released for some scenes of the exotic "Plan 9". It's not a bad movie for B-type fans, but if you want something more polished, go to something else.
