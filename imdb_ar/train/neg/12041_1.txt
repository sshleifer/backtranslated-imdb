Well, was it the beginning? This is by far one of the worst movies I have paid for money. I will not comment on the same story, it's a great classic story, but here it looks like a soap opera. First of all, the acting, except Eric Pana, is the quality of the soap opera. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but every actor in The Bold and the Beautiful puts him in shame. Working the camera does not help, either. How to keep it when he thinks, it takes me back to Brock Forester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has had very bad cosmetic surgery, or is in desperate need of it. Either way, he is more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! To end my comments, Diane Kruger is a nice girl, but she certainly is not Helene of Troy. Peterson had to choose Saffron Burrows for this post, because Elizabeth Taylor would be misleading now.
