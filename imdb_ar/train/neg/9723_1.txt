Jeux d'enfants or the way the movie was translated in the wrong way into English Love me if You Dare is a film made by stupid people and stupid people. I do not know how to expect something worth watching from a movie like this: two foolish ignorant children bet that each of them will do something (certainly a very stupid one) to prove to one another (and they are "cool men"). But instead of realizing that they are just an eccentric person, they continue to do their crazy work, believing that they are wonderful people. <br /> <br /> One can expect such a movie from Hollywood , But France? S most disgraceful film watch from the state that Emily invented two years ago, which, though, tries to film N, but it seems too far, too far away. <br /> <br /> avoided. Avoid. Avoid.
