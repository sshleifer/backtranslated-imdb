I did not finish this movie for some reason, it was awful and it was just a representation. I was not sure what the film was about tbh did not make much sense and the violence was awful. I usually mean I like some bare pictures in the movie (lol), but he was sick because of what was happening. I was bothered by all the characters and it was full of loud screams and the camera was vibrating in pieces and looked like a sequel to the tile with the project but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time and I would like to come back my time please. I do not recommend this movie to anyone or even think about it. (N)
