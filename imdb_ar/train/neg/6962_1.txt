How can good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet take part in such a ... well, such a thing? I can not get it. It was awful, it was played very erratically (but some leadership roles are a few), stupid jokes and not funny at all ... I will not talk more about this movie, except one small tip: do not go to see it, it would be a waste of time and money.
