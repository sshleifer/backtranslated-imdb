I think we're all starting a lot of reviews, "it might be making a great movie." The former deceived con newly spread, a suburban family arranged his goal. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Put Marty's usual drink for Caro. But unfortunately somewhere in the high note of Universal, it fell on everyone: everyone installed it. <br /> <br /> Nolte talks only about the eyebrows raised, Lang leaves her way through the cigarettes, Louis "Ohmagod's!" On her way though, Bobby D ... well, it's on another magic carpet complete. Affecting some kind of Cajun / Huckleberry accent Hound hybrids, he collides cigars and fat in random horrors such as "baby trouble". I want you to imagine the tone above. Now imagine that he expresses a religious language clinging to the brain at the top like swallowed six gospels, and you have a Chetec from De Niro here. The most distraction of all, however, is the more his use is "De Niro's Face" which ignores him. Eyes staring, forehead curly, curly lips. It seems that Karimani, Bob, resembles a plastic man. <br /> <br /> It seems that the story started off the screen 14 years ago, when Nolte was unable to save De Niro's time at the Big House in many attacks. Upon his release, he feels he has misled him to turn back and then orders him and his relatives to be intimidated. We are supposed to give De Niro's character a simple pass because Nolte has withheld information that may have shortened his sentence. Con de Niro is one of those criminals who, despite his condemnation of unspeakable acts, feels that his lack of freedom justifies the continuation of such acts abroad. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> He is following Nol's close mistress (in a scene some may want to get away from) and his wife, daughter and family dog, you know. Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick's scenario: the ability to predict absolute. Since all of Nero's harassment becomes more horrific, you can call the rest of the events before they happen. Stryk will not be entirely credible, because he manages a few convoluted moments driven by dialogue (De Niro and Lewis in an empty theater is the best scene for the film), but mostly everything was exhausting. Scorsese's cartoonist approach is forced, not to mention the obsolete, reconstructed Bernard Hermann's result (I waited for the wolf man to appear with the genetically expanded tarantula). <br /> <br /> So we got in the comic part of the flick. Comic inadvertently, that is. You know those scenes in which something terrible happens graphically, but you can only make fun of other people's eyes? You will do it here. Nolte and Lange were bemused by infidelity, Nero's thumb-jerk, and he was taking off clothes, and the kitchen slider on a certain material had to be certified. BOB, HELL, CONTINUOUS, CONSTANT, TERRIBLE TO THE MIND, ENDING IN THE HORRIBLE WALKING OUT OF ALL "PHILOSOPHY" DISCOVERED IN JAIL. I wanted to kill him for closing him more than to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow ideas from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This really * is * Scorsese version of Freddie Krueger. The manner in which De Niro enjoys, speaks, stems, and resists pain, down to his individual qualities, is Freddy. When you are burned by a measure of water thrown: "Are you trying" to offer a hot sip? "Only one example. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of the original 1962 flick and want to thrill to see Balsam, Peck and Mitchum after nearly 30 years (or want a serious movie shaking his head experience), avoid Journey to Cape.
