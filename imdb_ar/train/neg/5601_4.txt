I saw this only because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and included Claudio Cassinelli, a loved actor. I was definitely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that convicted prisoners will fight to death because of their TV ratings has been overtaken by Roller Paul, Logan Run, Blade Runner, and the new film, The Race of Death, which I will definitely absorb because it is the star of Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> This was just a cavity for the most part. The "kill the bike" job was ridiculous. The "training" was a snooze festival. I have never caught me and made me want to pay attention to anyone, including the star of "Dallas" Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others listed above and you'll be better off.
