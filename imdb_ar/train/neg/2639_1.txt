Let's start this review first by the fact that I just participated in writing the review and warning people to save their money !! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst pieces I've seen since The Hulk. The story was the most predictable garbage you could find. If you expect 24 but on the big screen, immediately dismiss this expectation with the money you will use to get a ticket .. You may get more fun this way. The plot was terrible, and the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "Twist" in the end ... I must say this ... The end surprised me.) I'm not referring to the evolution of the plot that surprised me, but instead the simple way they assembled The only decent work scene in the entire film, they rushed to the end so quickly that I did not realize it was over until I saw the credits flow and at that point I thought about burning the reel if I could figure out how to get to this showroom. /> <br /> Photography was so bad for several reasons: First of all, I must They have changed the characterizations by mistake, because Michael Douglas played the role of the player who had to play CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland, while Douglas was sneaking around the agents and clicking on the telephone lines, breaking the rules and chasing the people chasing him, Sutherland plays the role of the less capable agent who He is always in the mood for advertising even when things do not go badly for him, he plays a very nice role, nothing like the kind of Jack Bauer we like 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can only promise that this movie will disappoint you in all areas. It can be compared better with a new edition of "Fugitive" / "in the line of fire" but written by people with mental disabilities
