I and a bunch of friends are renting awesome videos to laugh at, trust me that they led to some terribly wasted money as well as some great laughs. Illness. Is one of the best horror movies that we've rented. This plot has been completed, and everyone takes your friends to the forest and will not return anything very old. The most wonderful part of the film is your visit to the local butcher shop with the exception of a little dirt and blood on the paste of the play looking for meat. If anyone ever afraid of this movie ever has to stick to the Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the film are that the two girls are reasonably lively, one better than the other and naked in the film. The other good side is that this movie is so bad sometimes that you laugh until you cry. I do not like watching or renting these terrible videos, I do not find this fun, but seeing how much effort these people are making and still coming out of something very bad is hilarious and worth leasing. Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's flaws, I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If you rent him / her to laugh at him, I'll give him 8.5.
