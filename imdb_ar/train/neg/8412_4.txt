I've only seen DreamGirls yesterday and you're really less than real. Despite all the buzz Oscar, this is something special. Anyone really impressed with this movie has never bothered you to see any of the classics of the real musical. With the exception of the great musical and dramatic performance of Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is just a glamorous TV movie without style or inclination. Just a bunch of amateurs singing with each other! <br /> <br /> Now, the first half hour was good, but I was outraged at how the great Eddie Murphy's performances were cut off in the rave and interrupted by the montage. Those were the best songs and best performances in the film easily. The "Up to the Top" part of the film was the only part of the film that had a fixed view or no momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a heterogeneous mess that was neither realistic nor fascinating enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included many sound-like melodies. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to convert any of the melodies into large pieces as I expected. Each number in the second half was just one shot after another of people "singing" at each other. The way they launched the big Hudson number "Loved me" was criminal! Condon just called it trampled about the theater - no drama at all! Insha'Allah! <br /> <br /> All concerned noted that the "dialogue of singing dialogue" may work on the stage, but it does not work in films (see the failures of Avita and Phantom of embarrassment). All that "I'll come back to you with something!" It must be nonsense left on the floor of the editing room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Once again, the film - with the exception of Eddie Murphy's stunning performance - was nothing more than a TV movie glorifying him. There must be a megabucks behind the PR action for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to give it "what to overcome" before the buzz of Oscar? As a whole this film, except for Eddie, was now near the Oscar caliber film! (Except Eddie) I would put it in first place with Grease 2 disappointment. BIG, especially after all the hype (seemed very expensive).
