With Werner Herzog's pseudonym and liberal aid from Kubrick, Hanick and Noy, it is painfully clear that Thomas Clay considers himself above the usual kind of trash that British cinema has spread. Robert Carmichael (in short) himself is a realistic study of young alienation, and at the same time seems to be critical of the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are very unrealistic and atypical - unlike the bold imaginations of "extreme" directors and most teenagers are not drug addicts rapists. As a critic of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - a sub-community that has hurt this sensitive person) is so childish that he hardly thinks about it. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have exaggerated it. Like Kubrick and No, the desire for trauma associated with presumed serious intentions appears to be the worst cinematic trick of a modern film. Orange Orange was loved by people because they loved rape and violence, but most of all they loved cultural superiority because they liked the things they most hated. Much of Kubrick is not enough Haneke (director of serious and moral films) here describes this as one of the most courageous films in years. (I'm not against the violence in the film.) To do this seriously is a tough trick though - people at Alex's cinemas shouted at Clockwork Orange to show how the supposed Kubrick intention of Miles has been missed. .)
