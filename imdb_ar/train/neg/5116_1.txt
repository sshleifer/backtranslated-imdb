I rented this movie today believing it might be a good football movie, because I am a big fan of football. Boy, I was wrong. This film is a very religious and preaching method and is really unrealistic. This film says pretty much that if you have a Christian you can get anything you want in life easily, like becoming a great football player! You do not become a great football player when you become a Christian and ask God, but do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and give you anything .... That's not true at all, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny was when they were stupid (Schultz cartoonist? I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian.
