Given the history of the director of this film, it is hard to believe that this film was so bad. I was at the European show last night and was one of the executive producers there. It was not yet to watch the film, the boy was, to a surprise. I did not read the book on which it was based, and I do not know whether it was highly appreciated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Mandolin's Captain Colin" and I was given how poorly adapted it is to the screen and how bad this film is, just assume that something similar has happened here. The representation was not bad despite the presence of many eyebrows from Farrell. Frankly, I can not believe how much I cared about any character in this film. Positions play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part consists of a few scenes where he opens the door and says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I was not on the screen. I never made a film, but I was tempted to start with it. I've given this movie a grade of "2" for reasons that seem terribly shallow to me but these are the best things I can say about this film. The first is that I really enjoyed the very short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek has become naked and looks beautiful. I can say something positive about this film. Do not ask anything about the dust, can not talk!
