Like most of the people I was interested in when I heard the concept of this film, especially the "filmmakers who were attacked" that the case seems to confirm, what is being chased by an angry group angry at the picture on the cover of the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Then, to watch the film and discover it, oh, what do you mean by "filmmakers were attacked"? Some children threw stones at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said, "Someone must beat these two children. "The picture on the cover," stalking "as it was? Total fabrication. What I think it links him to the subject of the film, lying and manipulating to satisfy stupid children in vain with more money and time then feeling. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this movie. Michael Moore is likened to "Roger & Me", but if "Roger & Me" makes fun of the Flint people. It's completely wrong and completely unknown. Wonderful! Can you believe that the people who suffered under the yoke of communism will be really excited about the existence of markets full of food? What a shakes! Not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and Western media, blah blah blah," because it was not only that their fake market had comparable prices with competitors. That was, as many people in the film say, Someone mentioned that they should have known that he was fake in terms of the amount they were shipping for the duck. This proves nothing but the poor, they will go to a shop with low prices, Bravo bruises, a way to put people down. <br /> <br /> A way to play a stupid practical joke on the elderly. You should be very proud. What about your next film, where you're making a documentary about Iraq and showing how people will be really excited about a house without holes in the walls, then say, "Haha, there's no such house! <br /> <br /> Morgan "Please Like" Sporlock unleashed this fart from a film and not surprisingly since Spurlock as it seems that Wonder Wonder World Prince of Documentary casts his weight behind any ridiculous sounding concept of staying relevant in a world that is not needed Really. <br /> <br /> Avoid like plague.
