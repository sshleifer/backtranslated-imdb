I watched the Canadian video of this movie entitled "The Witch" which somehow reached New York State. The sound was so bad, I had to lift it up to about 7/8 just because it was heard and the soundtrack was often beat on the dialog. Orson and Willis were Katsma, and worse than usual, some of his dialogues and other dialogues were run through the Echo Room. An erotica character that continued to appear was distorted. Some closed captions have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of magicians or demons (the final appropriations indicate that the group was not meant to represent any real group!) have rituals where they show naked and cause abortions to stab a doll. The woman who had been aborted and her husband moved to a town called Lilith, where he was offered a job at a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs for this film seems to be "The Toy Factory", we never see it, and is only occasionally referred to. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lillith, her husband is impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss, Mr. Kato, wants to know about their religious persuasion. He drives hard, causing another car to explode from the road and explode. After the arrival of the police, I took the doll that fell from the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turned out that Mr. Cato and all the townspeople were witches, and that they had caused her abortion, although she did not realize it. They want her because she has an innate gift of conjuring up spirits, which she did not really understand. <br /> <br /> Some images in the film have some effect, but the film in general has little impact. The movie looks chaotic, and this is undoubtedly due largely to re-editing and adding new footage. The original, according to the final appropriations, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The DVD may allow us to see both versions on a single disc, but re-releasing this movie may not be a priority.
