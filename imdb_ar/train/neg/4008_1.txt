As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a great representation for them. Vampire vampire is not good looking and looks older than what is described in the book. I found that they made fantastic colorful characters that really looked wonderful and dazzling. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the waste they go through in Sookie she is always a lady, yet in the TV series she does not seem so at all. Not only that, but the prejudices presented in the television series are not widespread in the books. I did not expect a replica of the books but at least I expected that their feeling would be used in the series.
