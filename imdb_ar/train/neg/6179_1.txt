This is the second worst movie I have ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is no conspiracy, climax, conflict, or any other key details required in the story. This "film" is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his manly side and "The Strong Guy Is Really". I wasted my time watching this movie. The best part should be the final balances. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would cut off my thumb and throw it at the producers. It is clear that Toby Keith has the right to give them the opportunity to act in a feature film, which is clearly at the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it may be the only thing you regret.
