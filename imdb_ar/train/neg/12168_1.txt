This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the film is that Angela wanted to get a large number of people. The acting was terrible. The killings were carried out very badly. Like when an ally pressed down this toilet I thought it was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the film comes, when Molly and the other person in the cabin, you will see an ally so Angela must have gone to evoke. The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the string on the guitar and beat it. One of them was terrible, and why only two, can not you turn around and press the bitch?!?!? Then when you chase Angela Molly if you have a noisy why not spin around and stab ??? so stupid. This film sucked ...
