As far as I can, I think this film is a waste of time. I did not find him a warm and satisfying film for others. I found it boring, with the music I acted on the film. The story was high, the characters were submerged, and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'll write a little more about this movie, so I'm making a 10-line minimum. There is really nothing to be said, concise is important, but IMDb has a minimum, so here goes. <br /> <br /> A child's passionate passion finds an emerging talent, looking for time with old age and a confused mentor despite his father. Homophobia of cartoonism. Aging, bitterness mentor turns out to drink too much and teach very little. Conflict arises. Although I do not think this is a spoiler, I only added the warning if someone felt that this information was too many. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the film found boredom and homeland. A waste of my time. Frankly I do not understand what seems to be a little fuss, mostly on this site, about the consistent quality of this film. I think it really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller used to say, "I might be wrong."
