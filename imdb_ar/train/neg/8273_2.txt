Plenty of promise and nothing more. Sure all the team stars cast by Hong Kong standards, but man man oh this one stinky. No story? All right, the procedure will compensate for it like most clicks of Hong Kong work. What? The work is terrible, tacky, and scattered? The Dragon Dynasty releases to date are very impressive and generally considered a classic in Asian cinema. This is a scourge. They have succeeded in provoking controversy between two representatives of infernal affairs, but they can not bring life back to written text. There are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a gap between each other and a lack of continuity in what the characters say. They almost feel like they are giving a living monologue and ignoring other characters. Michael Bean is made of wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a double trick? Not possible. Yes way. stay away.
