The stunning "Deadlock" by Leslie Sands became a bad way to win Bette Davis and Gary Merrill after their joint success in "All About Eve". After her husband is killed, the best friend of her husband visits a planned woman and passes himself off as her husband as soon as others begin to stop at home. It is unfortunate that Irving Rapper, one of the best directors in a house of the peak years, is unable to lift this ridiculous article, as Davis was angry with himself and restraint until the outrageous end (fortunately withdrawing all stations). Produce and support the precision cast of the second class. Only for Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
