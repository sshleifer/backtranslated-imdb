"Baby Problem" is one of the most luxurious films ever produced. This is not the worst (although some people with me about it will be any different), but it is not the best, too. It is about a boy with a demonic 7 years old destroys chaos comics on a couple without children (John Ritter, Amy Aaspak) who is adopted foolishly. This film is very ridiculous and not credible because I do not buy for one second that the child is acting in a way that is abnormal as the child does in this film. It's eccentric and repulsive though I laughed several times all the time (I do not really know why). But I can not recommend this film. I know I'm very nice. If there is one positive thing about Baby Problem is that it is better than a sequel which was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
