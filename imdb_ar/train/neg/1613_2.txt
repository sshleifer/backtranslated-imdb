Now that Che (2008) has finished showing his relatively short Australian film (very limited version: one screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can join "At The Movies" hosts in moving Steven Soderbergh to the task. <br /> <br /> A patient usually watches a film director change his style / theme, but the latest experience at Soderbergh, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story, so the narrative seems to suddenly appear in Soderbergh. The main challenge. Strange, after 20 odd years at work. Perhaps it was never good in the narrative, I hid it well within the "passive" projects. <br /> <br /> None of this is currently exempted, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "Two parts of Chi do not do anything perfect." <br /> <br /> The biographical saga by name only, Che (2008) hardly qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, except for the extraordinary final decision imposed by history, the 4.5-hour-long Sundberg does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Bumerans, the most tolerant of Australia's The Binary Movies, has noticed Soderberg's frequent haze of "digital storage": "You're in the forest ... You're in the forest ... You're in the forest ... ". I am also surprised that Soderberg did not give us two and a half hours of it somewhere between his current parts, because he still leaves large parts of Chi's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For an important but notorious historical biography, Soderberg falsely denies his audience, if not a deliberate insult, his masses by <br /> <br /> 1. Most of the story of Che has not been presented; /> <br /> 2. Imposing unreasonable film lengths with just boring repetition. <br /> <br /> 3. Ignore both the real backside and the story of the events; <br /> <br /> 4. Hardly develop an idea or character; <br /> <br /> 5. Remain awfully casual. <br /> <br /> 6. Ignore the context appropriate to the viewer --- everything we do is steeped in subversive time increments; <br /> <br /> 7. Displace all audiences linguistically (even Spanish speakers will be misled by unequal opponents) In English); and <br /> <br /> 8. Meaningless whitening its main theme in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The T-Shirt franchise has been a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of fearophobia is certainly due to the fact that Peter Buchmann and Benjamin Vander-Vienn are based on their scenarios only on Guevara's memoirs. So, like a poor student who has read only one of his texts dedicated to his mission, the Soderbergh product is very limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The public is held in the same restricted knowledge, landscapes and "rebel" conditions, but this does not excite our sympathy. Instead, it seems to us at dawn that "ah, Soderbergh was trying to sway his fans as the Latin peasants were doing at the time." But these are Latin peasants from the illiterate who sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderberg feel the need for equality with them, and to keep us mentally retarded? These audience restrictions must be a goal. <br /> <br /> Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it literally fools the mind with frequent bush bashing, poor outlook and lack of diversity or character arcs. Che DelToro has no chance of growing up as a person while struggling to teach his undisciplined forces. The only implication is humor, because Chi deals with sometimes ignorant "rebels", some of whom lack violence, to restrain themselves on local peasants or food. We certainly do not know the reasons for these circumstances, nor any strategic analysis of the guerrilla insurgency, as it was. <br /> <br /> The severe countdown to Part 2 is still horrified: once again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demjan Beecher) are unexpected and disturbing. Any events that have been identified are characterized by simple and central Latin, replacing the first part interviews with time-shifting meetings between corrupt Bolivian President Joaquim de Almeida and US government officials who promise to interfere with the CIA. <br /> <br /> The rest of the "jungle" in the second part of the Part2 program and the daytime blue filter angers the public until they look to the exits. <br /> <br /> DelToro may have been very excited about the frustration of many non-American Latins about not having a true and true history of Chi's influence in their country. When foreign governments still do not offer a free press to their people - for whatever reason - one can see how a popular, independent American producer can begin to lure poor reading ("I may not be able to read or write, but I am not illiterate!" - See SIGIR (1949) for their local cinemas: The obvious neglect of the film and the dramatic simplification strongly suggest that it is only intended to understand the less-known WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE book in English If they do, they have already read about the subject, Related social issues - learn history lessons as they should. <br /> <br> /> These visions are exactly what societies still need - not just the remaining Latin illiterates in Central and South America - but that is what Chi (2008) failed to achieve, and Soderberg buries his lead because he is weak in the narrative. Soderbergh deliberately planned this project if he knew it. "He was 44 years old, and the late feeling of Guevara was badly needed: I did not go to watch this film for him, but the director steals us demonic of it. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) noted that while Part1 was "uneven", Part2 was actually "rapidly declining" from there, "a sketch of Che's recent campaign in Bolivia with details Alarming ", which" ... feel it is slow and almost improbable. " <br /> <br /> Che: The Guerilla aka Part2 is definitely not a trip to Bolivia, where it paints a picture of misery and metaphysics. The entire second half is replaced only by the above-mentioned humor, pick up and perform dramatic - but tragic - to the subject of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this endless cinematic truth is just confusing and disturbing - shocking, to Soderbergh, to avoid at all costs. It is necessary to break the hearts of all who know so little about the subject (2/10)
