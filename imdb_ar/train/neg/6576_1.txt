I completely disagree with those comments that she said this is a good film. This is a full movie. I mean SOCID - SOC. The twist of the story is strange. Mia Kirchner has turned from an innocent girl into an ambitious chick for parties without convincing reasons at all. In addition, all the actresses seemed to be larger than university students - college students looked almost 30 years old. I watched only about the first ten minutes and started a quick re-search for sex scenes. All sex scenes are lame, hasty, and most importantly, not front of me at all. All sexual scenes are laughable, given the number of clothes they wear. Prefer yourself - put it and save yourself a few dollars. Conclusion: The story - 0, sex - 0, representation - 0, result - 0 out of 10.
