This happened on a dusty Sunday afternoon, and I plan to get to something else. Out of curiosity, I got to the comments here, and found myself watching them to the end. I really did not do it for purpose - it was one of those "fascinated" movies I watched "for a few minutes" until I finally saw it. And making his accusation in most of these comments more visible. The only comment that the person really admired was the result of admiration for Lad and Spano, and their previous roles. But it is not wonderful to find anywhere here - the story and performances, especially the ridiculous courtroom. We all know that Perry Mason (before passing the 300-pound Raymond Porter) and Ben Matlock give them time to roam around the courtroom, rather than being confined to a lecture. Matlock is granted in particular the privilege of entering galleries often by going to the jury and showing them, even before informing the judge and the public prosecutor or presenting them. No real judge or judge will stand in this matter. <br /> <br /> Perry and Ben have always ended the proceedings by grabbing the real killer's confession. In fact, Perry has always done so, but often, Matlock will simply provide compelling evidence of the real culprit, describing him as a "reasonable doubt," then leave it to the police and prosecutors to follow against the guilty party - sometimes on camera, presumably Sometimes at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> However, the perceptions of Holland Taylor and the amount of comfort granted to her, in the courtroom part of this story, have made the actions of Matlock / Mason very similar to the slow and often boring details such as watching on court TV And in real courtrooms. <br /> <br /> Each character in this presentation was either unclear, unfriendly, obnoxious, boring, or improbable - or a combination of two or more of these. <br /> <br /> The end was the most ridiculous, silly, and even silly conclusion - but again, it was wonderful because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. The films will appear at their best - perhaps better in the second lead roles (perhaps better if the "third"), even in this place. Taylor could be a cousin or mother of one of them. Give this one star for the story / shows, and an additional 3 for the magic factor.
