Man end of this film is terribly undesirable and dated that laughed the aesthetics of the entire film row laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film is okay. He had a few unintentionally funny scenes but he had a few good camera shots and real editing. Yes Aldrich is the great director who made Flight Of The Phoenix and whatever happened to Baby Jane and others. The problem is not in the direction or representation or anything technical. The film is only destroyed in the third chapter. why? Crimes, twists, turns and personalities all revolve around nuclear material? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came out? The way you just came out of nowhere was probably the largest Deus Ex Machina in history. Despite all the complaints about the "Planet of the Apes" in Burton, the life of David Gill or notorious, I think this is the worst at all. What fails.
