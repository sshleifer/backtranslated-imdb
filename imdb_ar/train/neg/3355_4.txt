There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was waiting for the death of Owen Wilson, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically an offer for one woman. There was Catherine Zeta-Jones only to make eye candy. Yam Neeson was completely wasted in this film. Like Jones, had no role at all. The whole movie was Lily Taylor (ransom, ready to wear). She was the only one who had any real part in this strange scenario by David Silv. Well, that was his first and replaced by Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the problem of director Jan de Bont is. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. He has already fallen into action here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise this would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
