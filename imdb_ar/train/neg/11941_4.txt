Although it breaks good jokes, but the humor is completely dry where members of the painting often draw faces or resort to the coarse language and wait for the crowd to applause enough jokes. <br /> <br /> Another comment says that I do not think this is the best RTE has ever achieved. It is really dry and cynical. The ironies are the least forms of intelligence, and there are a few funny smart gags that make you laugh really loud. People seem to be convinced of the names of famous comedians instead of judging the quality of masks that are not really good. Overall its an average with some good laugh to be but often it can be fairly average. Not as good as the Isle of Jasper or Dave Allen. I find Penny Hill more entertaining.
