If you liked the movie Grinch ... go see it again, because this was not near the translation of a good Seussian movie. Mike Myers Kat is probably the most disturbing personality to the "grace" screen recently. His voice / his tone is horrible and laughs at his jokes with a terrible annoying voice, which is the only laugh I have heard in the theater. It was not even children love this person, children laugh at anything now. Save your money and go to Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun family movie.
