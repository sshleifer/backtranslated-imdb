They should have dubbed this movie: "Adopted a brother's mouse is somewhat inspired by the memories of a mysterious person about Little Stewart who was just a kind of skimmer little book, but mostly remembered only the cover" If it was not too misleading it's a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, do your children and ask them to read the book. They may actually learn something rather than drown their minds with what we all know as a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart little is not about the mouse, but about a very small person and the mouse like. He was born to his parents, not adopted. The book revolves around his life, his final departure from the house and the journey he begins. There's a cat called Snowball who thinks he eats and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> In the film, all this proves. I think the only things they kept from the book were boat races and names.
