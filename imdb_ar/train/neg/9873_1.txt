I watched it with my mom and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We did not get it at all. I may be wrong, but the chair had to do with the death of this woman's father. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who like a thrill movie well. A bad movie thrill! * Shake canes in the film * I do not see it again. I am a big fan of old movies, too! They need to stop trying to make films. It drove me to madness !!! <br /> <br /> Whit was ugly however, she loved him more than Hugh, which was very beautiful looking. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
