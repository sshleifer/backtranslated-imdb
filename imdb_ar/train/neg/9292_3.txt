First of all, I was also expecting another hero - a wonderful work of art for movement. I've only seen parts of the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon game, but I can imagine that it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of the Hero are found in HoFD: great landscapes, fantastic cinematography, and sincere behavior (I mean, if you can not understand a word they say, without subtitles, but you still care - that's a good thing) /> <br /> What's wrong? What begins with political intrigues wandering around in a love story. Worse still, it's like opera love and soap. You have three characters, I think, fall in love with each other - without any good reasons. This film basically breaks down after jailbreak (I've been out of bed for forty minutes). It seems as though they changed the book at that point. The rest of the film revolves around how character is "like the wind." I. Also, you really have to extend the suspension of your disbelief until you believe the specific pieces of work. This is not unique, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for the procedure, and then, when fighting breaks out, this was not really good. The first grabs you, but then the gas runs out.
