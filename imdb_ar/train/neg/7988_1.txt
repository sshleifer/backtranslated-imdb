Anita and I seem to be more than just an excuse for Lama Sial, the author of the novel and the script, to express her biases, grievances and public hatred of English. The general sentiment of Indian superiority over English in this film is foul. <br /> <br /> The English people are depicted in this film as overweight, violent, oral, indirect, childless, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, poor, But by switching to Indian culture only, the local priest can be "recovered" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the Indian family is beautiful, intelligent and educated, and can speak many languages, caring and loving parents, and school feed rules. The film is so damaging that I am surprised that the BBC has ever funded it. Had it been in the opposite direction, an English family would have been portrayed in an Indian society this way, the film would have been considered racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrows fired up my forehead, I thought it would be a lodge in my hair. First, the gossip scene among women in celebration Divali - expression: dirty and mixed English - and man - expression: English women prostitutes. Second, eat the meal with Anita where the Nima family lies about tableware - Interpretation: English is very stupid, and you can make it do anything. <br /> <br /> But the main contempt for anything in English - even English weddings are an object of disdain - obviously along the way through the film. Anita's character was painted in a very terrifying way - almost the woman's cup that fell - so much so that I finished the film and felt angry. <br /> <br /> This is not "bending like Beckham," where humor focuses on the love of exaggerating society's behavior and habits from someone within this community, a film about two girls from different backgrounds who meet. Instead, Anita and I seem to have conveyed that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, because English is almost a copy of the indestructible Indian class, and this is confirmed by a series of veiled attacks on the "other" film community ": English. <br /> <br /> Anita and I felt a piece of work filled with hatred and grievance. On this basis, the BBC should not finance its production.
