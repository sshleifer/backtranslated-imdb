The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from the thin plot of tissue, weak texts, melancholy representation and funny continuity in liberating this chaos together. It has a few memorable moments, but the well dries quickly. When I was a kid, I remember it as a warm way for Luke to represent comedian artists, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was moved in each scene and how this was related to the scheme in general. Watch it again after many years, it screams schlock-a-mania. I am not very interested in the racial controversy, since I do not mind seeing a film about this issue with a bit of a fuss. The most obvious mistake for me is that the viewer has been placed as a mixed and non-connected series of two-minute comedy bits (ie not very good at it), which were stapled together by the editor after all in the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motives on a dime, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and within scenes, making this feeling as if no one had any idea what could emerge from a script. This is not any gem to begin with. I feel bad for the actors who have inherited this disaster that should never have happened. Perhaps my sense of humor is very refined ...
