When I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought every horror film she had and was one of them. VCR'S has become a household element and we only had about 150 films and we saw all hell. <br /> <br /> I was in the yard selling that day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I bought any horror film I do not have and I know that this movie looks familiar. I thought for a second and realized that my sister had chosen it. I've been selling it for years in a yard that I guess they guess - who knows. <br /> <br /> I never remembered anything about it and watched it the night I bought it and made my memory of some of the scenes. I'm not sure how I feel about it as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I was watching and enjoying it at the time. <br /> <br /> I'm very weird, but there are certain requirements to be considered "good" and this is very short. One of these modern words was speech and gave birth to the types of death. What death scenes you see using the shadow on the wall followed by blood spots, and if you're lucky, you'll get that much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I have seen a few of them with similar schemes, so I think this should be buried and forgotten. You do not see this people unless you are difficult to reach.
