This is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I like Japanese movies, I think another film of the same director, 80,000 volt electric dragon, is a wonderful masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - Asano was a wonderful actor and the movie story was very attractive. But I found nothing interesting about him. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever without anything happening. The influences the director used - such as the constant rhythm and heavy use of slow motion - added only to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was too slow, and the actors were exaggerating too much. Much of the boredom was due to strange additions that were not absolutely necessary - like an hour spent cutting off the Buddha statues and declaring how nothing was worshiped. This has added nothing to the plot. Orange fellow Japanese film and you both constantly check the time. We could not believe that this film was as terrible as it was. The ending was awful. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for his management to find out, but unfortunately I was wrong.
