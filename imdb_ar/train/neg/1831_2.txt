I usually love comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I do not really understand "envy." I mean it contains a boring content / theme, which is not really funny. <br /> <br /> Although acting is generally good, it is not enough to have the movie at least a little fun. Stiller & Black does not show all their talents in this film. <br /> <br /> So, if you're going to rent a comedy, I definitely suggest you do not go to this movie. Unless you want to be bored, I can see that I am not the only one in this view, because even Jack Black apologized for it (take a look at Trivia).
