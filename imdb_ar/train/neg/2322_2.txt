I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie, being a huge fan who I find, and found it to be a great disappointment. Kurt Russell was most of the "Alves moves" down and the sound tradition was wonderful, but the voice of the lyric bloggers in Alves did not work for me. The sound did not always match the mouth of Russels, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was remarkable. Also, there were many amazing contradictions in the film. People who do not know much about Elvis may think they are facts. His songs sing earlier than recorded in real life, at the time he got his first guitar, I am quite sure that his brother Jesse Garon has been buried in an unmarked tomb, not one of the great grave witnesses reads JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they went through important events, like special rehearsals, and pulled out some scenes for a very long time. If you want to see a good movie Elvis appears in his main rent, this is the case, or another Elvis concert. Hearing and seeing the real composition is the only way to truly see his talent. (A fantastic statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good flic fic.)
