It's a lousy film, but I have to give it to the lead actress in this film ... Francine Forbes. They seemed to be acting at the very least and I personally thought it was nice. Too bad, only appear in one movie in the database. In addition, the film is filled with scenes of false and ridiculous death. People are stabbed as they go like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you want to watch poor horror movies, I highly recommend this.
