It's a great team, but the film is not near the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for a great movie should visit the original movie. William Messi may be one of the greatest actors who lives with us, but here he has not benefited much from him. His role was originally Marcelo Mastroiani, so I regret his attempt to fill those shoes. You may also try to imitate Bogart or Young de Niro. The direction of the art is rich and textured but does not bring anything to the story, the extra bits they add to the story are absolutely unnecessary and the things they take are lost. So starting out the way they do seems unjustified and takes a surprise from the original text. Sam Rockwell enjoys his strange and gentle charm, and Luis Guzman enjoys this exotic charisma, but part of the love story in the film seems strange and unstable. It's very bad, no one knows how to make this film, it was first produced, but again, it's very bad that we live in a culture where we feel we need to rework the amazing things rather than just learning to taste the originals.
