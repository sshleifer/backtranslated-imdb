The only reason I got to record this movie is that I live in Cleveland and Shack are playing basketball for us now and 2. The film did not disappoint me. The best parts were the shack clothes. The worst parts were, well, about everything else. My 12-year-old son and I were only smeared and could not look at the screen when Shack started rapping, and we wondered why Max did not want Kazem to fix his front tooth! But even though it is not desirable that we could not stop watching it, the story absorbed you, like a black hole, moving sand or a tar hole. But it was worth it for laughing and just saying we already saw "Kazzam".
