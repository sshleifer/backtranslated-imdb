An interesting addition to the Casbah oblique course that dominated the horror genre of the 1980s. The film was filmed as "The Prank" but it was released as "The Dwelling That Died," a clear theft from the 1970 horror anthology The House Dale Dam. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face in the cast, and this was her first horror film (also featured in The Initiation and The Fly II).
