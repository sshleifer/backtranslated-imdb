All David Forward movies are awesome in all respects: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (usually the director's brother is the male actor). But they all have amazing entertainment value because of their unintended joy. The plot of almost every film "David Pre" (as I like to point out) is essentially the same. The American commandos all conspire to blow up the Communist bad guys. But unlike other cold-war litter-like Red Dawn, Prior's movies are already funny because of their super buildings and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Gen. Mitchell Baker (or the other man?) Is called on to do a very secret mission in South America. Then the edge of the line is delivered in the film, which is impressive "This is my roommate, I have trained him well." What. Have you trained your roommate? This seems to be a solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems on the video used anywhere, buy them. They are all funny and even entertaining after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends to experience a real MST3K style. So far, I and my friends have been able to get a comment from Night Wars and Aerobicide nicknamed "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most is "the final penalty", with the strange Robert Zadar.
