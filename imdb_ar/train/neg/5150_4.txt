I got the DVD from the library hoping to get a good idea of ​​how things went in the background in a great opera production. I must say, I was very disappointed. The subject had a lot of potential. Wagnerian production groups must, necessarily, be complex and impressive and the story behind their creation and use can be an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we get is a large group of people moving around large elements of the landscape, mysteriously helping with a comment that failed to attract my attention. I found myself listening primarily to the background music of the opera. I was impressed by the sheer magnitude of the effort required to produce such production - which appeared fairly well and next time I'm at the opera - I'm sure I'll remember this part if this video - but I left feeling somewhat cheated because of the lack of detailed explanation and explanation.
