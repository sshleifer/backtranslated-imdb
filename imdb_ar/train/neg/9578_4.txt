Can A-Pix do anything right at all? This movie should have been seen on the TV in letterbox format. Since A-Pix does not insure panning and scanning, we see full scenes where the shoulder speaks on the left side of the screen to the shoulder on the right side. Of course, you do not miss much. This movie is very bad. It's very hard to enjoy a movie where characters in the top of her lungs scream in 80% of the film for no reason.
