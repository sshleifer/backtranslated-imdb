The film is acting really well, but the film is very slow and very boring, once everything becomes interesting it slows down considerably. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, as did the other actors as I mentioned but the guy ... this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now perhaps in the form of a short film this film will be good, but otherwise, avoid it. This film contains a great deal of padding because it makes the Twinkie cake giraffe. <br /> <br /> I have never directed films before, but I watched this movie at home with my family. Yes, it was boring. My comment does not appear to contain enough lines to post, so here are some additional fillings. I think I'm inspired by the film I just saw.
