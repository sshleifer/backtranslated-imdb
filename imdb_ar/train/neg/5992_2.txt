The most critical moments in this film are when Brady Corbett says "I thrived", near the end of the film. She died in practice. I'm still not sure why the scriptwriter put this line there. Was it supposed to create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbird, but Thunderbird had the ability to do a lot. This film does not. If it does not have a large debit card for the Thunderbirds brand, it would have been directly converted to TV, or canned in post production. Maybe before that. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits expire and play the song Busted "Thunderbirds are go". I can not believe I lost $ 7 in watching this through pay-per-view.
