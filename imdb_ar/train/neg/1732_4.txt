Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous bisexuals in history, and they deserve it, so I'm happy to see any of their films. Basically a man in a horn factory is the fourth to crack, and soon enough cracks are made with every horn noise. He is resting at home with Stan next to him, needs quiet, and Doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he will come to check out the service. After one of the reformers realized plumbing and electricity, the doctor went into a medical examination. After some tests, he recommended drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air in the ocean. After Stan played some trumpet, hung out the window through the phone cord and crashed the car, he and I made a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the sidewalk trying goat's milk, and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the front page of the newspaper reads that the murderer Nick Granger - convicted of escape (Richard Kramer) has fled, sneaks into the boys' boat while they sleep, chews the goat through the boat rope, and drifts to the sea. In the morning, he saw their site, and Killer came out demanding something to eat. Stan and his friend discovered that he was making fake food, for example a chain for spaghetti, cheese soap, bacon belt, sponge for meatballs, and forcing them to eat it. When he starts to choke on something, Stan strikes his horn to help, and raises his anger at beating the killer, and it continues until police arrive, just to make them angry from prison in prison. There were smaller moments of comedy, but it was not a great black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice mess I got!" He was number 60 in 100 years, 100 quotes, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were ranked 7th on comedians comedians. Okay!
