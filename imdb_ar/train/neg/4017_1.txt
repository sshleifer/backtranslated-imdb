Yes, this film has a lot of interest and is considered classic in adult movies. However, I did not like this at all. About a woman who committed suicide in a scene more appropriate to a horror film, she was given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live a life of lust she had never done before in her mundane life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they crazy, because they are trying so hard to be technical that they are robbing the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for no sex. Little Girls Blue does things in an artistic way, but it's still very exciting and fun to look at. Of course the girls in this very cute. Here our lead actress is somewhat unattractive and this does not help things. If you find that the lead in your adult movie is unattractive, there is not much artistic vision that will make me enjoy the movie. Sex scenes range from yuck to weird ... I mean there is a snake in one of them people. To me, this film fails only because it does not excite me at all, but it quits my appetite.
