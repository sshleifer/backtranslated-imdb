For shame, it's a shame that a good actor like Joseph Vines will allow himself to cast in this outrageous game. The film was not only bad but was very bad and not good. The plot, (there was one?) Seemed to not go anywhere. Russians play silly games kill or kill, and should advertise that the rest of the actors Lagoon and Lagoon because of their pathetic performance. I gave up about 3/4 of the road and turned it off. "1" is just awful because there is nothing less. Do not waste your time in this one, you will not miss anything.
