Represents the three-dimensional in the "man who did not exist" DUMB, DUMB and DUMB! This ineffective comedy features poor 3D effects that make 3D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th Part 3" look better compared. Not to mention that the film is needed. This was one of the 1983 movies that displays pop-up screen effects. Steve Gothenburg and Jeffrey Tambour have fallen into this mess, but at least they have not killed their careers. Tambor will star in "The Larry Sanders Show" for HBO and Ron Howard's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg continues this flop with "Police Police" and "Cocoon". What they have in these projects instead of them here in "the man who was not there." If you do, you'll regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
