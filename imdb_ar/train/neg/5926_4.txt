Another weak entry in the third season, "Is there really no beauty?" However, there is at least one major master plan element that is completely different and, as Spock says, it is wonderful. The main character is an alien who must be carried in a black box because his appearance is so horrible that it drives people crazy. It's a very bad episode that can not live up to this incredible assumption. Obviously, I think it was a mistake to "show" the alien at all, since his actual vision does not in any way coincide with such a massive accumulation; all we get is the Star Trek light narcotic screen used in any number of things in loops Different, usually when the ship passes through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, at least the appearance of Colos can be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and only then if Spock wears a special mask. (For the longest time, I thought the name of the foreigner was "Carlos", which I found funny, but I go on.) Spock is asked to deal with Colos at some point so that the alien can experience the project back to safety. This was achieved, but when Spock / Kollos returns to finish thinking, by Golly, Spock forgets his mask. Ah, he is crazy but he is finally recovering with the help of a colossus, a blind woman with psychic abilities. This is probably a really weird and excellent episode, but it's not badly directed, and it's one of the most poorly executed programs of the series last season.
