Tip I think it may be collected through various comments on the subject. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the number of people who liked this movie and wanted to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory". <br /> <br /> I think this gives us an insight into why this movie is so compelling and the issue behind it is very polarized. <br /> <br /> The cause of global warming is much liking for people who want to force others to "do the right". It appeals in particular to people who are more "liberal" because it has nothing to do with the ethics of the bedroom, which makes conservatives usually want to force you to "be good." <br /> <br /> This is a problem in the movie. Al Gore is a politician. One very successful at it. He can not help himself by appealing to those who want to force others to do what they want. The political appeal is too big. <br /> <br /> There is a scientific issue that may be of great importance, limited to a political issue that appeals to those in the political body with tendencies to force others to "do the right thing". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how these people hijacked the environmental movement?
