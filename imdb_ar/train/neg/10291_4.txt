80 minutes, I felt twice this long time! Brief crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes of dialogue consists almost (more than just a monologue) of a woman approaching middle age, recounting the "man", disappointment, sex, aging, and recent separation from a teenage French woman who met at the cafeteria of the ship . <br /> <br /> The boring monologue continues when they go to the duty-free shop and to the bar, where it finally pays it self-involved. Of course, the "story" can not end there, so she convinces him to listen to her drones because she brings him to her cabin. <br /> <br /> What a love story or sex or little of the matter. , There is absolutely nothing in this film besides a bitter scream that is not enough to justify the rent price unless you are one of those who love drama where there is nothing interesting at all. Yes, the finish is very well done, but it is a great reward to subdue yourself to what converts to transform your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic hideout. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like it. I might be wrong.
