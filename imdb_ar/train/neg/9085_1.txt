One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The representation was terrible, both for children and adults. Most showed to all the characters do not, little emotion or not enough. The lighting was terrible, and there was a lot of chaos around the time of the day the film was filmed (in the river scene where only their boat was destroyed, there are 4 shots; the commander and father in the evening on their boat, Gillian and Molly in the evening bragging, * The best representation in the film was probably from the chief of police, Cappy (although there is a slip in the personality when the pulse detector is * No matter what this thing is when people die, it makes a sound * shows that Cappy has died, but it still remains He moves while he can still hear a voice, and while the additional nurse checks his pulse manually, it shows the pulse again, then eventually dies.) I think it will not be perfect, because it's an independent film, but it's still better. Not worth watching, frankly, even for kids. You may also see something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story if you see anything you remember.
