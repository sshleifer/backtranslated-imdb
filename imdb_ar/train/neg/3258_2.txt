DOC SAVAGE: Bronze Man (1 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Awesome movie, awesome ... based on the pulp series / paperback magazine of Lester Dent / Kenneth Robson ... about the heroic heroism of the adventurous hero of the 1930s and his aides The five, all experts in a certain area of ​​the efforts that allow them to fight evil. It was a beautiful hockey series ... but it was fun when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie in the seventies from Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I did not get a chance to see him. He never played in theaters where he lived and never appeared on television. Now that I have finally watched the film, I can understand why. The plot and the characters are never treated seriously ... it's a kind of cheek and tongue ... like a series of old Batman TV series ... just without being funny ... or having any visual taste. Stupid dialogue, cheesy special effects, stupid stereotypes, open action scenes, bad and bad works. In fact, I find it impressive in a bad situation ... what could they think? Arnold Schwarzenegger was reportedly playing a major role in a new edition in modern times ... but I do not imagine that would have been much better.
