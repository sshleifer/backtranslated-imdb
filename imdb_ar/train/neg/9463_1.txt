Means lacking the spirit of adaptation, and down humiliating adjustment right in the classic children's tale not only the charm of her ancestors but lacking any talent what ever. Mike Myers should not be ashamed of himself only for his terrible performance which is tantamount to a clear tear to what Jim Carrey did but must give up acting together. It's so annoying that you want to overcome the crap out of it if you are able to jump into the movie. The groups are ugly and filming is very bad. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but it's not just the cake, it's the worst film I've ever made.
