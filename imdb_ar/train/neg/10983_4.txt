When this play was first shown by the BBC for more than 30 years, it was quite different at the moment. So some people found it very scary, and maybe they were impressed with the special effects? <br /> <br /> When you look at the play in this day and age, it does not seem all that scary anymore, so special effects can leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Is the train really allowed to pass RED LIGHT to a dark tunnel? I do not think so ... but if you see this play again, you will notice that the first train entering the tunnel, rushing directly through RED LIGHT! (Perhaps this was the case in the time of the barracks)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the pedestrian passage leading to the Sign Box is very steep and in poor condition. There will definitely be a series of appropriate steps with the handrail for Signalman to climb up or down in pieces. (I can only point to things like that). <br /> <br /> I will not get anything out of the act. Both Denholm Elliott and Bernhard Lloyd (the traveler) have made great performances. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not sure at all what's going on ...... I mean the ghost traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really understand this somewhat confusing story ??? (Well, maybe I'm the only one who does) ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ..... <br /> <br /> The play has a wonderful atmosphere all around character. It's not scary at all these days, and it's a bit if not too confusing in some places, and it has some unusual signal practices .... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading my review.
