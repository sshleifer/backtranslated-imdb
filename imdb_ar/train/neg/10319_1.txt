Unlike many, I do not find the premise or subject of this offer is the least offensive. Its implementation, however, is quite another matter. Like many B-minus movies, it seems that all decent gags have been divided into trailers. For most of the 22 minutes or so, we sit down waiting for a drop of real humor. Or at least something that prevents one from manipulating carpet fibers remotely or counting. With some exceptions, it's terrible. The excessive emotions and gestures of some team members may be quite appropriate for late-night advertising, but it is not an early comic (even Canadian) play. Although the original cultural angle is recognized, I can not help but think that they misled the fire by CBC to replicate the success of the gas corner. Unfortunately, they got the tone - and the text - completely sinful with regard to the promoter. The last insult is that it is clear that they can not even afford the cost of implementing the site in a real small town (why? S hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Do they think the public will be fooled by outsiders in downtown Regina? As a proud Canadian, I hope this thing soon disappears, and the rest of the world, prepared by CBC advertising executives, will forget this tremendous embarrassment of the sitcom.
