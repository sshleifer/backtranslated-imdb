I rented this movie for a few laughs. I have never seen a SNL play, but with successes like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it was not bad, was it? Answer: It was. This film was hardly a way to relax after a hard day at work. I kept waiting for a landline and a funny part, but there was nothing. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Tyson, and that's just about it.
