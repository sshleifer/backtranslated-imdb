I took this film in a small show organized by the members of the club in my college. We warned that this would be a "justified madness" for the games, and this film was more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who is re-starting his university career after "resting" half a year. What we discover as the film progresses is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game he recognizes after a group of games has recruited him to campaign. <br /> <br /> This movie is laughable on many levels. One scene includes a "candlelight play" set, which may be the best way to describe it. Although I'm sure this was meant to be "culturally" in a way, as most players know, they are terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions are performed in well-lit rooms, usually on some chihyx fingers and a can of soft drinks. <br /> <br /> Acting, although not an Oscars, is not great. This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party is still a year or two in sight. Supporters, though not forgetting, are still making good offers. <br /> <br /> Basically, the problem lies in the fact that it was a TV-specific movie showing "The dangers of the games" Worth a show whether you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
