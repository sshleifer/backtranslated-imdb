While I was watching this movie I was thinking, well, you'll get better at any moment ... I was wrong. The best real part of this film was when it ended. A complete waste for 92 minutes. All the seriousness was the best part when the Wendigo team finally appeared, which was in the end and you could not see well. The tail end was really kind of dumb as well. There were a lot of passages in the film where you thought something would happen but it was failing. The worst part is that there was more talk about Wendigo then there was Wendigo. In order for the creature to be so bad, you can not definitely tell by this movie.
