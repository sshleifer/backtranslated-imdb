I watched this movie for two hours and have absolutely no idea what it is about. Someone killed or maybe did not and maybe someone did it or maybe they did not. This brought back the memories of the old days (old days?) When all Canadian CBC films were stinky. In recent times, inhalation has been the exception, but this blurred version of contemporary women's movements, the tumultuous phenomena and the mysterious dialogue make up for lost time. Margaret Atwood's books were not easy to read. This film is still this fine Canadian tradition. Not easy to watch. Modern people at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties may pretend to be impressed. People in our boonies are a little less buzz.
