from where we start? What about the wrong summary: <br /> <br /> "Origins of X-Men: Wolverine tells the story of Wolfin's violent and emotionally violent past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the fateful Weapon X program." <br /> <br /> His emotionally violent past turns out to be exceptionally exceptional. <br /> <br /> His relationship with the Creed is very complicated because it is difficult to understand how it is ever associated. From one point in the opening scene we are seen as children fleeing, to a series of scenes of war they have fought throughout their long lives, and finally to the present where they are part of a government team of hardcore murderers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing by showing their relationship as brothers at all. There is nothing complex that we have to believe is real or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the movie was suddenly forced between Silverfox and Wolverine. We throw romance so quickly that it ends before you can blink an eye. After the personal presentation, Silverfox was killed after about 15 minutes. We have left wondering why we should care about this. Who were they anyway? <br /> <br /> For the central element of this weak story, which is paid for revenge, romance is not surprisingly explored. The urgency was simply because it was required. <br /> <br /> It is strange that when Wolverine finds that his love is dead, he leaves it in the forest to rot as he moves to find Saberoth. Being a romantic, it was not appropriate for him, but it is necessary so far to serve the plot to make a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the X weapons program, let's say that after the painful paralysis of Wolverine's procedure is up and running. Eventually it reaches the home of a very comfortable and very deep old couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not worried about finding a sweaty man in their barn. Is it surprising what fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous movies and comic books, the main cause of his memory loss was his vivernes partly dependent on the fact that he was said to be very wicked and coldblooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this was the case ... did he really want to remember such atrocities or keep them hidden and continue his current most positive lifestyle in fighting against the bad guys in the world along with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As X2: X-men United hints at when Stryker gives up some of his secrets, Wolverine is said to be upset if he knows the evil things they have done together. This film sets the team up fairly well, but they do not do much. No annoying violence, no harsh acts, they harass some indigenous people in foreign lands for ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead he was constantly trying to put the leash on his brother Sabertooth and who was therefore the violent client we all thought Wolverine was. In the end, everyone leaves together. <br /> <br /> There is no contradiction in duplication here at all. <br /> <br /> The stupidity of this conflict between good and evil has gone awry. They may have given him a rubber stamp. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of other errors in this movie that contradicted the trio of men, including the introduction of one of Deus Ex Machinas's labyrinth ever hit by a script. <br /> <br /> The magic of lead erase memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> It seems to be the only thing that drops Wolverine. However, this seems to have been forgotten when a client was sent after a client to drop it with bullets and bombs that would definitely not work on it at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in tons of other mutants that did little at all. Interesting characters were just dressing up in the window and did nothing for the story. Most of them were in the movie for a maximum of 5 to 10 minutes, yet you find yourself wishing we had seen more of them and a bit of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Blob but not the comic version can launch a tank missile with little or no physical damage, but a simple head of the Wolverines metal arm is enough to dazzle it. <br /> <br /> Visual cyclops (which instead of being a concussion force are now closer to laser beams burning in buildings, but when you shoot the saberoth directly, they simply break it down on the ground without damaging the clothes. <br /> <br /> The manipulated maneuver (which defies gravity), instead of using his signature cards, was made in the form of a crazy acrobat.In one of the scenes that was badly edited, Wolverine lost consciousness. And then amazingly after a few minutes, he was on the roof of a building running the Wolverine TOWARDS.How he regained consciousness, fled a few blocks, climbed a building, then returned to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of the scratching game is a mystery that has not been explained yet. <br /> <br /> Some have excused this film's weakness by claiming that it is made of a comic and therefore must be weak in character and the weight of the flash. Flimsy and superficial because of this fact is not true. <br /> <br /> Comic source material, the origin of REAL for Wolverine ... is a story that deserves to be displayed on screen, does not break his past and does not treat the reader like the crazy CGI addicts. It's a well-written story and although it has been rewritten and modified over time, I started with WEAPON X from Barry Windsor Smith. The story is more intense and exciting. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be forgotten seriously. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
