You know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, do not rent this movie. If you want to take a look at a documentary film about Cover Life, you're in the wrong place too. If you are looking for a funny movie, this is a real winner! The representation is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is certainly the officer who achieves leadership. I can say that he made a 911 voice as well as his flat tone. If you can hear a cardboard box talk, it may sound like a man. Oh yes, and the zombie made a better impression of a snake and is on par with the general imagination that behaves in general (note the irony ... how he did not win an Oscar for best make-up) The Quiroz ...... did not do any kind Of the directive. I felt like I was seeing an improvised piece of time (the period is like Los Angeles in the 1990s). But the trend was worse than the worst scenario I think it would ever draw a film. I did not hear such beautiful lines, like the epic word that begins with "F ** k!" , Since Ice Grill was another civil film. This only works of course with hip-hop soundtracks too! All 3 or so songs from it! All in all, what the hell would you expect from a movie called "The Dead Dead Hood"? I rented this movie with the full intention that I would laugh at every scene, a boy threw it and more! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to meet with a group of guys and laugh at the low budget horror film (yeah right ...) at night. Definitely a memorable experience!
