This film is a rewrite of Warren Beatty's 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait", but written for the comic style of Mr. Rock's position. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before the end of his life and is working on an agreement with the representative of God, Mr. King, to return to earth as someone else. As in Betty's film, Charles Willington, a rich white man, chose all this because he fantasizes Sonty Jenkins (Regina King) who happens when he comes to Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Ms. Wellington and her lover suffers in this new release and the idea of ​​transforming a millionaire aged from a millionaire to a black comedy actor standing in an attempt to attract Sontee simply does not work. The intercuts used to show Rock Wellington as Wellington as "White" real, fail miserably. It was possible to make improvements to my original Betty scheme - which in itself was not portrayed with the idea of ​​a post-mortal life brilliantly - but certainly not found in "back to earth."
