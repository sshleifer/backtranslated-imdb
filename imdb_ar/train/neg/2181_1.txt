I've seen this movie thinking it would be an old B movie that you can watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and obviously targeted at males who like to look at physical women. The story was so absurd and absurd that it completely lost my interest. It seems to be in the same kind of Ed Wood movies - down the barrel.
