Luke Benward (11 years old) is very sensitive (as Billy "Form Boy" Forster moves) to a new town. In his new school, young people are chosen by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. In order to control his hand, Benward threw a worm at Adam Hicks, a freckle-faced freckle (like Joe Guire). Sensible bets can eat 10 worms in one day - without scaling! <br /> <br /> Halle Kate Eisenberg (like Erica "Erk" Tanse) long and skillful uses her shooting skills to help Beneward. SCTV's former director and director, Bob Dolman, said: "No worms were made from this film." In a related note, SCTV and Andrea Martin has one funny scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely built on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Pre-teen children should enjoy the film. <br /> <br /> *** How to Eat Fried Worms (8/25/06) Bob Doleman ~ Luke Penneward, Adam Hicks, Halle Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gold
