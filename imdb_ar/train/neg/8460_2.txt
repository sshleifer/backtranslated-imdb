This film was hired only because of the promises of William Davao and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that when you see the RR name on the cover (as an actor), this movie will be good. It looks like a film made by Rodriguez, if he will give his name, should it be good? Rong Rong Rong. Is by far the worst release since "Manos Hands of Fate". The way it was edited makes no sense and make the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you will not want to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Davo and Rodriguez were involved in this film, and perhaps they deserved someone, but they are two ways to do it. Besides they were only in this movie for a few minutes each and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to watch a movie with a weak edit, misrepresentation, and a more confusing story than to be my guest, but do not say you are not warned.
