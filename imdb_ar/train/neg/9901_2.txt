This was supposed to be a single star, but there were a lot of cliches and spikes that could be predicted, and we saw all that before the falling flick equaled that I actually gave him an extra star for the fact that he made me laugh ... although this did not I never intended directors Im sure. <br /> <br /> I do not write comments about movies often; they must either be dramatic or in this very bad situation. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahi, I knew he would be poor because he had a unique nose to take the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I made a farce of it all of me watching it all the way, maybe for the funny voice of MR T, (not Mr. T's transfer, but you'll know what I mean if you're interested in watching this), if you see it , Make sure you do not pay for seeing it. Maybe this has succeeded in putting the comedy in it, but I'm sure you'll find strange laughter here and there in the farce of everything ...
