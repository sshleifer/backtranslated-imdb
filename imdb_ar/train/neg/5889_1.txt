First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the boring emotional films of the 1970s and 1980s, the films of this place actually began to contain a little humor. Imagine .. I made an actual comedy! Films actually began to get fun and entertainment, unlike long, dark, depressing and boring films. <br /> <br /> During the 1990s and 1980s, many truly great films were produced by a "new generation" of directors. Critics praised the film after the film and played a lot of money. This is becoming the norm! <br /> <br /> Then came United ... <br /> <br /> * Little spoilers * It's simply not funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... we think it's funny. Because we used to Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with such representatives with a few really funny comedians. But .. do not say and do not do anything funny! Where is humor? Show me the humor! Is he the embarrassing writer played by Harald Eya? Is he an exaggerated football player that is absolutely unrealistic and ridiculous? Are the comments written by Arne Scheie? The movie is not funny! <br /> <br /> But this is not my main concern for United. This is the predictability. (Here I am afraid that the Norwegian comedy has stopped since I saw this in many other films as well). All the time you know it will end well. All the characters are exactly as they are shown at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There is no room for surprises at all! <br /> <br /> Overall, I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after watching this movie. This was the only film that made me realize that we might need some new blood in the Norwegian film industry ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
