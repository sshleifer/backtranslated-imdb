.... because if I were, I wish I were crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to pinpoint this movie plot - and I'm "gracious" that there was even a conspiracy to start it out. As we mentioned previously, it is wrong to label a DVD cover that Richard Dreyfus is actually a star. It was barely in the film. If he is already "frustrated" as the back cover has shown, it is probably because he said yes in a film disaster and could not get out of it! It seems that the film really focuses on Jared Martin, and what his role in the film, unlike the radical confidants, was not supposed to be too great for the mystery of Jean Barry's role in fact - or not. And talk of "big" ... Anyone who had a bright idea to fit Jean Barry in a Hampte Dembte, which showed his trousers that were literally pulled up to his chin, must be sentenced to a tough time by watching this movie stoned with stones. I can continue to talk about how wonderful this film is, from a dialogue that does not match the mouths of "actors" (I think Clutch Cargo) to the erroneous jump from one scene to another (again, to be generous even calling picture frames) , To the lack of a plot .... However, if you are in the bad kind of the early seventies and if you are in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of Kid & Kat pictures, I recommend eating a good bottle of wine before embarking on this exotic trip to the movie Because you will be grateful that you may not remember the next day!
