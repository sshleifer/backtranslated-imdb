... from this terrible film! There are many wrong things in this film, acting, writing, directing, editing, etc. It's amazing that something is rising to the top and proves to be the worst. Music! I noticed that the film has two composers listed. This must be the reason that each frame has its own music, for the worst drives the absolute "D" style movies. They never heard the words "less is more". I had a very painful voice, mute every time there was no dialogue, and not that dialogue was good. You should feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they have not seen such roles in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own risk.
