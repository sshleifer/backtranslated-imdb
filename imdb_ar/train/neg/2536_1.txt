My wife and I just finished watching Bsusu AKA The Booth. I fell asleep during some parts of the film. I really wish I had been overlooked with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character was so loud and so hard that it was impossible to sleep. When our protagonist talks, he makes me want to hear Regis Philip and William Schattner singing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I had hoped the bus would crash five minutes into the film. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me, I love the Asian Horror Cinema, but The Booth is very annoying and full of scenes that really are damn damn horrible at all. If you want some good Asian cinema, check out the story of two sisters or in the mirror. Avoid a stall like a plague, especially if you are suffering from frequent migraines.
