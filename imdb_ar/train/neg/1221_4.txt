I remember the days when Kim Basinger was only a pretty face decorating the movies with typical characters from stupid blondes or romantic interest or girl at risk. But everything changed when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one surprised by her strong performance. However, after that moment, her career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the position she won with this film made her take part in fairly prestigious films (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we never saw her again on a big character. The film while she is out does nothing to put it into this position; it is not only that her character is not very delicious, but also that the film is really ingenious. Scenario Scenario of this film can not be more hollow and basic. However, Basinger brings some condemnation to her character, and this makes her poor film to win a few points. This film is full of clich√©s and general villains. The work of director Susan Montford is truly catastrophic for many reasons but mainly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this film is ridiculous. I would not recommend it while it was outside at all. This film commits the great sin of being boring.
