I never heard of this before the local DVD salesman reminded me of it. It was a flick of the 1980s because of the famous discrimination that was banned in the UK. I decided to check it out. The film turned into a boring, amateurish and ugly journey. Voice recording is so weak that dialogue is not understood half the time, while acting gives a new meaning to the word incompetent! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the film follows the horrifying formula of three adolescent girls who participate in an accident and find themselves protected by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and has never heard of it again; another, still suffering from over-bedding, is quickly disposed of (after forgetting most of the time). It is the heroine who interacts most with the three inhabitants of the house: Haridan from the mother of the gospel (an appalling cue), her suppressed daughter (and long-suffering), and the last eccentric brother who sometimes appears on the scene that slams the sleeping inmates. <br /> <br /> Often the memories of the man's table at the dinner table (as a means of filling the depression, to say nothing of non-original, behind the scenes) and constantly evolving into contests between mother and daughter, the film has one cover - The twisting party is as unexpected as it is creative, but it does little to remove the bad taste left by the film in the mouth (as much as by limping everything as an intermittent surprise) or an inevitable feeling of wasting 80 minutes of my time ...
