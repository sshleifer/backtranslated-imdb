Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I think that if a teenager wants to become a Torah with another teenager, this is their eternal curse - just remember the children, "birth control" does not mean "oral sex" I do not care what the senior student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's help considers himself a "romantic man", he still hits a girl in high school only. If she was my sister, I would eat these young people on her knees. <br /> <br /> Besides, I found out that the Mongols do not accept the same way the French do and the baseball players call the zoo like the fine underwear. <br /> <br /> I think I was watching Richie Rich once instead of suffering from this slap, slap and slap. Thanks and become good.
