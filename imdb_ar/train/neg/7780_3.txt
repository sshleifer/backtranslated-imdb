I could hardly stop any gesture or stop the faeces, but I decided to cancel it just because something might have happened. This is the work of the writer / producer / director / private forex, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about environmental damage while making a monster film. That's what he wanted, anyway. What turns out to be a lot of acting, either little or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to replicate themselves as monster attacks in the river water (Oh, and what luck, encounter a woman that was naked ... although it was There are already cases of disappearance!) <br /> <br /> These are just illogical things, but I assume they are not very harmful; it is not unpleasant at least, and once or twice, we get an almost interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (A father who walks across town with his flock or other pieces like "Hey, this is not America!"). But no matter how hopeful the director was to throw Mitchum or Karadin, he was at best squandered by pedestrians and, at best, a stupid and frightening dialogue. This does not help when we finally get a good look at the monster and the "action" occurs, it is organized foolishly and just a shabby appeal. I usually feel sorry for a movie director who has encountered a lot of problems when finishing a certain picture - in this case, it took the best part of the mid 70s - but with Monstroid or Monster or anything called it ... nah. <br /> <br /> If you get double Elvira DVD for this (bad print with bad quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure you skip this feature. Unless you are, of course, you Elvira is very dead and you can not help yourself to hear her lukewarm comment; I personally prefer to get Joel or Mike Nelson with robots from Mystery Science Theater on this grilled turkey.
