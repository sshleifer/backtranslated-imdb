This film was basically a velvet gold mine if the book got it from five parties and made it a television. Movie. The film lacks Velvet Goldmine, who was good at acting, writing and basically anything else. The film was one of the worst I've ever seen since Wild Wild West. It certainly needs to be interesting. I know that vh 1 has become a familiar name for their music programs. Which is much better than all this that would have worked if it was behind the music loop but it was not and I felt it was flat.
