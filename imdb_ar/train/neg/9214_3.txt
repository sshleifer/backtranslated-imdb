Many things become obvious when watching this movie: 1) Acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Croson are the same, but the conflict between parents and children limits the soap opera. 2) The film as a whole is frustrating and disappointing; 3) Dreams and episodes of annoying Ruby (acting by Tom Hanks); 4) ) 5) Strange lines and side plots are not better than terrible acting; and 5) This film is really bad. Expect to be disappointed - perhaps disturbed.
