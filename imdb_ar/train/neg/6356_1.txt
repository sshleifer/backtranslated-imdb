If I accidentally stumble across this script in a script, I'll read it and maybe laugh. But I will not laugh at the points in the film where the director seems to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not quite sure in terms of these. I do not care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can not write a dialogue, or at least can not write a dialogue deliberately, and then attracts presentations from representatives able to attract laughter from the most famous clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (rephrase) "I am an art historian, I am looking forward to getting a job at an art gallery." <br /> <br /> Well, so he states the truth but honestly, do you know which technical historians might say that? How do you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really? An art gallery? Who would have thought that?" <br /> <br /> The entire script is scattered with a kind of quasi-familiar thought that I did not expect from such a respected writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of work because the other, and based on this, I do not want to start learning. The characters hated without exception, trying to explain that we all suffer from the humanitarian situation? Or really really write a bad character? Will be the referee.
