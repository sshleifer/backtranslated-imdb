I saw this film on the mysterious science scene when it was called "It Lives at Night". This title is far less misleading than the "Batpeople". In fact it will be more accurately called a Batperson. This film revolves around a doctor studying bats that I think of because he wants to heal better than rabies. This is not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife are touring the cave and batting it. Why the world needs a tour to study bats is beyond me. You should not be able to go in the same. Well after being bitten he and his wife spend the honeymoon where he starts to bouts. They go to the worst doctor ever. The man stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the man is killed from 3 to 4 people, and his wife stands next to him, and is supposed to be planted instead of the police chief investigating the murders.
