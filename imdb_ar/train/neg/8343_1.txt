The rescue is the worst horror movie called. There is nothing remotely horrific. Not worth to be in good type. First of all, I do not see how many people can think of this wonderful film. If you write something boring and totally ridiculous because I will laugh and feel very embarrassed to subject others to his stupidity. Second: representation is terrible and the leading actress is very ugly. Third: The story sucks, has been used before, and the excuse that her cheap film is no excuse. Reading summer on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes wasted on something that makes you feel sorry because you saw it. I feel really bad for those crooks and the paradox in their name. All the cold Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
