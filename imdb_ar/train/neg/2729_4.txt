Ruth Roman's real-life gesture began to help entertain soldiers from the Korean War and leave for an air base near San Francisco to greet star Oscar-winning star Warner Bros. to patriotism and song. Many celebrities show the guest as a love story develops from hatred between the emerging star and the violent, green-skinned Air Force (Ron Harthy, who seems to have to hand over papers from his bicycle). It seems that the corporal has deceived the actress in the belief that he is on his way to battle when he is actually part of an aircraft carrier crew, from and to Honolulu (you think she would be happy because he was away from harm, but instead behaves just like most childish females in the 1950s movies) . Doris Day is in the first thirty minutes or so, and the numbers of her distinctive and funny songs are the most fun. Roman is also here, looks charming, while James Kane makes fun of his character on the screen, and Gordon McCraye sings in his handsome barrette. Jane Wyman also sings in a bed next to the hospital after Doris Day's progress, leading to the question "Did their groups run out?" For light viewers, retrieve the flashback to another time and place. However, low-rent production and the appropriate technical aspects only make "Starlift" a second bill. * 1/2 of ****
