Wow you guys are very nice !!! Cornie, Cornie, Cornie So I felt about that film. I started off with a good idea. A man (Edward Asner) escaped from a prison wearing a Santa costume, finds a handful of children believed to be real Santa, so the "fake Santa" enlisted children to help him find a stolen money bag. The movie resembles the Christmas version of "Whistle Down the Wind". The film begins well but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier so much that in the end it becomes ridiculous and you can not take this film seriously. For example, you can get a Scrooge named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), from the entire Douchebag group that treats his little son to a rubbish heap and treats his son so badly that he does not buy decent clothes, worn by poor boy jeans with holes in it ! But a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visits Sumner and by the end of the movie, you'll get every happy man singing Carol Christmas and giving his son a hapless hug ... Yeah, so be Cornie ... I'm all feeling good especially during Christmas, But this film is far superior to me, it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the film surpasses supernatural element film that does not match what is left of it. This is not quite bad, there is some strong representation, especially from the children, but there are a lot of Christmas movies the best.
