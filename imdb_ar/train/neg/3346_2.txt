Cheezy Animation movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time military man retiring from a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and student body left him frustrated and decided he would hang them up. Things get easier when some thieves watch some thieves grab the school as a base for an armored car. In Dolph vs Baddies in Battle to Death. Throwing the jaw back into the exploits of the high-end era where the bad guys were wearing bad guys and some bad women had their hair dyed in the daytime. What a stupid movie. I can not believe that people made this kind of way. It was an action film that might have been condemned before the start of the low budget. The fake separatist groups and the weak movement were a flash in the eyes of the producers. Watch how the movie is delayed as the cars pass through the school (do not ask) and it collides with the security tower (do not ask because it looks like a prison and then the high school) and smash its hard-to-build (not like the previous footage). What are the gods of the bad films that he makes? In fact I'm perplexed because this is directed by Sidney J. Fury, a really good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. Did his abilities fail, or was this hopeless from the start, and he did not even bother? It's Turkey. One sees but Turkey is no less than that.
