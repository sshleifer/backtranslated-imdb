After seeing a remake in 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to see Carla de Ville getting punished for torturing animals for her skin only. The entire film was very funny, and in my view, better than the animated film. But in fact there was no need for a second. First of all, if she returns, she will not heal her and make her mad again. Just let her get out of jail and rap. I thought it was not very funny. There is supposed to be only one puppy back. I was expecting luck to be lucky, because it was the most attractive, besides Roger and Anita too. However, they decided to fully rephrase and add not really one hundred, not even a hundred and two, but only three dogs, and a parrot thinks it is a dog (intelligent). The part of Gerard Depardieu was meaningless. In the end, Cruella suffers a lot, is very humiliating and incredibly exaggerated. Bake inside a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect of the first. This just did not work. It was too much on top, not too funny. I have already felt sorry about Crowela.
