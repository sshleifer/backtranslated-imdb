I mean, seriously, what group would make a crazy car? What if they were ten years old, it was a very immature way for the little boy to sing about "being my ladies" I mean seriously! The name is very beautiful, brothers nudes? Just because they take off their pants ??? HOW CREATIVE.I DO NOT KNOW WHY They NEED PBS I mean most artists do not really need a TV show about themselves, especially the nude brothers band. Heck how many of them in the pooling group. And seriously what with the film? Geez Nick used to be the highlight of the years I grew up but seriously the bare brother band? Many parents will not let their children see this, especially with the name of Naked Brother's, a stupid and non-original program that should not be broadcast on television.
