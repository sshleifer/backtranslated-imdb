John Wayne (John Scott) and Eddie Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change their false identities, turning into "Elias Smith and Jones." Mr. Win becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is supposed to be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". In no time are they entertaining like Roger Davis, Beth Doyle, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; although Win can be considered more successful than any of them, he was wise. Beautiful blonde Marie Corneman (Anne), grown up from her days in "Our Gang", is a beautiful interest to Lewin. She and Chandler have nice scenes with Wayne. If you are not a fan of the low-budget John Wayne movies of the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
