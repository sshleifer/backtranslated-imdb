I agree with most if not all of Tom's former commentator (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a study of great personalities coupled with fighting and excitement in the Great Sword. <br /> <br /> I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I think 14 was not released in Region 1 (USA). Zatoichi outlaws was disappointing. The storyline was complex, and it seems to have been a large collection of many previous Zatoichi story stories. At some point, I was wondering if I did not see a new version of the former Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This film was disappointing because it began to depend on the effects (head wrap, cut off limbs, blood) and less on Zatoichi's nobility. All the previous films have been successful based on the story and the movement, and have won great attention without having to resort to influences. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi movies will not follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film of his own studio. I highly recommend all previous Zatoichi movies - I recommend them.
