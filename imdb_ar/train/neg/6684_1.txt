This must be renamed "Alien State for unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented their snoring as a shock film". It's a long boring story of moral turbulence, a rift so transparent that even the founder of Delta House can see through it. Geoff East, a representative at the point of paying fees, can forgive any action he can get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously worked in motion pictures like George Lucas and Sam Bickenba. Once available on tape but, thankfully, not on DVD. Such trash belongs in landfills and nowhere else.
