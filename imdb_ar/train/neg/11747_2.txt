Although they got some favorable press after playing at Toronto International. Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much of this. One - It's a very low budget Canadian film. Two - it is written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it is Woody Allen or George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But although I saw her with low expectations, she was turning into a much bigger disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In short - bad text, bad behavior, and terrible output! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. She claims to be a comedy, but I just laughed twice. In addition, there is awful music burning all the time. How I got any attention I would never know.
