You will recognize the plot immediately. Girls divorced couple trying to bring back my mother and father again. Yes, this was the subject of the parental trap in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. But here's the scary thing. Although Dina Durbin was younger than the 21-year-old Hiles Mills while playing the roles of steroids, Durbin seems older, as in adults. As do all of her so-called brothers. <br /> <br /> This confusion between adults and the child goes through the film. The girls wear a cute little sailor clothes but look silly in them as the director seems to be making an effort to point out the tops of ample tushies throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking about them as children or women. When Ray Milland et al begins to "beat" them, you will feel as if they are excited about children, and you may be, because they have noticed the amazing things and peaks that the director has pointed out. In teen or small crumbs, little girls or small foxes, you are not quite sure what you are supposed to think about. <br /> <br /> Parents are also very old and the whole movie seems to be very dated. <br /> <br /> This is a rusty version of the parental trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure that tetanus shots are up to date if you do not believe me.
