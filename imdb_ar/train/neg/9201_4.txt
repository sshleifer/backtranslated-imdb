This is the film that captures D & D's fear of the 1980s (and even today). Fear that people playing D & D (or any other role-play game for that matter) will be "absorbed" and lose their ability to distinguish between reality and fiction (and go on killing children, child sacrifices, suicide, etc.). A great movie for anyone who likes to blame society's problems on non-living things, but anyone who plays a role-playing game or a video game or even behaves in a play will consider it an insult to their intelligence. D & D is what Wargames was for computers. In addition to the film, only kinda sucks.
