I could not recommend the Christmas movie more than the worthless driving piece (trust me, double negatives are needed - it's very bad). This film was in a bind from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was himself a screenwriter. All the music numbers are very long and none of them are good ("Thank you so much" for a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I will gladly carry the chains worn by Scrooge in the Strange Hell sequence of the film by sitting through this insult to musical films again. <br /> <br /> The only entertainment part of this film (unintentionally by the way) includes Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Guinness wears a na√Øve white uniform, ironically, watching him either trying to make him look like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain for the need for this terrible film. Meanwhile, Albert Finney blends with Alistar Sim and Charles Logton to create his miserable character from Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is a very ugly person, impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this abomination from filmmaking at any price.
