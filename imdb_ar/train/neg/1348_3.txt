This animated film Inspector Gadget is very beautiful. The story is too weak, there is little work. Most characters do not offer anything to do. The film is moderately pleasurable at best, but it really does not go anywhere and makes no sense. It's viewable but just fair and nowhere near the scale of the 1980s TV show. It is not a movie that is repeated, at least in my mind. It's about 74 minutes away including credits, so I think this is a good thing. Contrary to what appears on the TV show, the characters do not deserve to be rooted here. In the program, you want to apply the Inspector Tool that saves the day, but there, who really cares? Anyway, this is my only opinion. The last case of the tool is 3/10 disappointing
