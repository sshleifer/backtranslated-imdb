I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before he swears his entire work. After dealing with Lucas with Lucas at this early age, Howard has now become stuck in many of the Lucas features. How do you explain its disaster? His only useful film, of course, was "Willow". Everything else, including, depends heavily on the surface scrap. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even focus semi-smart like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard is so caught up in his imitation of Spielbergian that he will be forgotten quickly. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "Love conquers everyone, even disease." It is very bad for Howard that Lynch has already got the entire subtext more skillfully. Heck, so Disney did better than this. Ron even the idiot on the possibilities offered by the imaginative facts. <br /> <br /> Howard's comment trail is just awful. Do not rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Film Dodd
