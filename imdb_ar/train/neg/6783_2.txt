There seems to be a great number of amazing reviews from 8 to 10 stars here from people who did not write an IMDb review before or after. Given the very low rating of other people in the film, I think you might draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I would admit that, I thought the concept was nice, and I was pleased to see the actresses who played the role of Eve and Harmon on Angel in getting a job, but it did not take long to make the film so terrible known. <br /> <br /> Acting: Prospective customers seemed to be efficient, but everyone? Very bad. <br /> <br /> Widget: throttle full of holes large enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: does not exist. <br /> <br /> Humor: Did they do that? I really think that people were laughing? Oh boy. Candy Eye: Well. There were some really beautiful women in this film. Not only the three main female characters, but also in all areas. It was as if the producers were hoping that the scene would keep male viewers distracted so much that they would not notice how horrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hand, this could have been a nice but very funny camp. Not soon.
