A parody of horror is not just something in the 21st century. Before the "Scary Movie" series, there were some examples of this genre, mostly in the 1980s. But as with the franchise mentioned, most of these films will hit or miss. Some like "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" mostly go up on it, but others like "Saturday 14th" is a sequel that fails to offer laughter. But among all these types of films, there is a particularly large culprit, "Transylvania 6-5000", a great waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> FEATURES: Great actors achieve the best results. Some sense of humor is amusing. Horny, but fishing theme song. Some Transylvanian sites are good. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Threadbare plot. The speed is mostly dull. Most humor just does not interrupt. Little monsters are given to do and a little screen time. I think this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? Lame termination would make viewers angry. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This is a comedy? If so then why are the bits really funny a few and far apart? Comedy is supposed to make us roll on the ground, do not turn our eyes and yawn, to hurt her. I can not believe Anchor Bay released this junk. I will admit that it is not the worst films ever produced, but it does not deserve any time or money for anyone even if you love any of the actors. See Transylvania Twist instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
