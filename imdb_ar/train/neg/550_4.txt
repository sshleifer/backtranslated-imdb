After the wonderful AANKHEN (2002), which was a new version of the Gujarati play, comes with the WAQT which also seems to be a play <br /> <br /> In the plays, we have characters who scream, and exaggerate here the same degree <br /> < /> The first half shows Amitabha kidding almost to Akshay Kumar, who is over 40 years old and who acts in a funny way like a small nerd <br /> <br /> The film contains a good letter how to not spoil your son but unfortunately the way Amitabh Wants Akki to make a completely fake official <br /> <br /> So that the cause of his disappearance, and his race of the hospital and the melodramatic speech made by Akki is postponed <br /> < Some emotions do not touch you but most of them go beyond the top <br /> <br /> Rajpal comedy is hilarious but very extended in the second half <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is very exaggerated although some scenes are good Well <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh beats him in the first half but he is terrific in the emotional scenes Akshay Kumar also performs well but seems comfortable in some of the early days of the py scenes of his chemistry with Bachchan undisputed. Rajbal is one of the most prominent things, he makes you laugh without exaggerating his presence, his stupid behavior and humor, a good bohemian riot in some comical parts but loudly in some places. Nothing has to be done, this is her latest film with Akki yet. Shefali is wonderful although it looks very small for Bachchan
