We all know that the film is never fair to the whole book, but this is exceptional. Important figures were cut, Blanka and Alba were basically collected in the same character, and most of the subplans and main elements of the Master Plan were discarded. Clara's clairvoyance has been underestimated, making her seem more superficial than the ones she has known in the book. In the book we learn more about its powers and the important influences it has caused to many people, which in turn has been a key element in the life of the family. In the film she was no more than a private lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-III, by the way, is the son, hence comes after Segundo-second) and its association with the Esteban and his grandson of Pancha Garc√≠a (not the son, which he also does recognize) has been cut into halves and reduced importance. <br /> <br /> One of the most important things for a book that has been stripped of the film: This is called the House of Spirits. where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around "The Big House in the Corner," a line that has been repeated many times in the novel. The house is of primary importance in the story, but the film conveys it unfairly to a background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a shallow, shallow film could be based on this rich and entertaining novel.
