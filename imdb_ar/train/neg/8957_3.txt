unbelievable. Do you get any dumber than this? Not an opportunity. The stupidity of this film would embarrass even Ed Wood and De Palma Wu. If the first part of the string contains an intermediate dialog box and the second part contains a dirty dialog box, this section will contain a cretinous dialog box. amazing. But this time the story was reduced to the level of dialogue as well. Despite acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" would definitely kill the franchise. It is clear that this misguided conspiracy stems from the left wing's frustrated pen. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder whether these leftists are aware of the extent of anti-democracy and dictatorship. In this film, obviously they are targeting the United States? Democracy. Why not target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-army films? Sure, it is unlikely that most of these places will produce a cubicle like this any time soon, but this is next to the subject. Obviously, a book like this rubbish really admires these kinds of systems, whether they know them or not. I would even like to say that anyone who attacks US foreign policy closely all the time has anti-democratic beliefs in essence. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: Apart from being elusive, it is no more funny, the film has many obvious immorality. For example, for some reason the two men who have been in charge of the cube have been doing this for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism of the project, but the first of them suddenly turns on the system! Anyone who has absolutely no idea of ​​human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or what about this ugly character, the evil bureaucracy with eyes that speaks as if it were in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, once this creature appears, the film loses all seriousness and then any chance to be exciting: it really has become a comedy.
