If the original casting idea (the search for Rutger, not Ice-T) was retained, the film would have been successful. Unfortunately, racism had to come to the image (literally) and destroy it. Black-clad production workers could not allow the contestant to be black, so they exchanged the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach to "guidance" only proves that this is an important task for affirmative action. Master of fire, close up, close up. The "smartphones of the line is anyway" used even more creative work in the camera. The rewriting of "The Most Dangerous Game" by Eric, at least an attempt to update the classic story, fails to give us any motivation to see why the characters did so. We never give reasons, other than "one of these people will not miss," why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Regardless of John McNealy's tough performance, Charles Dutton's fair job does not care about that performance. There was a little trivia, and there was a real drunk accident while filming a C injury.
