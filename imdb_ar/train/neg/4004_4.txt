As a big fan or Cracker series, I was waiting 7 years for the following add-on. I am afraid that this episode does not live up to the myth. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after seven years to attend his daughters' wedding and gets involved in the murder investigation. A soldier was tormented by the sudden appearance of his tour of Northern Ireland in a failed killing. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode was the very comfortable way they were all set up and how they led Fitz to the killer. All this is difficult. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good scenes in the appearance of Flash from Northern Ireland that were beautifully filmed.
