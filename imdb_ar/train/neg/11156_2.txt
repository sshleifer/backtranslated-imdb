Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Come on: This is an obnoxious piece of rotten road with a cow. It's just a terrible film. It's an Urban Werewolf movie with some of the worst visuals and a weak story like any nerd from the 80's high school drama film. What's even worse is that poor Ken Hodder was tricked into playing the big bad wolf. Kane and * Coking Hoder. Someone tries to make sure that Jason Voorhees is the culmination of his career ... <br /> <br /> In any case, his former colleague Jaime Bergman also plays in the film and eventually becomes melted. It's a kind of crappy cop drama with the worst melted in the world in it. But has moments of near-naked nudity. But that's it. Want to learn more? Well, foggy fog generally is an ugly black blur of appearance sprang around the screen. When we have the privilege to see an actual conversion sequence, something like a full-motion video is introduced from a video game set up during the early stages of Playstation. First PlayStation. CG animations are really primitive. Good only for fanatics who fear the hardcore who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by pervasive visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
