The performance was not wonderful, the story was full of simple transformations and transparent characters. It is about the repercussions of the conflict between the right-wing Flemish constituency on the one hand and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a kind of Western Belgian side story or Romeo and Juliet modern? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming the director's questions are also). However, some scenes can act as a kind of Ken Loach films, which were filmed in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point for the far-right party Block Block and faced many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very hard to make a film about this attitude, and this film is unsuccessful, unfortunately. However, it tells a story about a very real and complex situation in the present Belgium. The few foreign viewers who watch it should try to enjoy it and realize that it is not the real important film but the social lines behind it that are chasing Belgium, the country with a population of 10 million, in the new millennium.
