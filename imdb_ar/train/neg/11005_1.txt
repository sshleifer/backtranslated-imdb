This film shows a line of graphics, which are partially transmitted to each other. I realized over and over again in the film, at first, only angered me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to circumvent this truth by using absurdity and obscenity. His attempt to stay a comedy failed without any funny. <br /> <br /> My staff is probably a subjective result after watching this movie (oh my God, it hurts me every time I call it "movie"): a bold attempt to turn anything into something great. But it failed. At least make the manager something of nothing. But this is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many of the films did not appear as funny as planned, but this film occupies them all. It is a manifestation of the real life of the worst screenplay scenario. No. To correct myself, it's worse. The movie with the gags is too bad, and it's not funny at all. It is not fun to watch the actor, writer and director (all three by the way) drown in a sea of ​​bad movies. The film is very bad for that.
