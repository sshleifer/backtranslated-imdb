The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are quite acceptable and amazing. The characters are believable and interesting. The cloning lab seems really high tech. After that, everything collapses. The characters begin to act foolishly, and a new subplot is presented from anywhere around the fusion reactor (this is supposed to be "present") becomes critical, and the only justification is that it is required to kill the dragon - just do not. The end is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a film that has started well so far. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> All the characters except Dean Ken are played by the Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vesela Dimitrova, called "Billy Kent" despite her heavy accent (although on one occasion she turns to Spanish *!). <br /> <br /> Because of the decent start, I thought of rating this movie as 5, but it was more frustrating than that, so I give it only 4.
