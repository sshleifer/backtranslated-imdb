I love movies about morally corrupt characters, but that was a lot. The acting was not great, but that was not the real problem. The problem was feeling drenched in my stomach hole in about 20 minutes in the film. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and little they had devoted to the cruelty they showed to each other under the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker aspects of a group of characters may be wonderful, but you have to give these characters real characters or they just cut cardboard. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
