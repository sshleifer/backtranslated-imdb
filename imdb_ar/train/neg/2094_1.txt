I had to endure the anger of teenagers, high schools and family conflict throughout the show. I really do not care about high school girls who are worried about their relationships. I've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues, and I do not care about the fantasy teenagers who go through the "light" models of horror you've endured. I want a science fiction that's the only reason I'm here. There was a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. Finally we see Proto Celon. It was good but with one problem. The red eye would point a lock on the object of interest. We all know that the Cylon eyes always scan back and forth, providing the device with a map of the world. The red dot never stops moving back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the book will correct this abuse before the second episode.
