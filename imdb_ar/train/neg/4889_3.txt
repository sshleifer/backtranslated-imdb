The most entertaining line in England, where, far from the Native America of Vixen! , The word "fanny" has a completely new meaning. Unfortunately, it's the only laugh you'll get in this horrible sex comedy that's neither sexy nor funny. <br /> <br /> Not impressive with the painted brows, Erica Gavin (the ability to act: 0) is the bravest of lusts after her brother, but he refuses his black friend while making derogatory remarks about the melon. As if in revenge, ask her whether she would go with the Shetland Mehr. Also referred to as "make it with monkeys". Gavin's ability to shake and shiver with sexual pleasure at the slightest touch is incomparable only in the lack of splendor of temptation? Which involves fire and hemoglobin.
