The premise is amazing and some of the acting, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rap, are charming ... but this film is unreachable. The music looks as if it comes from some kind of royalty free website and songs as if it were written with an open rhyme dictionary on the lap. Most singing is outside the key. I think they may have filmed "Akabila Singing" and put it in the music underneath it ... The dialogue is really stupid and vulgar. The film works better when it talks about the property, but unfortunately, it turns into stupid sub-plots. I found myself checking my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 minutes I wondered, "When will it end?"
