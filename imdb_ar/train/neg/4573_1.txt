I did not know much about this film before I saw it, but I heard it was quantum physics, so I was interested. What I did not know is that this is not a true story, but a group of newcomers who like their voice talk about how little they know about quantum mechanics. I say it belongs to the category of documentaries rather than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marley Matlin in the film, to give this New Age seminar a story of some kind. Parts of the film feel terrifying and aim to present the speaker's ideas so as not to die of boredom. Mattlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the new hippie who hangs on the couch. We get to listen to anonymous people arguing about what quantum physics means to them. The only bright spot in this film was the female speaker from India (I suppose), but I think he attended the wrong film. <br /> <br /> Barbara Eden seems to have really allowed herself to go on and on about how quantum science correlates with crazy new-age beliefs. It seems that the Quark of the DS9 was low in cash as it appeared in the film for a short time. There are a lot of whizbang CGI that we are supposed to be impressed with; cells appear in the body as the templates of the dance dancer, because the filmmakers have seen Flubber one many times. <br /> <br /> People in the film say that Arawak in San Salvador thought the Columbus ship was invisible because citizens had never seen clipper boats before, as if people today had any possible way of knowing it. Of course they leave all this information and say only "Columbus ships were invisible to Indians in America." The movie takes many of these arrogant hops. Thomas Young experimented with two parts around 1805 and found that light can appear as a particle at some time, and a wave at some time. Of course you will not know this * ever from watching this stupid movie because the only sign to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves." This should mean that people can walk through walls, walk on water and not progress in age if they want to get a star !! Then I'm sure Marley Matlin may stop being deaf if she believes * with enough force. I am cynical, but this film is filled with false hope and beliefs that the people who embrace them do not really hold on to it. <br /> <br /> These are new people of the New Age who have taken quantum theory as if reaffirming everything they think about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, and so on. If these hawkers in snake oil really believe in the foolishness they were selling, they could not just want to get their checks instead of appearing in this joke? We talk to another unidentified man, without credentials we know, talking on his couch in front of a stove (or television screen) about how to create his own life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to rush and throw a pie at him. These people take themselves seriously. Another bald guy in a suit says that no one ever touches anything because there is a magnetic force that prevents it at the quantum level. If someone has entered the screen and kept punching him in the stomach, yelling "I'm not touching you! The moral relativism in the film claims that there is "nothing good or bad". Is it clear that Hitler killed millions of Jews to death? Another person says that there is no such thing as love. It's just a chemical and we do not really love people. We're addicted to the chemical rush we feel when we're around. I think this man is doing this movie as a community service because he is addicted to heroin for many years. <br /> <br /> We are seeing a really pathetic sequence where two young men are walking around a wedding party, seeing everything like Robocb. They assess whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and the sexual position emerges on the pebble. Marley Matlin is immersed in the wedding he is supposed to imagine, and the next day she decides to love herself and bathe as she is a beautiful and unique snowman. <br /> <br /> I liked when the film said that people often find evidence of their preconceived notions. Maybe in this review, I only see what I want to see, but I really wanted to see these people dominating the face, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of any of the ideas presented in the movie before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie talking about the uncertainty principle in Heisenberg, go to "The Man Who Was not There". If you want to read a good book about quantum field theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to watch a movie talking about different philosophies with innovative images, check out Waking Life (although it can be bored, self-importance, and sometimes pretend). All in all, you should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time in this movie. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very hard time giving movies a score of 1 to 10, but that was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is correct. People in this movie do not know # $ *! Down, the worst film I've ever seen.
