So rewriting great history continues Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This was ridiculous nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the huge amount of money that can be spent on producing the most expensive and most actionable movie I have ever seen. It is appalling. <br /> <br /> Nick Cage's short courtship with serious acting seems over. I can only assume that leaving Las Vegas was a flaw in a series of scary films. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proved that her performance at Troy was not just a coincidence, she really could not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself to work on such a journey. <br /> <br /> It is only recommended to those who recover from recent surgery or to people who have seen America invent the world.
