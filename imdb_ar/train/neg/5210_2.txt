First let me be honest. I have not seen all this film. I saw the first five minutes, and when I realized that I had almost landed for sleep, I decided I might quickly come up to see if it was more interesting later ... it did not happen. This film is just a bunch of lame attempts to portray an interesting story that has already been told to something that can not become: a decent horror film. Because I feel it's important to say that even a film with bad special effects can be good if it is well prepared. This movie is not and will put you in a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I feel it's important to say that I think this film is in the public domain, so if you feel you should see it completely, it is clear that the littelsearch website will show you a place you do not need to pay to watch this pile of movie dung.
