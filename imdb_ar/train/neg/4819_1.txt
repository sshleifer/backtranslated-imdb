This typical mess in the 1970's budget is low. Is supposed to be a documentary about a Big Foot crew in the Northwest Pacific. Every character is a stereotype, from Native Americans to cynical cowboys. Representation and narrative a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of Foot Foot shots, keep on hoping. There will be a lot, and what you can do in your backyard with cheap costume and camcorder; it would be better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Not that I do not like the low fare of 1970; I do. It is this mess of bad behavior, bad characters, bad story, and not excitement that you can not enjoy. Do not fit into the category of "very bad it is good", and you can not laugh at the extent of its harm without the help of illegal substances. It's mostly a lot of boring footage of people camping, hiking, riding, watching wildlife. There is a Bigfoot attack which is completely stupid. Our friend Sascoch is supposed to throw stones at the camp from the top while firing their guns at him. At this point, you root deeply to throw some rock on the head of the director and stop everything.
