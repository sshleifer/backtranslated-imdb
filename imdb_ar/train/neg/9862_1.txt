I could not believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I would laugh well, because I played the role of D & D throughout half of my life. I had to turn it off so I had a company and they were wondering what nonsense I was watching. <br /> <br /> I finished it later and had to leave it in the dreaded clown gay porn at first. No, they run a series of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, wearing clothes as KKK ... This film is totally out of the ordinary for anyone playing D & D. <br /> <br /> No wonder it seems that the real D & D will not allow them to use their game. Who wants to attach his name to this?
