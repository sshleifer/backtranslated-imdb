Yes there are great offers here. Unfortunately, speaking in the context of a film does not seem to have an idea of ​​what it does. During the first 45-60 minutes of all this, all music is performed as a realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters that, up to this point, have always been talking to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, just a little further, from anywhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of continuous dialogue, then they seem to have dropped this idea and moved on to other things, such as the number starts at the jazz club with the drummer and two electric guitars turn Suddenly into a piece that is completely orchestrated with a huge invisible thread. In addition to all this contradiction in how music is used, the apparent inability of composers to write music is actually the way it is supposed to be filmed. While the first two pieces mimic Motown's voice in the 1950s, the rest of the film is just Broadway. Then there is the sheer generosity of the clippings of a group that imitates the poor Jackson family and Eddie Murphy from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started steer Stevie Wonder, I could not help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that made me appreciate the lack of time on earth and the resentment that I wasted two hours watching this movie.
