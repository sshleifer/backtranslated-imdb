This reminded me of a lot of SOO about Michael Weiner's "bad weekend" because of his bad sense of the low English budget. <br /> <br /> First, I must say that I admire both exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, for example, "guilty" because of its irrelevance and "the last house on the left" because it is absolutely brutal. And any number of innovative and increasingly brutal Italian vocabulary. <br /> <br /> It was meaningless. "Let's re-create" I spit on your grave "without making it very scary after the horror returned to fashion with Hostel. <br /> <br /> The whole thing does not stop together or you have a point. Why the trouble of having a man be an expert in security cameras?
