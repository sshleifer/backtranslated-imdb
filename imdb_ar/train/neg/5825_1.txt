This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There were people leaving the theater, others were sleeping (well, I had a late-night show) ... this is a meaningless movie, one of those who can not make you never want to see a picture outside mainstream again. I would like to see the making of this film as I am very interested in what is going on in the minds of the authors of this garbage. Do they laugh when they create all these silly things or do they really think they're doing something interesting? I wonder ... the soundtrack is awful apart from some musical instruments that remind you of the previous album Bjork. Even if you love Bjork music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. There are not a few small musical pieces that make you go out and be subjected to this torture. Allah!...
