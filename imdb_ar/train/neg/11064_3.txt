Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here but I feel I should say something. I was not exactly looking for a "scatter festival" as someone said or even "Blood and Courage / Gore". I have some respect for relatives of the victims even though I really felt that the director DID NOT. - They were anonymous and anonymous. Just a strange pot of Dahmers nationality. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with a kind of obsessed curiosity that makes me think "What makes a man a serial killer?" I also wonder about the details of the Dahmer story, about which I know little. It seems that people here believe that the film did not have to cover the story of Dahmer's story .. His history, what happened when he was arrested, followed, etc. But it is important! As you can see, I suppose if you are an American you will know all this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man as it is obvious, requires that some events be displayed / displayed at least from the date and actual events. This does not mean blood and courage, there are ways to show the horrible things in the movie by embedding or intelligent photography without resorting to gore. Without touching on what he did (I found out more about reading user comments on this site!), The film felt like a vacuum. Moment in time with very little article. I would like to know if there is a film about REAL Dahmer because because of the lack of direction, very slow and never changes, a strange depiction of homosexuality and a very unfortunate lack of any attempt at the end, this film is very bad. I would not recommend anyone wasting the time it takes to watch it. Clear 1 out of 10 (for representation!)
