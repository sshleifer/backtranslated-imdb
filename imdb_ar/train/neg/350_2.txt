Fishburne (who seems strangely funny) and Ed Harris (a short show) are fantastic, unlike Connery, who does not seem to make sense in his role and ends up in the motor behavior of an 80-year-old man. In fact, the script does not make sense; imagine 60 minutes. The happy ending plot in addition to the sudden appendix without any controversial structure regarding the characters. It is more an accident than a scenario and may be useful for examination purposes in screen schools. The more I mentioned the details, the stronger the impression. The death penalty is not an issue here, although it is a topic from the beginning; it kind of fades away without further comment. Theme and environment may be good.
