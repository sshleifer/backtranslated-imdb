In his first scenario, based on his short story "Turned", William Faulkner presents a curious story of allegiance, sacrifice and truly alien relations. The story was originally about Tone, Young and Cooper characters only, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another to fulfill her contract, and Volckner was obliged to create a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same cut style as Young and Tone of the participating stars, resulting in an unintended joy because these three communicate in a telegraph-like abbreviation like Monty Python ("Wuthering Heights"). Seriously, the semi-implied sentences almost make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some of the familiar Fauchner themes, with a close-normal relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in the presence of a tone, instead of the engagement ring, all three episodes of their childhood are exchanged with each other. It is also worth mentioning near Tone and Young, especially as they go to the fate of Thelma & Louise. Frankly, it's creepy. <br /> <br /> But this is not a creep for this New Yorker, as the recurring theme of the huge palace, Wellington, which Crawford has mercilessly recognized (which shows gamble on her hands - I was getting away!) and turns Young into a wrestler. Blech. <br /> <br /> However, there are some great offers. Young is particularly engaged in a scene where he was on a Cooper fighter jet, and Russo Carnes delighted as Cooper's friend to fly. Tone, though unable to express himself through realistic dialogue, enjoys a pleasant moment, dashing his mysterious tears about the fate of his companion Young. Crawford, who was stripped of a meaningful dialogue, often appears to be either wooden or melodramatic, a work perfectly balanced for one role. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes - not surprisingly, for Howard Hawks - are the most exciting part of the entire picture. But not enough. To me, this is 75 minutes of my life I will never go back to.
