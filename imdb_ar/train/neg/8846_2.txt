In the Tower of Babel part of the miniature series, the storyteller describes the builders of the tower as "descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> This is like the saying of George Washington, who lived several centuries before Alexander the Great. The light bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was a leading bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> I need to say more? <br /> <br /> The book "The Greatest Bible Heroes" should have paid at least more attention to the chronology of Bible events and events.
