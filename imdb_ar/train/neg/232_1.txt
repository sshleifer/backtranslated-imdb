This was to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate shows up he is good with a group of players and they begin to clap ... even Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands on the sidewalk, apparently she was studying the pavement's strength. Andy is very bad in this film - I could not communicate with them or feel like I love each other. However, the other women were good and cast a shadow over Andy. Anyway, this movie was a movie. I usually liked this kind of movies but I could not get into this movie. Many situations are unlikely and again Andy's representation did not help the film. Also, are all gums. Lancome should put her makeup with a paste knife because she looks glamorous in the business.
