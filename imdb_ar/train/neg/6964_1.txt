I usually check out the MTV Movie Awards for a clever and Muslim show that offers a unique prize (Chewbacca wins Lifetime Achievement Award as an example). So this year was no different. While I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan, Sean William Scott was a fool to me. I laughed at Stiefler in American Pie movies, and enjoyed it even at Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV movie awards were simply appalling. There was nothing interconnected, fun, or fun. Justin Timberlake must commit to singing and dancing; he is certain that hell can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to know who the authors are. Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gillard last year were very funny (the Lord of the Rings simulation was worth seeing the entire show), but this year was quite different. Did he understand one of Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They stare at the movie together, but they never met!") Where was the joke? Kate and Locke have just entered into a lame dialogue, never referring to Timberlake's "joke." Shawn was totally wasted as a gift, so he did not make me smile, but I laugh alone. What is the purpose of the Harrison Ford outline? Have they made any sense to anyone? MTV authors may have guessed that young viewers would only know the aging of Ford as Han Solo or Indiania Jones or the president of Air Air One. I'm puzzling. Will someone tell me in agreement with Adrian Prodi? How old is this man and how old he thought? The 30-year-old man seems to be trying to act at the age of 19 again .... He gives up, presents some grade (as in the best actor award speech to your active academy) and behaves in your age! <br /> <br /> I give this star show out of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for the best visual performance. It was very creative, very well executed, and caused only real laughter throughout the evening.
