Yes. I certainly saw this movie years ago when it was about the movie Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled story took a look at the Hollywood style, borrowed scripts from better industry movies in music. There is nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, sparkling costumes and choreography = more money for the questionable "Beyonce". <br /> <br /> If you are like a recoil, you must appreciate the actual groups that struggled (without having digital and imperial sounds in Hollywood). <br /> <br /> Beyonc√©'s involvement in the making of this rubbish rubbish.
