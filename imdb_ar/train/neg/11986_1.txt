What a terrible writing and acting. Not personal. What, can not you make a good movie with a single character? Well, this was done in Castaway with self-dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this child goes on a journey to see his father. The child, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot faces a heart attack and dies in the middle of the flight. So the child crashes into the lake and survives. Then he runs, and stays in the wilderness until he is saved. <br /> <br /> During that time, the bear fights twice. The first time he fights out in the lake. The second time he makes a spear from the branch and throws the bear. Two shots of fake blood emitted from the breast of the bear reminded me of the "Holy Grail" of Monte Python. <br /> <br /> Also, the child decided to kick the porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> A gag.
