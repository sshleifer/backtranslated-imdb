The idea is that something interesting happens in the first 10 minutes to keep the audience hanging. Late Night Shopping avoids attention for longer. When we get to a point, it's strange that I think I should misunderstand them. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of one of Osaka's owners who rented the same apartment for two people at the same time working in different shifts and thus did not realize they were sharing. "But what about the weekend?" Asks his friend. Sean does not have enough explanation. Sean then tells the story of his similar problem, that he is not sure that his girlfriend still lives at home because he works at night and they work during the day so they do not see each other. This was happening for three weeks. But his friend does not ask, "Yes, but as I said before, what about the weekend?" "You have to see it later, it does not make sense, what is it about, Sean, are you on medicine or something?" We assume they work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking to see if soap and towels have been used. (In fact, strangely, he begins to carry soap with him). But what about conditioner, girlfriend, shampoo, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is there any missing? Have you purchased any? In the bedroom, was the common bed made or not? Are their clothes used and shared with clean clothes? Is the laundry basket complete? In the toilet, does the seat up or down? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> To determine all this, Paul arranged to leave early to see if his girlfriend was still living at home. Why not only contact them? <br /> <br /> But it's getting worse. In the last chapter, although no one told Vincent where to go to the rest of the group to find them. Lenny's interest in love and his girlfriend, Sean, seem to be their best friends and they manage to find the group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these unexpectedly unexpected coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is fine but not nearly good enough to make up for weak characters or an unpleasant lame story. <br /> <br /> I heard one of the representatives interviewed and promised that "no arms, no drugs and no corsets." I thought, "Great." But after half an hour of boredom I screamed on the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It would not take much to solve these problems but on the official website, the director boasts that the film has not been edited. That's all you need to know.
