This was one of the most absurd and poorly directed films I've seen in a long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I would try this: a serious mistake. The film is supposed to show how the real son of Sam's murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what she did really was about the most boring characters I suspect anyone cared about with their drug problems, marriage problems, And so forth. Then shoot back to Saturday Night Fever! The most ironic thing is to choose Spike Lee to appear as a reporter in the film: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, keep away from the movies, making them worse off. The most ridiculous scene was that the dog spoke with a clumsy voice, which was filmed in a scene before it was supposed to have been shot? Spike, what did you think when I made this film? Not thinking at all is my guess. People who think they will see a criminal drama, take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser. You better watch Jerry Springer in this case! The film was wasted, I gave it 1 out of 10: a horrible bird.
