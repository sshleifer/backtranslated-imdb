Full command. The unfortunate appearance of toxic culture hypocrisy of a decade. In this film, pedestrians are walking on slavery along with colonial subtexts (red-haired spam feeds Shaka rice?). Forget historical reality too. Did not most western slaves come from West Africa? American fragrant easily controlled the Chaka with a bunch of men? Finally, David Hasselhoff was no more odious. One can only think, how was it received in the series? (Probably helpless). The thumbnails were wonderful, and it was unfortunate that DH had to put his hands on something unique and make it ordinary. (I tend to believe that he was a hand in creating this failure).
