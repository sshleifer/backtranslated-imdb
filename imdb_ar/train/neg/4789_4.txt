"Phantasm" (1979) was a powerful horror of horror in the air, frightening, and very frightening, in a single word, a cult. The first sequel of 1988 was Gory, witty, action packed and very entertaining. After the first sequel, it appears that the creator of "Fantas" Don Coscarelli lacked new ideas. The "Third Illusion - the Lord of the Dead" 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is quite entertaining, but there is no other originality, and the desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tiring, making it disappointing compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> Initially, the mystery behind the mysterious hidden balls (silver balls that suck the brain) was introduced. From now on, there are a number of new and unnecessary naughty characters (like Tim, a "single at home" - a small-style kid happens to be wonderful in shooting, rocky, tough black chick swings with Nunchaku). The movie also enjoys its features - Reggie Bannister is very wonderful again like a guitar tango Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still crawling just like Tall Man, but the fact that Tall Man talks more in this film makes him lose some of his creep. Mike played the role of a. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James Legros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make much difference. The film also remains interesting enough to watch, but it is still disappointing, especially as attempts to compensate for the lack of ideas are very fast. <br /> <br /> Phantasm III has been thought of as a "time-acceptable" time, but it is certainly disappointing compared to its predecessors. "Phantasm" fans can try it out, but I recommend not setting your expectations too high.
