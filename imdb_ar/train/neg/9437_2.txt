I did not consider myself a lot of "students" when it comes to watching movies, watching them, expressing opinions, and that's it. But not all of this is unhinged. This film is by far the most efficient filmmaking experience I have ever seen. Every child shakes the university and thinks he will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino. This film must be delivered with a booklet entitled "How do you make a film?" Not only is there no story in which filmmakers must not be qualified enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a while since I've seen it, but all I can say is watch the overhead tracking footage in the opening scenes. Never ending! It looks like your teeth have pulled out, not just fun.
