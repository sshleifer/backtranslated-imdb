I remember that Devil Dog was playing on TBS about 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watched and laughed the whole day. This is not a bad thing for a horror film made specifically for television, but it is derived (mostly from the evil spirit repellent) and my work, because there is no better word. You will not miss great cinematography or acting, but it is not a waste of time either. It's the type of film you watch that kills a few hours when you're not in the mood to think about it is very difficult. <br /> <br /> However, if you go to the movie in search of some laughter, you will not be disappointed.The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with the eyes of the cursed children, are not very calm, the screen effects The blue blue of the giant black dog (with horns!) Is a side split. Watch the shadowy shady shadows in Maverick in the shadows towards the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is not a terrifying horror film in any form of fantasy, but I hope they still do things Like this for TV.
