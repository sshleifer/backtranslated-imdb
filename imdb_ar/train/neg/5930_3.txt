Hello, <br /> <br /> If you want to make a documentary film about Leonard Cohen, try setting it up on Leonard Cohen! This is full of Leonard just to irritate the viewer who will leave and wonder why they listen to all these other (some dubious) singers talking about themselves. Puleeze .... It seems like they are rewriting their memoirs in the beginner - Who cares about you, and what about Leonard? Guess what people deserve, if you "do something" they deserve, someone might make a documentary about you. I found a special insult to review U2 members as if that would add credibility to this movie - no. Leonard does not need a bono or edge speaking of his spirituality. It would not have been nice if directors had embodied some of his spirituality through film. Jie, what a concept! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their songs of Cohen's songs - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you!
