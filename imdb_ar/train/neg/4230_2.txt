Well, I love B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to represent. But that's just awful. I'm surprised that he got such a decent overall result. The only qualities recovered from this click are marginal influences (often). Do not get me wrong, I have a lot of influences in this click - but a few of the effects really jumped in my face (like the "anal probe" ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I think this movie was filmed on camcorder. C'mon - Rent Betacam At least, I've seen pornographic with better production values ​​(and better representation too). <br /> <br /> Acting - sucked! But not in Troma or Full Moon mode. <br /> <br /> The story - contrived! But that's what you get from movies like this. Too loose! <br /> <br /> Sets and props - sucked! My 16-year-old brother is doing more elaborate sets for our Halloween home. <br /> <br /> Sucks dubbing and dialogue - suck it! (I should not call it acting) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good classic horror and the classification of B / spots clicks there is not difficult to track. Do you have a reputation by not wasting time in this crap!
