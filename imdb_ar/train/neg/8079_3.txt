After another film with an interesting premise and some peculiar special effects that fall directly into the trash. <br /> <br /> The boring trend and performances (with the exception of the beautiful Annabel Schofield which is pretty much like a brunette and probably deserves the best material, and Charleston Hardon ever hard) earn a real stinky rating. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that watching the Histon leads up to the usual par and showing how bad this movie really is. So he plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested only to see how he was associated with returning to the main line of the film. The way they ended up solving the problem was that they did not. It simply falls out of the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time in this one.
