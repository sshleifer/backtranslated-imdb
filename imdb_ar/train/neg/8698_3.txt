Well, I remember I saw the first, and did it. After watching him, I laughed at him and said to myself, "Hey, boy, just another low budget movie, I will never see a part of this film." Then, after about a year and a half, came the second part. Sucked more. But I laughed again and said, "There's no way I'm going to see part of this part." After that, about half a year later, part 3 appeared. I was stupid enough to hire him and a boy, I just picked up after watching him. By God, I did not really realize how much movies you could suck these days. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole chain. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
