I did not think this was absolutely terrible as some people seem. It seems like one of the cheese horror movies that you might lose in the middle of the night when you can not sleep, although it is admittedly not as good as it is. It's true that acting is not great - I thought that Marianne McEndroe as Cathy Beck, for example, was quite emotional - but the main problem was that many aspects of the plot did not make sense to me. The Becks in a trip described by John (Stuart Moss) as part of the work and partly the honeymoon they have never had (now become a romantic!) Part of the work has to do with tours of the caves that seem strange in themselves (how to be part of a tour group via a cave ) But it becomes strange when we discover that a doctor is doing research in preventive medicine (huh? I've lost this relationship completely.) The cave begins to shift to what I think was supposed to be a human hybrid (though when we see it) End in makeup, it looks a lot like a monkey of some kind) and start a wave of murder. Here is another problem. The first murder is a nurse in the hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is for a young girl who is said to have been hit in the throat. Sheriff (Michael Pataki) tells us that her death was similar to a nurse (meaning that the larynx exploded - how can anyone believe it was an accident?) And what about the Brigadier? It seems to make no sense until the scene in the hotel room of Kathy when he takes a large dose of alcohol and then rapes it, and then everything seems to go back to normal. She is burdened with an end that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most outrageous song songs she has ever heard of in a movie. Still, there was something that made me watch. Sometimes, pure cheese can give you an hour and a half. Too bad, yes - but not as awful as some people say.
