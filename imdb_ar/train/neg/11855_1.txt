This is one of those movies that appear on the cable in like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives during the irons. Representation is the second rate. Poor Matthew Modin seems to be walking through the entire film. God helped Jenna Gershon. Her accent is more than the top. This does not sound like a real English woman. It seems forced and false, like acting. You must adhere to what you do best, studio girls lesbians con- an artist who plays rock band and has a drug problem. Other characters are not the best. Two dimensions. Empty, bland and silly. How should we care about these people? At one point Christie Scott Cashman is lost in Central Park. really? It is not difficult to navigate in Central Park. Just follow any way out. Not only did I care about any of the characters, I hated them frankly. The only reason I stayed with the wreck of the movie was Fisher Stevens. Even his wonderful humor could not save this dying fish. Each fare scene is a typical romantic comedy and there is nothing left to surprise us. The script was awful as it was acting. If you catch this fish, throw it!
