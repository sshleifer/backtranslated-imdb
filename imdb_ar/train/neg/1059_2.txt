I watched this movie last night, and I struggled to remember a lot about it. The story revolves around a group of criminals fleeing a space criminal colony. Fly to the moon in the trash bin in the space age. When they are there, they frighten the garbage men who work at the Moonbase base. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that low-budget science fiction films often include desert planets or, like this film, criminals fleeing the penal colonies. Why this I have no idea. But I can say with some certainty that these films are always satanic. This is really no exception. It starts well with a decent credit sequence and a midway soundtrack. Then turn into a boring science fiction film. Very few results occur in this film, as I struggle literally to write a useful review, so if you read this, I apologize for not being able to enlighten you about the minute details of the film. For the record, I remember a boring bunch of bad guys, a boring bunch of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a three-dimensional picture of a naked woman. Otherwise, I fight. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you may be interested in garbage man activities, I will not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend it to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
