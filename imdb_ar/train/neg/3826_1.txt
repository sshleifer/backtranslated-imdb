Damn, I think I saw some bad Westerners. This can not be topped one though. I think it would be better to have my eyes open to the trinity trinity feature to perform loud. I do not think I will be able to see Ben Hur again without laughing at my ass. Only very bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like the stupid West with the recognized stars in the game, take a quick look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just bad, but funnier. 10/01
