This movie is mostly chasing scenes and special effects. It's very weak in the plot. Most modern computer was just mumbo-jumbo. I saw this because I was a big fan of the original War Games, which mostly depended on the reality of computer and real computer terminology. This film was none of that. Most of the computer sights were impossible and very unrealistic for computers and real networks, but only lame. It looks like it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game was lame and it was basically just an arcade game. No real piracy, what is the point? The film was boring. The lame sequel.
