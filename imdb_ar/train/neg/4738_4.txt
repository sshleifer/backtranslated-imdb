I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, an attractive story, fantastic soundtrack, and the output (Kitamura! Rocks), editing, not to mention the beautiful Oita verse that filled the part perfectly. I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after seeing it at last I felt like I had won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up the place where Azumi stopped, but there are two completely different colors, much slower, the procedure is not as exciting, Personally, this seems to have been directed by the same person responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster privilege (if possible!) I agree with some previous reviewers who say this was a lost opportunity. If Riuhei Kitamura only continues to This installment, however, there are some beautiful Japanese forest landscape that must be Look at them as the slow action unfolds, and we have very briefly introduced small figures who are being killed quickly, even the real bad guys are being killed very easily without much fighting. Fighting with Spider-Man (directly from a ring of monkey!) In the bamboo forest It was revolving around a memorable battle scene and since it was at Azumi 1 we had a fighting scene with camera barrel effects, Azumi brought us 2 Az Azumi head cam !! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still did a good job. Looks great in the head ... but where did you get it? I do not think I will watch this again and again! ... is not easy.
