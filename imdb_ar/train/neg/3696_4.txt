I usually give this film 6. It deals with a very important subject and does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which is an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea whether she received physical instructions to play such a character or is naturally annoying, but she did a wonderful job of making it impossible for me to take care of Lexi. There is still no other than being confused, helpless and useless, and the extent of her desire to grumble. I can understand how a little girl who blames herself for losing her girlfriend and out of eating disorders out of control will be terrifying, frightening and painful. However, Wright's entire performance depends on continuous crying and throat, while the rest is whining. I could only feel that the problem of this particular girl was not because of the bulimic demon, but because of the lack of her spine. I doubt very much that this is the point the film aims to achieve.
