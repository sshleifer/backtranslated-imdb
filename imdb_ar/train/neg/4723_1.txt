First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone from the former Yugoslavia who are not radical Serbian extremists will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and Serbian side only. Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film is made by the Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the "professionals" interviewed are not professional at all. Someone reads only a book written by some extreme Serbs, the other is a denier of genocide and so on. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenes were charged in this film. The entire war continued in Slovenia for several days, and only because the Slovenes were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA was unable to reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the outbreak of war between Croatia and Serbia). Every Slovenian is angry at all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croat will agree on one thing: independence was too early. Perhaps all major conflicts can be avoided. However, the mention of World War II and some unrelated things was a pathetic attempt to really justify everything. Just imagine that the Japanese are dropping bombs on Seattle and Washington, and saying that is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will find no evidence of a YNA soldier strangling and killing Serb civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with a reporter commits his allegations about Serb civilians near Vukovar. All over the Internet. The director forgot to mention the Vukovar bombing completely by YNA (now on the Serbian side and Montenegro and full of Serbia and Montenegro) and let us not start the Chetnik movement. At first, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the Nazis, including Ostashi, ethnic cleansing and the resistance of the Yugoslav rebels once again. There are thousands of other things, but you can check it out easily. There are many misleading things in this film. Only a few of the charges are true. All Croats are angry at this film. <br /> <br /> I think I do not need to mention the denial of genocide in Srebrenica, a genocide that contains a lot of evidence. Imagine the film about Holocaust denial. This film is the same. According to this film, Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo blew themselves up. The anger of every Bosnian Muslim of this film. <br /> <br /> In a way, the director forgot about the short occupation of a small piece of Macedonian land by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians never entered the Serbian border. If Serbia is not already starting to believe some of this film, know that the Serbs have some kind of propaganda that Bosnian Croats and Muslims and Macedonians are indeed Serbs who made their history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say this film is "small" and pro-Serb. <br /> <br /> Serbian radicals are very happy with this film (about 40% of Serbs vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this documentary is so little truth, my advice to all is: Inform yourself before watching this movie. After that, you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See real, neutral documentary films about the death of Yugoslavia.
