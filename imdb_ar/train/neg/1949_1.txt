The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo since the series premiered in 1969. I did not think much about animated Scooby Doo movies (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full-length movies), but some of them were fantastic, and most people like to find Scrappy Doo is irritating, but this series is pure rubbish. As soon as I saw the animation, I heard the characters, (and I use the term loosely) talking, stumbled. In addition, Mystery Inc. , A team, and without the integration of the entire crew, it just seems to open a box of chocolates to find someone who has already eaten the best, and the only thing left is people who do not want them. What's new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you want a TV series from Scooby Doo, include the elements that made this series long lasting. Cast full of characters, quality animation. They need to put this under the rock where it came from.
