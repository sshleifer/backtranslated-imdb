Killer Zodiac. 1 out of 10. Worst representation ever. Not really the worst behavior at all. David Hess (the last house on the left, not one of the seventies, he hired it really well) is the worst in the group (rather stiff but surprisingly impressive). To find a participant in a home movie with such an awkward camera. The movie actually spreads to a stunningly painful stop when it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie does not actually have any replacement properties for Mr. Hess. He was filmed with a home movie camera and looking at things very old with Mike Boom. Not after production either. Come, there must be some shovel pots that a five year old computer can use to clean this image. Throwing strange shots of the autopsy and aircraft carrier takeoffs, this is a visually distorted image. Images of autopsies are distorted in the way that Italian cannibals are intertwined with animal killings. The footage is supposed to be an anti-war statement (because we know that all the bloodthirsty madmen join the navy) What is the Lion's Gate in the world doing to release this garbage? It would embarrass Truma. The plot revolves around Zodiac Killer (last seen in Dirty Harry ?? ... not one of the seventies ... hired it really well) someone gets shot in the stomach in Los Angeles, and the police assume that Zodiac Killer is back? Hey. What can you expect from a film that does not know that DSM IV is a book that does not represent psychological turmoil, where the relationship of the older young killer resembles the relationship between the Congressional page and the close congressman? Yes Eighties hairstyles and production values ​​meet subplot Nambla. Join me.
