The United States seems to be running the UK police, all of whom are armed with teeth. Did you know that the Criminal Investigation Department officers turn into formal clothes when they stop working and go down in the bar? This must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst picture of the "real" UK police that has been imposed on the restful audience. I can see that Mr. Snipes probably needed the money to pay his tax bill, but what a good actor like Charles Dance did was a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Worst of the worst low budget "B" movie of the 50 and a half hours of suicide and time will never go back to him. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a real plague.
