I can not say I'm so experienced in foggy Mundi tanks that I've only seen a small handful, but obviously this has been equal, and although it may be respectable that the filmmakers were able to rip the Tomb Raider - out Garage, not because it is quite clear that this is what they were doing. The film lasts for only forty-five minutes and this is definitely a good thing because there is not enough plot here to extend it longer. It is a wicked world (seen as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi world at all), a mummy, obviously a man wrapped in a toilet roll and Misty - a copy of this Tomb Raider, which keeps it in the foreground for much less than Angelina Jolie in the big budget version. I must say that despite its shortcomings, this film was the best. I've got Misty Mundae for a start, and even better if you ask me is the fact that it also plays the role of Darian Caine's hottest stars. The couple gets all the homosexuality you expect from Seduction Cinema and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot, although this is not really bad. Obviously this is a nonsense film - but the truth is that it goes back pretty much, and if you're having a little lesbian sex, you can do worse.
