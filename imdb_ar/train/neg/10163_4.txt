When I think of revealing that the main character in "The Bubble" comes at the end of the movies, I remember last year a "mechanic" with Christian Bell. The only difference between the two films is the literal material weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A vivid, yet utterly realistic portrayal of the small town life. Title Reason for meditation. Perhaps, we are the public in the "bubble" where we did not give any rewards in films that run 90 minutes. The reactions of the public have often been arrogant and authoritarian, clearly indicating how individuals who are separated from seeing any thread of humanity can be alienated from themselves. These characters are those that people refer to as those that brought George W. back to office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It makes sense to think about how reality TV has corrupted our sense of reality by watching an audience jump to their feet just to step out of the credits. This film has its advantages, it is worth considering things that are not directly said.
