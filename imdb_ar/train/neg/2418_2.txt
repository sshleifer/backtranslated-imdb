The first mistake you make in writing a movie title is to use "dead living" without having a real zombie budget. Sure, this zombie flick was a low budget - really low budget. I thought it was a movie school project. Amateur representatives and amateur influences. <br /> <br /> It was not too bad given the above and gave an interesting development to the zombie type. If you get a "R" for the violence, it may give us some good shots about the children being attacked. Little women have been used in this film so much that it can be roughly classified as a "gay interest." <br /> <br /> I'm staying outside Oakland. There was a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight!
