Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about foreigners and black gay men who explore the galaxy until they stumble on the ground. Being gay, their goal is to have a male world where all people are gay. Thus, when they discover women or "female creatures" living on earth, they initially feel horrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a gay and lesbian story of homosexuals, although probably a satire, this film gives some shock value. However, there is a small article underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are a few jokes beside the names of the characters (for example ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at one small gay joke. I think I got a point in the movie quickly, satire of bad science fiction, but then I had enough; I kept wanting to end the film already (it's a short film!). Not fantastic or well written.
