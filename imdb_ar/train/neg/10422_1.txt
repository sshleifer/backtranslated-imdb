First, I do not feel easily scared ... anything except a few cases of phobia, but this film is very shocking. This is not suitable for children at all! My mouth was open all the time, it shocked me completely. It does not have to be too awful and I'm in G. I recommend being more than 8 people to see it. But do not get me wrong, maybe it was a good movie if I was not mentally afraid as a child. I can not believe that a parent would allow a 4-year-old to see it. It's just intense and complex, not to forget the wits, for young children. I am over 4 years old and have been shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
