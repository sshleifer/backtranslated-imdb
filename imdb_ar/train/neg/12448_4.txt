Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of the Wild West band, one of six irregular people made up of a struggling tour show. The seventh member of the group is a woman, assistant Billy, but these women did not last long, and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke? Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). Ms. Lilly, as Duck calls her, is a possible successor to her deceased father's father unless she gets married before she turns thirty, and so on the eve of her birthday to cartoonist Jeffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what is the plot of this film? Hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilie, but the problem is that during the first half of the film, she felt so sorry and hated that when she suddenly became "one of the band" in the middle of the film, it was unbelievable, . There is a chronic shortage of funds behind the Wild West show, but the subject has not been addressed enough to be the cause of the film. There is Miss Lilie's trouble in being stranded in rural western areas, isolated from the money that feeds her corrupt life of luxury (she mistakenly believes she has died by her family and the press). But is it supposed to believe that she can not return to New York and her expected fortune if she makes little effort? <br /> <br /> No, it seems that the purpose of this film is that Billy is the leader of a family, a handful of beloved losers who get together and thin. This is a warm and mysterious film? Or at least trying to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, so he foils a bank robbery in shooting away from his place in a relatively violent film. One of the gangs was arrested on charges of evading an old project; Billy bribed the local mayor. The exhibition tent is burning; the orphanage makes it new. But many mundane pitfalls do not constitute a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The problem is compounded by representation, or lack thereof. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the support team is very amateur. Eastwood was not at the top of his game either, although he seemed better off because he was surrounded by such a vulnerable group. <br /> <br /> For all of this, the film continues for 116 minutes. To what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
