A boring film about a boring city in the 1950s. How can anyone think this is a classic? The product ended his career largely by paying his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, to many films that were far above their acting ability. I think this film gives an idea of ​​how bad Peter Bogdonovich's future films are. Cybil Shepard's career took a dive after it was found in many of the films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It was not even "overtime" that her career began to return. I thought representation was a secret rendition of the "graduate". I noticed that this movie has not been shown in the United States. The only place I saw was outside in Europe late at night.
