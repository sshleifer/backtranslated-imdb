This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The representation was awful and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around the evil lesbian who gets wealthy married men to have sex with her, then extort them with money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and an evil lesbian happens to seduce these men's wife too! Meanwhile, the wicked evil friend does not like her sleep. Ends at the happy end where everything is forgiven. Women become very naked, often in situations that extend to reality. Bad Bad Bad.
