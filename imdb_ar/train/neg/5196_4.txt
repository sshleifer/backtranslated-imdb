Although slightly more technologically polished than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, it weakened the escape of a less spectacular plot and a leading man who simply does not have the Ray Milland charisma. <br /> <br /> However, many actors and characters continue in their roles and can keep the flag flying. There is also John Barrymore, where he appeared throughout the film in a variety of alien masks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's another endless night for BD as he and his colleagues chase him and try to save the poor girl he plans to marry. The clues are stupid but again supportive actors often make them amusing.
