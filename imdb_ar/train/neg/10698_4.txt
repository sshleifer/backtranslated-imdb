Darkling was a very enjoyable film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. The spoilers: Halfway through, F.Murray gets off the ground, because The Darkling is a kind of devillike creature that enjoys life indirectly. It takes losers and losers and devours them more while giving them everything they want in terms of success. He feeds on the enjoyment of the seven deadly sins. However, part of it is that it needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. Otherwise it can not "distort" their natural goodness. That's what the little man said in his voice Barry White, whom I found charming and enjoyable. Mostly amusing. Like Barry White imagine if he was a little dwarf and he would say to Aiden Gillen "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Here eet come, Dee Plane!" During the film, Dee Dwarf (actually a robot robot) talks to Aiden Gillen with a voice of Barry White, saying things like "It's good to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed a murder, you're really advancing in the world" and other notes that look like commercials to "Being Evil" shops or something. It's really hilarious in a sick way. <br /> <br /> In any case, Aiden Gillen was not F. Murray Abraham, and the film tanks once Murray got the ax (or knives?). F. Murray brings some good grudge to his role in this film. He is a good actor. On the other hand, Aiden Gillen has a happy happy smile on his face and seems to be Comp Compative English Comp. The class never hit legendary characters and could not imagine what the film was about. The end is really creepy and almost comedic. If this film a parody, the end was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was scary. But a cheap use of a little girl to make a total presentation that the film itself can not deliver. The people who made the film lost everything they wanted to do in a place before the end. They end up just as if they realized they had run out of money and had to shoot a quick movie.
