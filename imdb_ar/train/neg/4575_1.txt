I will admit that I am only a university student at this time, majors in English. While I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I want to say a young but maybe great, hard to remember. My experience in quantum physics goes largely to my physics honor course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field and any article I find in discovery and the like. I'm not a doctor by any means. <br /> <br /> This is said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is simply terrible. It is designed to attract the scientific mind of the New Age teacher who is keen to believe in the excellence of all. My mother is such a person, and since I saw this movie, I tried to make all her friends see him and buy a copy of the movie. I tried to explain the various flaws and problems that I saw in the logic of movies and science - which are numerous - and rejected my claims because "Oh, so you know a high school student more than all people with PhDs." In this case, it seems. <br /> <br /> If we leave behind the fact that obtaining a doctorate does not necessarily require a person to be right or in fact smart. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics suffices to expose half the film. Left behind, filmmakers treated their interviews with at least one of the participants to show that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them. <br /> <br /> I could have followed on but I think intuitor did a really good job in exposing the movie, so feel free to read if you are interested in it. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
