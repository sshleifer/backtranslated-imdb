Is it coincidence that Orca was made after two years of jaws? Orca is not exactly "ruptured Jaws" but obviously he tried to take advantage of the success of the Jaws. First of all, Orca was in my opinion a bad film, not terrible but not definitely good, average at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially a male killer whale (orca) after seeing her companion and her unborn calf killed by a hunter seeking revenge. I could not stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is lousy, and compared to Jaws, it seems that the director, producers and writers are hardly powerless. <br /> <br /> As for representation, it was very mediocre and believable, but the actual characters are not a little less lovable. The effects were fine in time, and killer whale shots looked good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for the most sensitive people. The music is overpriced and loud, drowning sound effects and sometimes irritating. She hated the way she exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not mate with only one partner as described in Orca). <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was bad / bad in my opinion, because of the above reasons. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I will not hit this film and I can understand why some people might like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but probably 5/10)
