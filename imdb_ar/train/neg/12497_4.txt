I'm sure people on the Texas / Louisiana border should have had a good laugh or two when the Paramount's B unit caused this war to be seen in the wartime public. Quite simply the area along the Sabin River where the film is presented is a lumbar country just like the rest of the Deep South or at least it was the Deep South after the Civl War. There are no great empires in cattle, they are located in the far west of Texas, far from Richard Dix and Preston Foster who can ride to establish their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two of them partners in a river boat. When Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services by not paying for their cattle, they keep the cattle. And that's the beginning of the great Ponderosa that starts from the farm. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Francis Gifford, and struggles with his much younger neighbors. They also have some extra additions with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> In any case, we Easterners who love the West usually do not care about the geographical delights and are still good Westerners from the Harry Sherman production plant, all of which produced the Hopalong West Cassidy of Paramount. Its climax is blazing, I mean literally, a gun battle that was supposed to be used to produce A. <br /> <br /> But I will not get anything but Western fans looking at it.
