This is one of the most blurred, weak, non-original and senseless films ever! It seems as if all the participants in this project did not even try to produce an attractive film. This is nothing more than a continuation of a series of tired films that try to take advantage of the success of Smokey and Bandit, which I think is the best film for them all. As for the waste of this film stock, Bert Reynolds sleeps his way through the entire film, Jim Navors is lost, the other actors are not given much, car racing is obviously a stock footage, the uninhibited humor of the scenes is more boring and no The life of staring at the wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is just an unnecessary film that does not feature something unique or distinctive.
