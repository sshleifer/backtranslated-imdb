The idea behind this film was a good idea. Too bad was not written well. Sydney Boyati's selection as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one feelings in most of his films, and anger. It was possible that Kirstie Alley's character would be a wonderful figure; he even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly female impotent. This was not entirely compatible with the strongly independent personality that was supposed to be. I do not care about the behavior of the alley anyway. The film must be over 15 minutes before it ends. Aleppo director cow dry before the final disposition is incredible. I will keep this in my collection just as an example of Poitier's performance.
