This film made me really crazy because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do not have a southern accent here. This film revolves around someone who does not know methane and I do not know the real plot or what the film is supposed to be. She has some very graphic drug abuse and it is really humiliating to even see these people use methyl as it was sugar. I lost my brother because of meth and this film makes me feel sick because of my stomach because it shines drugs. The film makes the drug use drug, but I was happy at the end when the man almost went beyond the limits of the state. I also know that most women who are subjected to painful rape do not want to love their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "Basketball Diary" if you are proposing a film about drugs.
