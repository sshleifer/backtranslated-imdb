Well, that's stupid, they say they do not make another nightmare movie, this is the "last" ... and what do they do? They're going to make another film, not that the next movie (part 7) was bad, but why are they playing with us. However, this film was not logical at all, it was very heavy, and the characters were very one dimension, and Freddie was another clown, and he was so stupid for such a good series. The plot is very bad, and even this is worse than part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a stupid story in 3-d, meaningless! I hated this movie so much I still remember all the parts I did not like which were basically the whole movie. This is completely different from the Barcool, he tries, and tries, but this part tried more than ever before, and then slapped again on the face. There were no death scenes, although they were different, but they absorbed a long time. How could they have gone so far? Did not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in Parts 2 and 5? /> I've got a nightmare on ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> The good points of the film: You have the potential with the plot. <br /> <br /> BAD OF FILM: Very bad representation / lack of mortality / very funny to be categorized as scary / very confusing.
