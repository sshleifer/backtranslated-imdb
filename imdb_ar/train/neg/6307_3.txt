I will give it only 3 because it showed the history we need to know, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the esteemed comments from the UK. The film was terrible too. All cliches, no real plot. Numerous historical and technical inaccuracies. Look for technical specifications on DE 529, or any category of Everts Destroyer Escort, and you'll see what I mean. I am now the month of its black history in the United States, I will call I am racist just to say this, but the history of this ship is not great. They did some guard duty and chased a "submarine" into a huge structure they were shocked by. Sorry, but the blacks did more in World War II, and then this ridiculous film gives them credit for it. This film makes them look like amateurs. Let the contact name begin, I can handle it.
