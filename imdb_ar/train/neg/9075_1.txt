The Slackers As mentioned in this film, they are three friends of Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Marona and Jason Seagel, respectively). They are about to graduate from university without passing a candid examination but finish successfully. This continues to its end when Nathan (Schwartzman) enjoys his charismatic personality but his most remarkable character. Nathan begins to blackmail in order to compensate the girl of his dreams because he can not follow it under normal circumstances. The only problem is that when the trio starts working on him, Dave falls in love with the brilliant and hearty (James King) Angela, unfortunately, is not a great movie. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch the movie because its performance is superb. The performance of King is average, I think they were hired just to be with their wonderful appearance. Little Slackers American Pie in a different direction. The jokes are as shallow as the American Pie. But are not they all used? I think this film is a warning to the kind of filmmakers who are losing their originality. Overall, a few smiley moments but a terrible film in terms of acting (except Schwarzman) and theme. * Away from the place *****
