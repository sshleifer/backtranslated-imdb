Predictable, story-telling a thousand times with the usual drama between them, a couple of horrific sexual scenes mingled with some personal paranoia, the 70-style violin horror music violin that is sometimes comic, I can not help laugh at myself. <br /> <br /> Devo usually likes, and it must be said that acting is not so bad, the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and does not keep you guessing from time to time. Just because it is highly predictable, I felt like I was watching a dramatic film made instead of a new movie. Perhaps this is the way directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before I saw the film could only be written by someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if you can turn the clock back, I will not go to see it in the cinema. You wait for container deals in your video store, I'm sure it will not take long.
