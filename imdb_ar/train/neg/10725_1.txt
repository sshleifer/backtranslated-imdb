As much as I do not like "I'm too" in response to other comments - it is true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the endless drum that includes the next 90. <br /> <br /> Having been blocked somewhere does not result in watching a movie. Just because it does not look like a Hollywood product does not make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse, in addition to the lack of a clear conspiracy (unlike having a lot of muddy places in Russia and lots of people, so very elderly women, drinking lots of vodka) there are a number of unnecessary and unnecessary photos Absolutely in my second group of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers - well, the film is devoid of any subject matter I could not write one if you try. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money, do not confuse it with good Russian cinema.
