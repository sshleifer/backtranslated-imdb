A realistic film, certainly, except for the fact that the characters do not look scared. When Billy Zan tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not look like that. That's why I do not like his performance in this film. Tom Berenger plays again a soldier. No good suspense, realistic sequence. Not always shooting, this is one great thing. Well photographed. I hate the helicopter sequence, because one terrorist kills almost the whole sea package ... I give it ** and half of *****
