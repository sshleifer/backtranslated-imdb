terrible. I see many user comments on how important this offer is. She really wants to be friends - made in Taiwan knockoff. Lame jokes ... and the plot is ridiculous. Obviously, actors are struggling to be funny and may swing when you hit those terrible points (if you can call them). Most of the other users who have been suspended are from another planet (or at least another continent). Obviously, there are reasons TV companies are canceling bids ... Nothing happens when bids are good. Logical? Anyway, go clear - even if the sky is raining and there is nothing else on the planet to do ... go in the rain instead - more fun.
