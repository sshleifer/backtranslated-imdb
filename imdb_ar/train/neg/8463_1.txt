There is no scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> A budget like this ... In Belgium, we make ten films that win all the prices at the Cannes Festival with this . <br /> <br /> The last time you saw NULL-Film was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director is a graduate in a school film or a policeman? <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was "End". <br /> <br /> Why then sell this? 1c expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, paying for it was a big mistake in the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time, I will break my arm but I will buy this kind of pieces.
