The film is a very unusual but sometimes neat exploitation with no real story, but takes advantage of the stunning lead actress and a handful of wonderful and hideous make-up effects. Daniela is a beautiful 20-year-old girl with a shock that she was raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead to more belief that they are the embodiment of a female grandfather who is said to be a wolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nighttime meeting and is brought to hospital. But she runs away again, and indiscriminately devours more men while fleeing for police, doctors and relatives. It's good to look at and listen to music (really fantastic soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity is fast. Fortunately, the leading lady Anik Borel rarely wears her clothes and fills the boring moments with dancing naked around the fire. The film is very long, very strange and can be forgotten. The big surprise comes in the end, when director Renault de Silvestro tries to surprise us that his film was based on real facts. Yes correct...
