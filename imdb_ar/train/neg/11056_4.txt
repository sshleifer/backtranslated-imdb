I was very disappointed in this film. I do not know much about the real story, so I was eager to see it as it was showing films and learning about a small slice of history. With this powerful real story and great actors, it seemed like a sure mix. Well, somewhere a scenario has failed for them. It was very scattered - is this film about his childhood? Love his life? His own disability? His ability to speak? His passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of these things into a good story, but this film was not. I left cool to see the characters who were not likable not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other small grip: 1. Heavy soundtrack. It's the seventies - we've already arrived! 2. If he is a huge public speaker, why not treat more of the excerpt here and there - and even later in the montage?
