I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in The New York Times. In addition, I also Shanghainese so there was more than just passing interest in the subject. However, after watching it, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie speed was very slow and monotonous. The director stayed on some scenes for a very long time. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. There was an urgent need for dialogue to compensate for underrepresentation. At the end of the film, she did not feel any sympathy for the characters. This film lacked everything. The text was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was nonexistent. The director tried to simulate some of the Noir films but failed miserably. A good movie is a movie that draws your attention, keeps it, and manages to finish it without feeling that time has passed. He felt this film as if it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
