The rookie suffers a lot. There are random musical songs interspersed with the film, the long and useless writing of the wonderful squeaking creak to make Jerry Lewis Blush. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to resign. It takes a full hour before the story finally reaches the masterplan and the characters are drowned. The men then begin to play Japanese sailors using contemporary racist caricatures of the day. It is shameful to have the most fun parts of the film when Noonan and Leavitt play with stupid Japanese players. However, it becomes stressful after switching between a set of characters. Then it ends abruptly. Even Julie Newmar is bare with a towel she can not keep. <br /> <br /> There is really little magic in the movie and it is more than half an hour long. The story revolves around trying to prepare funny situations and fail. Stick Martin and Louis. At least Diano had magic and Jerry had that moving face.
