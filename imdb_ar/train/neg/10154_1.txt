How can this movie be 5.5 This movie was a piece of Skunk ** t. At first the actors were really bad I mean the retarded Charlie saw. Because at first he was shaking his head in the wooden hut (he was about a quarter of an inch thick) and he did not even think he could cut it. Second, the person who took the group sucked in the things he had to build with. The only good thing about this movie is the idea this TV shows. Bottom line do not waste your hard earned money on a large piece of ** these they call a movie. <br /> <br /> Category: 0.3
