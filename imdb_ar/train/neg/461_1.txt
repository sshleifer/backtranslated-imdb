WARNING: Avoid this Super Super Sneaky Movie ... if you see it you will be disappointed in SOOOOOOOOO. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are now older, what do they do? She tries hard to be young, innocent and exciting, just not working at all. Both Pam and Denise are horrifying in this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a terrible program, I can not believe that someone can come up with such crazy ideas. With the development of the film industry, cinema lovers are not as easy to satisfy as they were in the last century. I bet filmgoers of the last century will hate this, too. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this. I think watching "White Chicks" from 2004 is so much better that this ... I do not make mistakes at the time and I think it's the worst film I've ever seen.
