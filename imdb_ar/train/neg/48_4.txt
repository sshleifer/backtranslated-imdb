There are some nice shots in this film, capturing some landscapes with such beautiful light, and in fact, cinema may be the best monitor. <br /> <br /> But basically it is more than a television movie, and though it contains a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps its interesting view, there are no translations and major developments are revealed in the plot in Spanish, So Spanish speakers will be left slightly. </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> . <br /> <br /> Although he says in the DVD box that he is a Matthew Mconaughey movie and uses it as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines on the screen not for minutes at the end of the film, it's basically extra and the screen does not completely shine while he's in, Strong fan, ally is not worth it from this point of view. <br /> <br /> Although the movie star, Patrick McGowo is wonderful although very easy on the eye, and his character is very nice, nice and caring, a real saint for someone, it will be well written in com ROM. <br /> <br /> So for the real Maconough who brilliantly shines the ones I've seen, I recommend "The Newton Boys" Frailty, "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" and "Edtv" And "Amistad" and avoid "bigger than life" and "Angels in the Outfield" unless you feel the film children or have children around them do not refer to his talent, but they are completely armed children's movies, and again MM is not really a supporting artist A few lines if any. <br /> <br /> As for Scorpion's Springit Scorpion is not a bad film, but it also does not steal the screen either.
