I have not seen the first two - only this so-called primitive species in England. I do not think I'll be bothered to look for them. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. Terrible representation, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. It's all very bad. The most sympathetic characters die quickly and leave you with the annoying characters, especially those called Polchak, an incredible jerk. No one like this will survive 5 minutes in the army. He continued to live but I was happy when his head was finally chewed - I had nightmares he was about to escape. Col Col was also rubbish - all moody gowns and ignorant yelling. The doctor looked abnormal and acted as if she were out of porn. I was waiting to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a patch, but she did not. It is unfortunate that, as it would have animated the film endlessly. <br /> <br /> Roger Korman was not used to produce half of decent films at once?
