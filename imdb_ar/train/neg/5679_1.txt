I was very disturbed by the real shots at the beginning of the film so much that I felt nauseated on my stomach and ended up closing the film. How can anyone give this movie more than one rating amazes me. I know the film is meant to be shocking, but showing real footage of a dog that has been painted alive (restrain vomiting while writing) - please! He closed it after the scene with the decomposed child. I had covered my eyes most of the time until this point. No wonder this film was found in the bargaining box at HMV. I really do not want to see any other film for this person Uwe. Anyone who enjoys this needs treatment. interval.
