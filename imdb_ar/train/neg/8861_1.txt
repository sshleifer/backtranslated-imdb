The dreadful horror sequel to "Howl". This begins with the funeral of Karen White (killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosco (Christopher Lee sadly) arrives there and Karen's brother (Reeb Brown) tells Karen that Karen was in despair. He is going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) with a werewolf in the head. Ben and a colleague join him in working with Caryns (Annie McEnroe). <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario, bad steering, incompetent editing and a truly terrible act by Brown and McEnroe are drowning in this. Wound effects are mostly kept in the dark - and for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects also - although I did like a lightning cartoon that comes from Danning's fingers. There is also an orgy that feels particularly stupid and that Dunning takes off her head at least eight times during the closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are some goodies - the village in Transylvania is entertaining - it seems to have come from a global horror bout of the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe enjoy good bodies while Lee and Danning enjoy good in this - but they can not save it. Really - why did they do this? Where they are difficult for money ?? This is one of the least rated IMDb movies. This alone should tell you something. Daning is supposed to have felt terrified when I watched the movie - I can understand why! Must miss.
