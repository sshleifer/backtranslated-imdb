With the exception of the varied Brady watch, this was one of the most television shows I have ever seen. The quality of the video production was not very bad, but the overall appearance and appearance were in the early 1980s. And Mary Osmond seems to have fought a battle with Mrs. Avon .. and lost a lot of time. WAY a lot of eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was an embarrassment to watch the veterans Danny Kay and Eric Seafrid participate in it. More interesting is the view of Alex Halley speaking about the African pavilion at the world fair, which opens "within a year." (Unless you count the kingdom of Disney animals.) All in all, despite all the shortcomings, this is still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
