I was very excited for this film when I first saw the previews. I usually see a good preview of this and buy the whole movie. He said something to me ... you know how to see him first. I'm glad I did. Kira Knightley destroyed all future films for me with this role. In the second pirate film when I went out to see him. All I saw was Domino Harvey and her hatred more for that. I think it was about her hair and the need for his story with the dominoes. <br /> <br /> Domino Who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or really care. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I did not care about her character and even Kira, who became partially naked did not make it worth the film. The trend was certainly not there. The writing was vulgar and shallow. The editing was terrible. I do not mind the style as much as the excessive misuse of it. There is a place for it. A good example of checkered, MTV style, color editing (not sure if there is a formal name) would be the Fight Club; off the top of my head. Even the enemies of the state had a similar semi-liberal editing style in the parts. It was used tastefully and was not used as a casserole. I mean this is the same guy who brought out Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott Please give me my time. <br /> <br /> I understand there are a lot of people who liked this movie. I think the idea that you will love this movie completely or totally hate it is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
