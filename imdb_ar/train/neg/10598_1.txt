This piece of s-t !! This sounds worse than making a TV movie. I shutter to believe that the sequel even concealed the results ... The most beautiful war of this. Jean-Claude van Schaein did it again and wondered why he was now career. No text, no story, no time should be wasted. I mean this. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg must draft them for this purpose. The shame is not representative.
