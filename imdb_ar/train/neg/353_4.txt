Other reviewers also noted that the film died in the last 1/2 hour. However, before that he suffers from the predictability and amazing performance of Kate Cabshaw, who obviously did not find her character and destroy every scene she is in. Connery is fine like Fishburne, but most of the scenes are treated in order to influence rather than the fact that the entire overlay is feeling unrealistic. The end is simply curious. The filmmakers obviously knew when they combined this mess together that all they needed was sweet potatoes and a pumpkin for Thanksgiving dinner, so they compensated for adding a "dramatic" score. Accompanying each little jump is mounting the orchestra, so that it becomes laughable. If you want to get an example of a bad movie in the league, you'll find it well, otherwise skip it.
