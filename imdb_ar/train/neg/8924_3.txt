I've been disappointed to see this DVD after many years. For me, the main problem is the unequal scenario. <br /> <br /> While some of them are adept and hip, a large part of it is dull and ruthless. Sitting a lot of gags there, lacking spark and energy. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, May West and Rachel Welch come well. Roger Herren shines as Rusty (very bad that he did not make more films). But for my money, there is a lot of John Houston, and poor Rex Reid barely gets a chance to fight. His character seems to have landed on the sidelines, wondering what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> A low user rating should give an idea of ​​the audience's opinion in this piece. The original Vidal presented a lot of potential that was wasted a lot. Not even the "classic" movie clips did much. All in all effort is substandard and is not likely to improve over time.
