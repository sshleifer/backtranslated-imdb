As you grew up, Joe Stromer was my hero, but I left this movie cool. For the better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a clear documentary "Behind the Music". Instead, it is a biographical film, full of interviews, performance shots, home movies, and many senseless animations that have been lifted from the Animal Farm. The film is coherent, but runs for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The form of fire during his contact with thought is very annoying in execution. First, without nicknames, it's hard to even know who half of them were interviewed. Second, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Kozak in the mouth licking obsessions about men? Were not related to Stromer's life and their views did not add anything to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is at best when Stremer, through interviews and recorded conversations, touches aspects of his life that most people do not know about: the suicide of his older brother, the death of his parents, and the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were moving so much because they did not show Joe Stromer as a punk that we all knew and loved, but as a normal man he had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life that we all had to face. <br /> There were better and clearer documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder cited the MTV documentary from the early 1990s). Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for retirees only.
