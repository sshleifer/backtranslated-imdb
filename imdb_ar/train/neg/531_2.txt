With a cast list like this, I was expecting much better. Venessa Ridgrave spent most of the film lying on the bed. The best actresses in the world can not make anything interesting when their representation is limited to lying down and sleeping throughout the entire film. The plot's summary says that a secret has been revealed to the girls because his mother is approaching death. The thing is that she does not tell her daughters anything but a hidden tip to be happy. All relations in the film lagging behind. I also felt that back and back between past and present was not necessary. The idea seems to have been stolen either from Da Vinci Code's use of the device to increase suspense, or from The Notebook, where they used the device to create a never-ending romantic story for the characters of the main story. In both cases it was a cheap device in this film because it did not succeed in creating anything. It was a way to try thrill in a movie that has nothing. I left wondering why you can not write good movies for women. It was really a disappointment.
