I have seen many wonderful and wonderful films in my life. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I certainly have something to say about it. First, these actors are the worst I have seen ... Their actions are so unrealistic that you want to get rid of the DVD in the first two minutes. I think these representatives were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> There is something else bad about these dialogues - they are very lame. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. Your 14-year-old son may be acting better. I feel that this film has a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if you get my message - save your time and money.
