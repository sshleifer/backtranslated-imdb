It's a very silly film and has little to do with slavery in the West Indies and is starring in Seudfeld's Puddy! Patrick Warburton made his first film in this twisted film and is noticeably thinner here. Oliver Reid got the best bills but barely in the film at all. Warburton plays a white and funny role to see all the wives rumor and admit the rich old men who are competing for him because they want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of Bordello and is a nudity in the film many. If the drunken orgasm is not in the bordello their young wives sit with him. Then of course in the end the slave rebellion and there is a bloody dilemma. There is no real political message like "Burning" but just another fabricated conspiracy to move the story. Incredibly they made a sequel to Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! I hope they get a lot of money because this first film is very bad. Nudity keeps it viable and Lack of Warburton in any tone makes it funny at times. Very bad film but I got to admit that I wanted to see the sequel.
