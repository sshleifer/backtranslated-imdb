Note You all book an emerging film: Study this movie. If your dialog box reads like a dialog box in this movie, please tear up the script and try again. <br /> <br /> I did not have great expectations, but I was intrigued by the description that indicates a puzzle in the Christmas decorations factory. The puzzle is solved very early and the film becomes a direct love story. I stopped watching it in about 5 minutes and 10 minutes and at the first break. My wife, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, surrendered at the first break. <br /> <br /> Forrest River is the city of the company - the main business is the Oakens Orleans, which performs all types of holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company has recently died, so the future of companies may be questioned. We soon meet Noel, who prefers to be on Wall Street more than Main Street, and Mysterious Justin, who meets Noel after a big snowman hit by a Justin's car. Once we meet with Allison Aikens, and do due diligence to the Council, we have prepared our story. <br /> <br /> If you can not install all the story brackets by the first commercial break, you will not see enough of that kind of holiday movie. Maybe this is a good thing.
