Black and white film. Good photography is believable characters. <br /> <br /> Just awesome. <br /> <br /> I missed another perfect evening watching a movie rated "Worth" and "Very Good". There are some good behaviors here and the back ground preparation is good (it should have been done more) but it is too slow to grow and never develops. It rules perfectly on sex without too much romance with too much nudity not necessary. More can be done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to see with your family, you will not have trouble sitting in it. Although this film is only a long deep about 1 inch!
