You already know how much pain in watching this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should ever include one of the most beautiful cars. Why not only should cars be the victims of the violation, but must be the only actors and real performers in them. How about Porsche or Lamborghini or anything that can allow these people to connect to your cars and spoil your reputation, which gives millions of them. It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want to restore my money !!!
