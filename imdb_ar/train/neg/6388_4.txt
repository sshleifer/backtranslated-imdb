The Brothers' Quarters are the directors, according to traditional thought, who must be committed to making short films. Personally, I really liked her first feature, the Benjamenta Institute, but based on their effort in the second year, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I am willing to agree that they are not close to equating the genius of their past with the length of the feature. Piano Tuner, without a doubt, is a wonderful film to look at and often listen to. Unfortunately, it's a painful line to stand with his complex story and ice speed. When reading the plot summary, the story looks very good. But the Brotherhood failed miserably to bring life back to life. There is one thing that they should think about avoiding altogether in the future: dialogue. Oh my God, it's terrible here. Bust huge.
