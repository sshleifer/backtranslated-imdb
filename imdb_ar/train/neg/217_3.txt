This film relies only on the somewhat controversial picture of incest and lesbianism to be observed. That's it. The dialogues are pathetic and the meaning of "sex scenes" is completely absent. Representation and representation are more suitable for high school children, however, the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a film without fog. It would have been much better if he had had a story and more drama. Moreover, there is something else: why are internal monologues used excessively? Makes it look very cheap. In all the embarrassing films of Romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences trying to watch it. I know the resources are scarce, but this is not always an excuse for a movie floundering as it does. Please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling from musicians (Theodore Cheryla) - they can not act!
