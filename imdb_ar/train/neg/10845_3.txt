The plot was a surprise! ;) I've seen less plot films (I do not want to mention Asian movies but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a movie as cheap as this, and the atmosphere was not too bad. There is no real reason for most things people do and how they react to what happens. Although I think it's about a lot of movies, in this case it was terrible, of course. <br /> <br /> Some movies have ripped very badly for individual scenes. The acting was bad but I saw the worst. The film was bad but I saw what was worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter, the desire for death, sadism, horns and low-level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So, if you love bold films with stupid plots, this is the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I have given it 3/10, because it can be amusing if you do not expect watching a good movie and you are in a good mood.
