These two points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films are not striving to be realistic but please have a Walt Disney production more realistic than this plot. The father dies and does what any good parent does ... expels his son from his pregnant wife. Some things that were too hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka "cool indoor pool in the bedroom" and moving from that to living hungry in the shed of her garden ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, bitten by the mutilated dogs, and then just came out. This film is an inspiration to our minds, and I do not really believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who made this film by taking my family to see it, and we left the cinema with frown, please do not subject yourself to this mess to watch this Take my advice and do not waste your time.
