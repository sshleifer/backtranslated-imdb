I saw the original German version not dubbed and was surprised by the extent of the damage of this film. I think I saw my share of bad films like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and so on, I could not promise me that! It is really painful to sit in this light, because there is no plot, there is no good representation, even special effects are not convincing, especially so-called zombies who do not wear more than white make-up and their old clothes, so a good set will not be destroyed by patches Sauce and oranges. <br /> <br /> If you really want to miss 90 minutes of your life, look for others, do not, because you will regret it!
