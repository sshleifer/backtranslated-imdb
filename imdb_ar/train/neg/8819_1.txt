This is by far the worst awful piece of fool I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> These films show that some people get dressed and dressed when they wear Santa Claus clothes and kill people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while wearing Santa Claus. That's why he went crazy? Is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for a crazy person like ever? This is not the only thing. I'm serious when I say nothing happens in this film. Nothing even passed an hour and 15 minutes from it. <br /> <br /> There is an entire friggin scene where the screaming beard of Santa Friggin screams. It's FIGGIN MINUTE LONG. Who wants hell to see it? However I must say that the end of this film made me nonsense myself laugh at it. So if you see this movie on TV or something is returned within an hour and only 20 minutes to see without a doubt the worst end in movie history. I am serious about that. <br /> <br /> It's not so good, it's boring, it's stupid, it made me want to break the video. It's not worth your time either, I'm sure every other review mentioned that but the actress who played the role of the mother on the home improvement was in this movie for a second. Want to know how bad this film is? I'd better watch home improvement for sixty-six hours until I looked at these films covering again.
