I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. After 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay to the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I loved Jean Hughes Anglade, but I think he needed to eat, like us, so he had to play before this film. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, the rest can be called "art" or something I could not express, but I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The worst film I saw was the crash, but I'm sure now that I have enough experience to see it again. <br /> <br /> Good luck !! ; s)
