This movie is really wonderful. By triviality to crap at such a speed that you do not even see the common sense and common fitness of mankind go in the past. But it does not stop there! This film hits the bottom of the barrel so hard that it reverts to the ridiculous comedy point: Here is the Curse of the Perguted Conan, wooing with the abundance of neck hair whose objects swirl as he swings his sword as there is no tomorrow (and the way he oscillates, I'm really amazed there) * was * Tomorrow for him, or at least for his own beer delicacy). Do not miss this movie, it's a wonderful thing through crap, pure bloody mind! Once you have seen this one, tears of joy (or tears of frustration in such an inexperienced attempt at telling stories) dry out of your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
