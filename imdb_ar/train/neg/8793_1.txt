For those who decide whether to watch this movie or not and read these comments for foresight, I first introduce these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was filmed poorly, slapped together quickly and looked as though it had been fully conceived by someone standing in line at King Kong Kong Burger. I can not ever remember watching a movie with a variety of these one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through this mundane scenario! It is a silly attempt with a philosophically ironic dialogue (a man walking around in his flood-flooded apartment offering the astonishing revelation that "tears can be dried with a handkerchief, but water takes time to get rid of"). As you see the same personality and it carries a deep and meaningful relationship with his face, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, and so on. The shaking camera that was wandering by hand was another annoying feature I could have done without. If that is not enough for you to be surprised by popcorn, we will hear the old 1960s poem "California Dreaming" by Mamas and Babas outperform the soundtrack over and over again in a very long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I can not all my life find out why a man was annoyed by his talent. He was known to have commented: "I'm happy to love a film that much." However, many of us hope to focus on making their audiences happy with interesting discoveries in the future.
