Horror film ?? Oh really ???? I can not believe how bad this film is, what is the purpose of this film ??? The film is almost an hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it, is just Lina wandering around with this stupid look on her face after an accident .... Do not talk much at all, not even a lot of actions at all .. I must say that, In the last 20 minutes, I got a little little action .. and it was still stupid ....... and the end, my God, I do not know where to start, it ends up with a stupid look on lena face lol .. do not get me well I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress, but I do not know what he went into to do this movie .. Do not waste your time and watch because, this film has no story, it has no representation .. and has no benefit ... Not to mention how slow this film, and you seem to see it forever.
