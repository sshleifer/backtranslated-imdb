It seems like you've dealt with the general themes in The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, and have taken all its forms, class and mix with a lot of new wave buzz. "I think so it should be difficult to understand my film" The Garbage Maker, mashed in a few extra styles for good Measure, cut off the end, there you have a gun. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have thought about it for a short time after seeing it, and yes it was nice to make sense, but that does not prevent it from garbage. <br /> <br /> A waste of money. waste of time. <br /> <br /> There is the worst movie I have ever seen, even with no good value for a new movie to replace it a bit.
