Quentin Chris once said that when things are displayed very beautifully, the romantic one. When things appear unbearably gloomy, they are realistic. When something happens to cynical treatment, they discover it. Unfortunately for Leon de Arnaud, he falls into the second category. It is clear that this director tried hard to produce a Spanish film "Ken Loach", without being able to pick up comedy, and warmth between the characters, which raise the films of Loch from being just "bleak." Los Lunes al Sol, is so, just depressed. Things are unrealistically bleak. The final moments of misery come to a climax at the same point, and if the story of the luster is not enough, Aranwa will wash the story with a gray and attractive palette. The movies were ridiculously overpriced in Goias. The film, which shows empathy for the weaker citizens of society, in this case the unemployed port workers, does not make a good film automatically, although I will be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. He manages this film only to make me uninterested in their fate. In Spain in the 21st century, unemployed people, such as beggars, do not live. Public transport has adequate latrines, and it is difficult to find them in a bar with very few pioneers and the meager happiness to face them. It is clear that Leon de Arnaud has no idea of ​​the working class in Spain, nor does he prefer it. Buzz is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watched a free football match was directly copied from a film dealing with the subject of "poverty" much more "realistically", a "Purely Belter", which is more attractive, humorous, yet sad.
