Good Lou gives all he has in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little other value. Completely lacking in sexual excitement, excitement, or leadership of ladies with appeal. One decent battle, a few moments of moderate thrill. And a one-note outline. <br /> <br /> The film is a philosophical wax in a series of conversations between Law and violent killers, and Timothy Spall played well. However, despite all possible efforts, both actors are associated with the rigidity of the usual film. <br /> <br /> With a less important actor in the lead role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis - crocodiles are mixed in the sea of ​​low budget vampire quickies.
