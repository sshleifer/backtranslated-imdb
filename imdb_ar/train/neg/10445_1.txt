This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, the text pathetic and the biggest question is how this low-pitched script got the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like to kill all kinds of movies from deep dramas to males more what you see kind of movies, so I can not say I'm picky. I have found it difficult to find something to compare it to, but I can not think of anything that matches that, probably the 2 vehicle soldiers. The witch in my opinion makes the gods of the cinema cry as I think of getting rid of the DVD player, but compared to these great effects. It should behave wonderfully and script. You know when a movie is funny in a funny way, well, this is not one of those who kill your soul minute by minute.
