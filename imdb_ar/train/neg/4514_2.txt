The problem lies in the book "Memoirs of the Geisha" that it contains Japanese surfaces but under the surfaces was the way of thinking of an American man. Reading the book is like watching a wonderful ballet with great music, collections and costumes played by the animals in the yard wearing these costumes - so far the Japanese ways of thinking were the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie is not about Japan or the real army. It is a story about some erroneous American ideas about Japan and Shisha that have been filtered through their ignorance and misperceptions. What is this film if it is not about Japan or the army? Is it just a fantasy as many people have said? Yes, but why has it turned into an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were a lot of missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no rigid suspensions, no signs of sin about sex. Sex is natural and natural. How is sex treated in this film? right. As if it were dirty. The closest thing to a sexy scene in the film is the curling of Saiuri from her nose and stacking it for five seconds as if the man he was trying to install had dropped a handful of cockroaches on the crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone enjoy sex in this movie? Both. One character is said to be dysfunctional, but all we see is pushing her away to her lover because she does not seem to want to be preoccupied with doing something dirty. Such typical American extremism has no place in a film about the Japanese Army. <br /> <br /> Did Syori enjoy her first fascination with some old bloggers after selling her cherries by auction? Both. It lies there like a cool slab of meat on a chopping piece. Of course you are not supposed to enjoy it. That's what I mean in this film. Why did not they give her something to enjoy? Why should all sex be sinful and sinful? <br /> <br /> Behind Mamah, the president was Syria's secret patron, and as such was behind her virginity auction. He could have forged the auction and won it himself. Nobu did not even try. Why did the President allow her to win the old blogger, and get rid of the smell of the old man and scrape his fingers on her naked body? Will any woman really forgive any man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand this. By being behind Mama, the chairman of the board incurred Dion to train the army on Al-Saori. To repay his debt, the president sold Syori to Dr. Crab. Through Mamaha, the president sold the sexual benefits of Saori to this old man so that the president can reap some money from them. The president was not her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love stories. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is great, but it looks like a very attractive and seductive sexy beauty, its voice, its appearance and every touch. But under this very feminine surface lies the ominous secret. Under the apparent Japanese surface of the film lies the ominous secret that the heart of this film, its spirit, spirit and essence is entirely American. Not the best it can be if it tries to be non-lying, mocking and horrible mistake. <br /> <br /> Some inconsistencies between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Refined, and elegant simplicity. Wave pattern? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> The Japanese Army? Wash hair. Long live the army? The loose hair that was sure to have got all the thick spots in a paste of white make-up. <br /> <br /> Japan's jade-Japanese ice is fairly strict in relation to seasonal celebrations. Ice shaving is a thoroughly summer treat. MOAG Shaved Ice - Chairman of Chiyo, a young Saiyori who plays the brilliant Suzuka Ohjo, buys this experience during the cherry blossom watching season. Make my whole body thought trembling from the cold. <br /> <br /> The Japanese Army? Artists trained and skilled. MOAG GESHA - Sluts. <br /> <br /> The Japanese wind is used in the summer because the sound of its sound, thanks to the breeze, makes the Japanese feel rather cold. MOAG wind chime - doorbell! If someone stands in front of another house and makes sounds that are in tune with the wind, it will be considered a crazy entry, not a gain. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Focus on human relations, group oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a royal life" individual American. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Refined elegance. Engineering and mechanical precision approx. The magic dance of Martha Graham shudders on the LSD while wearing a very unapproachable white Japanese funeral. Performed by the giraffe down a ramp in a place resembling a strip club? Ha ha ha! Is Naseem Club where they did most of their research about al-Jisha? <br /> <br /> Fire house Japan ?? A fire or even a fire is worse than killing because it poses a serious threat to society. The fires can tear down villages, towns and wooden towns that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill as many people as possible. Fire house MOAG - a wonderful accessory to a fighting place but there are no ramifications and because there is no longer a need to shoot out of control miraculously. Technically, the film ended here because at least Suryi had been ostracized and joined her sister among those who had never heard of them again. Where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall are to be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough is enough. The film stinks.
