Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed the monkeys. The monkeys funny. People with memory loss who do not say much, just sit there with vacant eyes are not all funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is no black person in them, there is nothing funny about it. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things in some way and places them on a dollar rack. They have been incorrectly categorized. I think they took the scene naked. Maybe they took out other things too, who knows? All we know is that whatever happens, there is nothing more. <br /> <br /> The acting was good for me. There is a lot of shame. Is supposed to be a city? Is it supposed to be a big lake? If the atmosphere is very hot in the church, people will spread to themselves, why wear all the coats?
