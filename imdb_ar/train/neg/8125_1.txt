"The People People" is a really bad film worthy of MST3K treatment just like the other film "The Creeping Terror." <br /> <br /> In it, we are in a kind of mountainous terrain full of bats. See many things happen, like bats that fly and attack objects, station wagon chases, accidents in the emergency room, and much more! All this, in addition to the poor quality of cheese in the seventies (hey, think of "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" one of the best episodes of the latest Mystery Science series produced in this series! Moviewise, it's awful. You should avoid it like a plague, unless Tom Cervo and Crow watch you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 Of course!
