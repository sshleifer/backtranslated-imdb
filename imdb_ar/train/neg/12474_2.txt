I watched Deathstalker III's MST3K and I liked the movie so much - so "unsettling" - that I decided to watch the whole series of Deathstalker movies. I bought I and II and settled for laughter. <br /> <br /> Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was funny on any level and when the credits fell I was embarrassed and sorry because I bought it! Much ugliness and nudity. I think "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or MST3K already edited a lot because I expected something similar, like stupidity and delusion. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it looked like a waste of money. I did not open the "DS 2" until I will return tomorrow. Now, maybe I will throw this DVD because I can not bring it back and nobody wants it - including me! Really, do not bother with this one. Even nudity (much of it, BTW) is inspiring and inspirational.
