How have I never seen or even heard about this unwanted film before? He is right in my snakes with bloody figs, funny layout and irresistible atmosphere in the eighties around him. For some reason no one really cares about him, the employees and students of Catholic University are killed by an unknown psychopath. The newly appointed teacher Julie Parker becomes involved when all the people you communicate with become dead or act strangely. This movie is very bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally important to others. For example, a girl was killed and her body was thrown into a container. Then, for no reason, the story suddenly moves forward three weeks later, but the murdered girl is not mentioned or even missed. Not even by her boyfriend! The representation is pathetic and there is not even a little nudity to enjoy. The killer revelation is very funny because the makers seem really convinced that it was the original twist ... it's not, guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror turkeys ever.
