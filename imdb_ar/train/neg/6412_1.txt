I just came back from the film and I feel totally terrified. This film is the absolute irony of all humanity. Maybe it was in the theater where I was 4 other people. This film was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person was impressed with it. I can not believe that any rational person would. There was no plot no plot at all. it was a joke. How do you make a movie about nothing. This film goes only to show Hollywood's cause in such anarchy. I can just take a look at the industry spiral horror film and laughter. What a joke of all the films, this applies to all the "teen horror films" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw. All this is garbage. Do not support this kind of hogwash!
