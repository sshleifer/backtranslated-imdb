I really wanted to watch this movie, and I waited months to get it through the Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, it was thrown directly into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which made me angry. I will give any movie a chance, even if I want to exit the theater / press "Stop". I watched him all the time, but I got nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good, but it was about him. Nothing Demonstrated While we understand that Mathieu is depressed and falls into some sort of psychic wing, we never know his "fall". While we understand that he and Cedric are separated, again, we do not see this happening or why it happened. During an interview with Matthew's doctor, Cedric reveals that he once tricked him, but it was not much. I was expecting to see this in the memories of the past, but not - nothing. We also received hints that Cedric was the person who brought Mat to the hospital - but again, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the films are "Take It Like It", but this film believed me. When Pierre appears, Cedric's former club and problems begin, do not see him hide or his hair until near the end, and it took a considerable amount of time to find out that Pierre was the former. His character in the club and when he finds Matt is completely different. I might be wrong to say this, it was confusing. <br /> <br /> The movie expects to know everything and be in line with its separate and confusing speed. I can keep up with movies like "Pi", "Citizen Kane" and other movies that have past memories / flash forward left and right, but the CU did not pick up the patterns and stick to them. At the end of Citizen Kane, you know what's going on and discover the answer to the key secrets. CU just leaves you hanging. It contains excuses in his presentation "We are not telling you something damned, discover it yourself." It is like reading a book with a switch of chapters and missing pages. <br /> <br /> Good behavior, as I said. I loved the characters, but the whole story was very disappointing.
