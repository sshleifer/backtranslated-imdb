I'm a very non-political young man, so when I say that I mean sexual, that really means that he is reducing the women's lead, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Moldar. Despite all that is supposed of her brilliance and self-control, there is nothing inside her but a big jealous child unreasonable. You've got this plot now, after her artistic friend Marvik, a shabby granny, overcame her when he tried to kill Maidan, Ambassador Kolos, out of jealousy , But first glance instead. (She believes he could have entered the room by closing his eyes and closing the box gradually, which is very easy). He takes the institution in a non-galactic space before the boys can subdue it. Well, the ship was in limbo, and at this point it was possible to go to and discuss the good communication lady. "Spock has to mix the mind with the field so that we can go home, I mean like beets, do you want to stay on purpose until the supplies run out and die?" But the real Star Trek woman is a jealous monster who grumbles and yells when the idea is put up, even when her lover in the field told her to keep quiet and communicate with her. So the beet comes out of the mess with the Spock mixed, making him forget to wear his mask making Spock reap. Kirk, of course, discovered what was the total anger she was and exposed in the repair of "Spock" with its super power. Of course, in the end, Mrs. and Susan leave and forgive everything. I almost wished that the president of Battle Star Galactica appeared to give up the witch from the airway because of her destructive tricks. But in Star Trek, women are allowed to be completely irrational and cruel, but at the same time there is supposed to be sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexual prejudice.
