Slow, boring and very repetitive. No wonder Weinstein did not buy this. This Spurlock must eat more McDonalds while filming himself, and taking off production. There is no way you can watch this and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a film with this exact idea rather than an advantage. I'm very sorry I hired this movie. I will not see anything with the name Spurlock on it. It's completely garbage. Moviemakers must be on YouTube and not given a distribution deal. The film states that American consumers and shopping are at fault from the current depression when shopping and buying products, and making money circulating in the system is the basis of the health economy.
