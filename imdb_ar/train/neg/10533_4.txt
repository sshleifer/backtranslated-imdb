This version moves very slowly to my taste and I assume that I have problems in this game to get started. But first the film, is a typical television movie version of the play which means that it does not have the original version of the film with William Holden. What can they afford to hire more than a dozen people as add-ons? Why did the film move until 1966? Can the little sister give a line about the Vietnam War protests? Why not 1963 and give it a line around the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the actors, some of them have some hopes. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his own character with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand misses a lot of notes. He is believed to be a former JOCA for the BMOC, but he has little passion for William Holden. I've always thought that Brolin was somewhat like a gorilla to make all the women in the town wear the monkey on it (excuse me for the pun). Gretchen Moll was beautiful but she seemed very wise for the character she played. The patent or the ignorance required by the individual is not signed. Perhaps this is because she and Proline were about five years older than the characters. But again, Holden was ten years old. Bonnie was an unforgettable dream because the mother and Mary Steinbergen could not decide whether to play Blanche DuBois or Catherine from Taming of the Shrew. <br /> <br /> For Mr. Inge, I have always felt that such stories about a young woman who chooses her passion for practical application always need an end. "The Twilight Zone" I think it offers a possible potential episode with a "Spur of the Moment" episode where Diana Highland was chased by older Diana and Hayr, because younger Diana Highland chose to escape with a man similar to Hal Carter.
