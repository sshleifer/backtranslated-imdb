I did not expect this to be a great film, but I did not expect it to be a very bad film. I hated the mother so much that I had to turn the channel. I have brought it back, hoping it will be just one part of the film, but no. And the babysitter to sit there take the embarrassment, or almost completed work, or driven to madness inside her home? are you kidding me? I grew up to respect my mother (and even fear) but I quickly set her up at the nearest hotel if she proved to be annoying in my house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all. <br /> <br /> I did not buy any of them. I tried to give it many opportunities, I already did. Sorry.
