For months before the release of this movie, I saw it being advertised in all types of print media, so I waited patiently to release its video to see what all this noise was. After it ended, I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying a VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a terrible film. It's basically a failure because it's a character-based film about irreplaceable characters. With a possible exception to Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is Amanda Peet), you can not stand on any of them. The film is based on his dialogue, which was sultry, spiritual and bland. The only energetic character is Eric, whose picture has died of the only member who married a group of friends. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of discontent towards Peet. All in all, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
