If I could give it less than 1 I would. Do not bother to hire; if someone gave you a DVD, burn it. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film. A complete waste of a digital "film". I've seen the best on YouTube made by 12 year old boys. Lomile claims to have written this, if so, a classic case of a bilingual illiterate person. The storyline does not exist, and the dialogue is mainly screaming, and the camera's work is a kind of solicitous art attempts with irrational pieces of hops unrelated to industrial transport scenes or some kind of strange angry rift. I usually follow a plot less than clear or see the purpose in the film "Creative" - ​​I love David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This film is either far from my limited comprehension abilities that I missed or it is totally useless. I think this is "let's see if we can get a title soon and make a strange rift and see if we can grab some dollars." con. <br /> <br /> I can not see why Lionsgate is bothering this. No value at all, it is very bad that I will not hire anyone else by this same director.
