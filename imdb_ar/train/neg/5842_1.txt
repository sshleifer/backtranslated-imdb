What a terrible film. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with title sequences, but this movie is as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around turning rats into monsters and going into the killing spree. The acting is not so bad, but the script is useless, and the film is not so scary despite music in the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some groups have pumped this bag out of garbage and thought it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie. It's a trash can, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! One in ten.
