I had great expectations for this indie after seeing many excellent reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are two additional "years" for the already published and excellent review "Lost in Translation". Hypothesis: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty little town where he meets a beautiful crimson who works at a local supermarket. Could Morgan help in raising the beautiful scarlet of her trash life for the trailer? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? Not. What about this shopping in the target. First, Freeman looks at the inner goal as if he had entered Harrods. Then, he rode on a T-shirt holder to confirm that he had never seen in any shop visited by the beautiful Scarlet. Morgan is separate from any aspect of scarlet reality and is portrayed as delightful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlett's life. <br /> <br /> One of the reviewers enjoyed the spectacle of Scarlett and barbaric skill where she survived, a car in this case, requiring physically attacking her ex-physically. Freeman is rushing to her defense .... Unnamed: He cries in disbelief and is completely unable to deal with such an outspoken aspect of her very real and dismal life. <br /> <br /> Freeman believes that car wash and a new blouse are very narrow, the key to meeting Scarlet's work. Another sign that Freeman is wise. The "Progressive Talk" does not end for Freeman where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to phase or other related Freeman's troublesome experience. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right to assert that Scarlett is small in front of her, and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces: uneducated, inexperienced or white-collar, VERY POOR, no support family and a lifetime of low self-esteem . Scarlett learns life lessons from Freeman such as: Some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt, and may open a revealing blouse rather than lack of education and work skills in a white collar. In the end, Freeman Scarlett offers more than a strange leak with a star, and does not even pay for gas for Scarlett's death at night to her unchanging life in a city where Freeman does not care.
