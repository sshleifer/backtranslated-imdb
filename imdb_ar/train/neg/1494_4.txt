Yes, definitely better than my point of death. In fact some of the deaths were original and Gur was decent. It was like "Wrong Turn" that meets Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> But: 1.) When "children" (high school or college?) discuss horror movies in the kitchen, all Shae says is almost an exact quote from Cry (1996). The thing about big girls tits etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Steve Randy Boatleg was not yelling? 3.) In addition to the fact that it happened in October, what is the hell with the film? It is unnecessary if you ask me. I find it funny when I see these horror films of the 1980s that explain the loose endings by pointing fingers at the priests or pentagon. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow they made a remy remix signal !!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the film? The characters have nothing to do with anything. Hes so psychic that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at that point, the deaths simply became illegal). How could she hear the scream when she was downstairs but did not hear her when she was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - this was primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is if you like Shae and you do not have any fun or break a smile through the whole movie, you'll be the one to live? 9.) The mutations were wonderful, but they were like walk-in chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, they forgot that Steve HAD was tethered there and wondering where he went? 11.) There was not more than one killer? I overcame it, but never met them. <br /> <br /> 12.) What was with the past memories of these other people? Half of them did not know whether they were dead or alive. What was that? 13.) Why did not Gary and his sister be killed before? 14.) Why did no one call the police? Everyone seems to know that these people were living in the forest, why they did not organize a raid of some kind? 15) As far as I know, they were not Zombies or vampires - how to "turn into" one in the end? I'm with anyone else on the giant "huh?" In the end. <br /> <br /> The road is better than the death tunnel, but it is still very dirty. I still do not understand why they put him up in Ireland, considering that Samhain had nothing to do with the plot.
