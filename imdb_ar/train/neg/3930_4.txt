In the second Renaissance, Part 1, let us illustrate how machines first arose against humans. It all starts with one situation, in which the machines claim to have the right to live as well, while the human states that the robot is something he owns and therefore can do anything he wants. <br /> <br /> Despite an interesting hypothesis, however, the story has become really silly since then through riots (violent!) between robots and humans. Somehow this does not seem true, as one other reviewer points out, all this is very clever. <br /> <br /> Animation stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (especially Osiris) work for the best. As for the second part of the Renaissance, I say it is very violent and very silly. 10/04.
