Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (once played by Priscilla Alden) was released from a mental institution (though she killed six people) and was handed over to Hope Bartholomew's house halfway. Once there, she immediately returns to her insane criminal ways and kills everyone who gets her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! Do you suck this movie! You know you're in trouble when open credits start and they just balances from the first movie, apparently filmed from the TV screen. Nick Millard (nicknames Nick Phillips) decided to return to the Crazy Fat Ether world after more than a decade with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank bar and a video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique technique does not translate well into video. Seriously, I've made home movies with more production value than this. Millard tries to pull SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by stuffing half-runtime with footage from the first film (which appears to have been removed from the worn VHS version). Alden is good again like Ethel but the film is so incompetent that she begins to feel sorry for her starring in this trash. I mean, at least try the first movie. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if possible), a shaky camera action, and a terrible sound and editing it seems to have been with two compact VCRs. Avoid this at all costs!
