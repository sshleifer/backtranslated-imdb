It's possible that someone will make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictitious version only succeeds in draining anything real and interesting from the phenomenon of trash TV. There are dozens of famous bad films (such as "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show creativity and spirit more than this pitiful, ruthless waste of the film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why is there no documentary film about Jerry Springer Gallery, that would begin to answer some real questions such as: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear in this show? How did the Mayor of Cincinnati find himself here? <br /> <br /> One good line: During a "steering" session for guests: "People, I can not emphasize this enough: no weapons!"
