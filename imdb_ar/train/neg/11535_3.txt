Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, paid and highly professional woman who picks up the working class Oke Danny Dyer for an enjoyable night. After a stupid incident in the countryside, they are subjected to a brutal attack. After the recovery, having a chance to meet with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to the idea of ​​revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought the "Straightheads" were awful. Violent, brutal, hateful and unpleasant. If I do not like the phrase very much, I will call "Straightheads" a bad video clip. It was certainly this type of film that would have been issued without a direct budget during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I do not know how Straightheads got a film version. <br /> <br /> I'm not proud. I do not mind having sex and violence in movies, but they should get married to a movie with a) good plot or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" did not. Do not make in the plot or characters and a lot of left unexplained and unpaid. Luckily "Stra Straeads" went quickly anywhere. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because there was an interesting film germ here, with a particularly interesting twist in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it would have been good if it was done properly. what a shame. I really liked Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were hiding nothing with this movie. Are, in particular, very low (and are still particularly appropriate). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good British revenge film, you should rent or buy Dead Man's Shoes for the Meadows. It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend, I would have seen "this England" instead. Ce sera sera ...
