I wanted to love this movie. How do not like it? Carrie Grant, Jane Mansfield, Stanley Donin; all icons in their own way. However, the wreckage of the train that was Susie Parker ruined the whole experience for me. Her representation was so awful that I sat there with my jaw hanging, incredible my eyes or ears. I could barely make it through one show, how horrifying it was. <br /> <br /> Carrie? Wonderful and in a good dramatic shape. Gene? Adorable, granular, obviously a ball. The cast is quite good, and the city of San Francisco was captured with all its stunning and retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to speak her lines with coarseness, death, and ignorance that simply defies faith. Who said this creature can act ?? O VEY, people.
