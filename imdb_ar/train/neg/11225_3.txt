This documentary is a re-representation of the last few years of the life of Pete Beige (Richards). Tennessee tease was the most famous pin queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the fifties of the last century, and pagan images were bondage and anti-cats "Grily clicks." Irving Klaw (Doky Flaswater) in his "News of the Stars" directed a message to my home about what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous pictures or "Elk movies," but Klaw was accused of distributing obscene material and ordered to destroy it to avoid prosecution. Not surprisingly, my next cult at the height of her career. The charming girl with jet black hair and blue eyes and a bottle of watch that wears fetish clothes or does not dazzle for decades. After all, she was said to have taken pictures of Marilyn Monroe and a second after the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page will disappear and devote its last years to religion. In fact this movie could have been much better; but good enough to hold attention. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is amazing in itself. Bra, panties, belt and lace hose do not hurt her image at least. Also in the team: Jimmy Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simon. Please be aware that this film can change the heart rate.
