In The Van Rupert De Niro plays Jill Reynard. Or is Travis Beckel? Or Robert Bobkin? Or Max Cady? You see that the problem with this kind of role is that De Niro has played very similar characters in the TAXI DRIVER, King of ComedY and CAPE FEAR. Unfortunately, characters have been developed better and have better texts. I found it somewhat difficult to believe that Reynard could have started as a frustrated sports fan to become a psychologist and an outsider. <br /> <br /> The character arc is not the only problem in this script - it also lacks focus on personality I had a problem with the thinkers where De Niro was supposed to be great but it ended up to some extent), for several periods of the film I kept thinking that Bobby Riebern was the main character and then the story returns to Rennard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who think this should have focused a little more on baseball. I'm not sure if the goal is to attract baseball fans in the original, but again, there are elements that suggest that producers may have decided what to focus on. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I enjoyed the entertainment By the soundtrack), but it is a very flawed film and we must remember that by the mid-nineties the characters were being stalked by squares like SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY and others have run out of steam for a long time
