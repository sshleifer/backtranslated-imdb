Author / Director Peter Greenaway is named as Lord of Art House gift with his latest self-indulgence training, 8 women. The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son in their quest for sexual satisfaction, attracting women and picking them up (guessing their numbers) to join their own group of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of any possible way that this hypothesis may be offensive, and the chances are that Granaway will do so. Female characters are little more than a catalog of idols to share the two sides. There is Mobi the Nightmare Maniac, Giaconda and Perel Permanent Pregnant, who has something for farm animals. Julieta has no legs and is used as a wheelchair, she is "half woman" get it? Greenway strongly denies all accusations of dislike, but if not, then what? <br /> <br /> The film continues to provoke anything and everything related to Japan, continuing the themes of the 1996 film The Pillow Book (but less discriminating against sexual discrimination). But where the pad was exciting and graceful, 8 "women become horns and exploiters." Greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in his idol, and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the author himself.
