Although this film is a jungle adventure film in general, it contains some highlights - the settings are very beautiful, the pace of adventure is good. You will not be bored to see it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as relieved as possible to play a named shot, an unceremoniously drunk jungle guide to accompany the rich boy Van Hoffman and his wonderful shower wife on a hunting expedition in a cannibal country. He does not take things seriously. Bathing there as a costume and Keith take advantage of it on a large scale - she does not really have to do much. She is not the only female to boast of her body and the fine aspects of the film make him halfway to the image of T / A. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film draws attention to it, or away from it. Produced to be a lock, it succeeds without much fuss. Good 2 AM cable programmer.
