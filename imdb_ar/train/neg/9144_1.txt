This movie is really cool, and the candy Ben plays can make up for everything else wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> The writer / director / producer / lead actor etc. may well be the idea of ​​creating a film dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes, and any other issue affecting a man like me Sex at these times, but trying to turn every case into a bad design film little justice for any of these reasons. <br /> <br /> The text is bad, and represents a very ordinary boy, but dialogue and representation is sad. The sibling who hates gay is played by most actors in the camp and there is no chemistry at all among the major actors (I think I've seen more passion in the ad corn chips). Representation is strict, and dialogue is forced (the scene in which the brother was feeding on the detective was distinctive lines). <br /> <br /> I'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck was not paying any other waste for distribution and if he was thinking about doing so, I have some advice - just do not do it.
