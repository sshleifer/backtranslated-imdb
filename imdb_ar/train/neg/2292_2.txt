First of all, I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best Batman series by far. We saw it when it was on TV. I did not realize there was a four season. In fact there was not. BTAS ends with season 3, and should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why they had to mess with something good. Catwoman and Ivy poisons now have awesome gray faces. "Joker" seems to be far from the horror, and every time they look at it, his looks seem clearer. He seems to have no pupils anymore, and now he does not seem remotely human (though he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne's voice was voiced by Kevin Conroy, who is doing the best Batman man. Although it now looks like Superman. There is nothing that distinguishes him since both seem similar, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a hair story, please! Alfred has just had pupils with eyes, who seems more like a figure from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I've seen three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and I already find this version more violent and graphic (there is blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: the cartoon series, there's no Batman season 4. They've just listed this series in the fourth season of marketing. If they have just launched it as Batman's new adventures, I do not think many people have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3.
