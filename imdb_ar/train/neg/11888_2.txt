To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there must be some truth and reality. 1. Never tell us why these people think so. 2. The location is New Year's Eve in Toronto Canada. Please, some of the tell me why did not shine in the middle of the night and why (based on fashion), it looked like September <br /> <br /> 3. The representation in this new style was normal, who needs a director who knows how to do it . <br /> <br /> 4. The pieces of the individual story were all gloomy and without any purpose. I can go on, but I do not want to make it as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating * 1/2 (of 4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> <br /> Thank you as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (also known as) SIRBOSSMAN
