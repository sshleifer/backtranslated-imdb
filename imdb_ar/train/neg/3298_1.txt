When I heard that Dukes Hazard would reappear with the current actors and a hard line, I was like, "Well, I'll give her a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great show in the late 1970s and 1980s that was classic, mainly Hollywood insulted. It is very sad to see that the Hollywood script writers can not come up with something authentic these days. They seem to be taking a great show with a large target audience and trying to "remake" the classic show. Hollywood presides ... does not work! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have chosen a better actor than Shawn William Scott (Stiffler of American Pie) to play Bo. I am sure that John Schneider is certainly disappointed with how his character is portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, get real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. To what level can you go down ?? Actor crazy craass to play LOVED LOVED. This sickens me. Also, I will give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting absorbs. Catherine Bach, who played the role of the original daisy, was smart, exciting, strong and opinionated and a good southern girl. Every little role was for young girls! (I own the doll and pocket - thank you very much !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played the smart ass, a 2-bit slut like Daisy Duke. Daisy was not blonde. Why should they cast it. Jessica Alba was going to play Daisy Duke. She can speak in a great southern accent, she is wonderful, and she would do a great job. Anyway, I would say that this film blew something violent. I feel like I was blown up by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they have to recover my money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (the original series), do not see this movie. It will only bother you. CMT (Country Music Television) plays a replay of the Dukes all the time later in the night. So, place your TIVO and go with the real thing, not imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
