Let me be really clear about this film. I did not watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for the vile sex scenes. However, this film is so wonderful, God's curse is awful, I rejoiced between the pure joy of seeing the divine body of Tracy (Mandy Schaffer) and skipping my mazes out of a conspiracy disaster. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the film has really bothered me. You see a woman drawing something on the banks of the lake, in pure and quiet bliss, then approaching a pretty girl and asking if she can paint next to her. When they both finished, they showed each other what they had done ... The woman painted the vineyards when facing the face of the lake. What kind of ball screw manager would make that kind of mistake? In another scene, Tracy was killed by her teacher's lover by crushing him with a pole, then swimming away, and not once suspected by the city's police. I mean, hey? Mandy did not wear Did you do? Print her fingers around the boat damn God! After that, it gets worse, when Mandy is present, there is a "chilling" sound effect that is turned on and that looks like a cat in an appropriate situation. It is really unfortunate that Rosanna Arquette's is present in this film. I really feel sorry for her to have a star in this low budget super soft do not think. The same is true of JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has a star misfortune in this film. All in all, 2/10.
