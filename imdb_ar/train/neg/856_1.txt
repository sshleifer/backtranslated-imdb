They write about the end of the plot, so do not read it if you do not see it. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the horror section that made me think it would be horrifying. If I own a video store, I'll put it in the BORING section. This film is very nonsense and will make you feel like you lost your guard. <br /> <br /> This movie contains countless footage of people driving as if it were scary. Well, I do work and return (sometimes to the store or to visit my cat) almost every day and I trust it is not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of driving some people. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round goes and it never stops. What is the most frightening thing when watching a toddler riding a bicycle for an hour? I do not think anything, and if you see it you will not think about it either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car reaches a large castle and is given a tour that they only walk around looking for kitchens. Then the man walks for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all going on and as you can see it's nonsense.
