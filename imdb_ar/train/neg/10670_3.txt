Flat personalities that you do not care about and will never care about. The exciting dialogue in places. There are no deviations (they think they have one, but if you do not know it after about 40 minutes you are not very bright). Many actors are well known for their roles and performances which, fortunately to all concerned, will be forgotten once the final credits are finished. <br /> <br /> I do not mind "slow" movies, but they got it to go _somewhere_. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> It was not the plot that made this movie direct to the DVD, it's just a good excuse to try to provoke some fake differences. <br /> There must be 37 (!) out of ten (10) assessments as of the writing of this report by the persons involved in the production.
