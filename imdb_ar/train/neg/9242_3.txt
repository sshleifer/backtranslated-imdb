What a wonderful introduction: a film about the Berlin air bridge. It must be all. Tragedy. suspense. Compassionate. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and American pilots. Love and tears. What we have, is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so, but he fails miserably. Acting in a wooden manner, so that at any moment must be cracked. Trying to play the strong man, instead of being a strong man! Why does Bettina Zimmerman fall in love with him? Were they throwing stones at the lake? Does it bring coal bricks? The SFX is very good. Much though. Hundreds or more planes over Berlin, look like a squadron formation of a fighter rather than a regulated air bridge? As it was in fact. Interestingly, the Office of the White House, the Kremlin and General Lucius de Clay look like one set, dark and dusty. Notice the same curtains, hanging in the depths of windows, as if shielding shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene dark and obscene? By the way, General Lucie de Clay, it happens that it is a simple, unsafe, loser general, who trusts in his noble idea air bridge. The opposite was a lot. So, you combine all these individual errors and the result is a film made without any passion or suspense or historical accuracy. Sad, I started very promising?
