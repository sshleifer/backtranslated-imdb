At first glance, this gives the impression that it will act as a funny, funny flick, and it contains moments in which it turns in that direction. However, the idea of ​​the basic story is much stronger than would be expected, a respectable effort to portray ethnic issues in the Army of the Second World War. The team of distinguished representatives has been very successful, with Glen Turman and Richard Pryor performing better than Billy De Williams. However, Steven Boyd stops circling his thick shovel at a great bend for the star. <br /> <br /> The low budget clearly leads to inconsistencies in production values. The sites are superb, the effects and traffic are weak. Imagine if the "Rescue of the Soldier Ryan" was composed of half of the squad who were killed in the same way as Vin Diesel in Cabarzo (except we see the fire because they can not handle it), then led Hanks, Damon and Burns in a jeep and shot five Germans at their peak . However, the obligation, with no hero soldiers receiving any respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Captain Boyd's racially executed by this, is convincing as well as the sequence of Tyman's personal writing in the magazine exploits it if soldiers are allowed to fight rather than dig toilets. <br /> <br /> In short, "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" did not work. But it is a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It can be again as a very good movie, which is actually an interesting effort.
