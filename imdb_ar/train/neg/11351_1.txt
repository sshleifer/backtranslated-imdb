With this huge ad happening on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Like this, my son was urging us to see him. Between DVD's and theaters, I've seen pretty much everything from the outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, no kids or no kids. It was "when this stupid thing ends?" Type of experience? Well, it's directed at young children (or better - it's an insult to the intelligence of anyone over 3 years old), but I have not seen anything predictable, repeated, and slow moving. Then, as soon as you are finally immersed, you are relieved that the film is over. There is something strange in the end that you think is the preparation for a joke, but there is not one thing - it is dangerous, although it is hard to say that they are trying to achieve it. 3D Effects ... Yes, if you have not seen Viewmaster before, they are great, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it will be the same process). So my son was finally bored. My wife and I looked at each other and we said "Wow" in the end. Bad in all respect.
