Johnny Wismuller Tarzan's latest films are also good, as he is among the worst of 12 films he has performed in 16 years. Mermaids do not appear here as a beautiful island woman trying to escape from the clutches of her people, who worship God and try to force her to be her bride. I found Tarzan and Jane, both trying to protect her. George Zuko exists as a deceptive chief priest but is not used to his full interest. Also at hand is worth mentioning is a very annoying guitar player / singer who goes to the song often. Even the "big" Robert Flory can not help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
