The problem with this type of film is that dozens of them make every year. Fortunately, only a handful is used for a theatrical version, while others are pushed directly to the video or TV, such a movie. <br /> <br /> The first problem of this film is in fact its originality. It's one of those movies that uses the "Die Hard" version of a strong but troubled person in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, there is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works in a security agency that thoroughly tests the safety procedures of businesses and individuals. In this case, it is sent to a cruise ship, which is hijacked of course. You can see this movie as a combination of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One", and even the film does not try to hide that these two films were perhaps the biggest source of "inspiration". Really, you can not consider this movie as an original movie at all. All cliches are used outside the book and this film does not offer any surprises or anything remotely resembling anything original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this, it has very weak script. Or rather, he said, it was very lazy writing. As I said before, the film does not show anything original, but the actual story itself contains some elements out of the question and it is just honest irony. I mean, hijacking a huge cruise ship with only about 8 men, half of them only carrying some small arms and then asking for a ransom of only $ 10 million, for a ship worth about 10 times that amount is already very ridiculous. How do they intend to split these funds after that? Everyone gets just over a million or something? This is hardly profitable for such a big and risky job. Then there is the issue of taking passengers hostage. They somehow managed to take all the passengers on board the huge ship hostage and were able to place them in one room, with only one man with his gun, which he did not seem to be able to hold properly and watch. Never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all on board at that time. Also when Van Dien looks for his son and vice versa, no matter where they walk on the huge cruise ship, they always collide with each other immediately. Only some examples of slow writing inside the film. <br /> <br /> But of course it flicks away from work, so the story becomes of course minor. But again, it's not as if this film has any good work at all. Half of the actors seem to have never had a weapon before, and the film is full of irony with slow motion. It becomes laughable at some points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film also does not feature the best actors, although I must say that Casper Van Dien is not really a "hero of motion" and actor, as far as genre and film department b are concerned. Yet he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise. Whatever his age, he does not seem convincing enough to play with a teenage father. Van Dien once began as a promising young actor but starring in films like this does not help his career much. He may be able to do something better, although he has not really been given the opportunity to show it. All other actors are also doing well enough, but their characters are just a formula that never makes them interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the worst movie of its kind that I've ever seen but it's also exactly the most original or memorable either. <br /> <br /> 4/10
