Do not see this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective view, my friends and I estimated that we all lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person who participated in his manufacture and was not clinically insane was the fashion designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realized now that instead of feeling disgusted, this film generated deep hatred within me. I hate this movie very much. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this film is not meant to be taken seriously. Unless you do not take themselves seriously. But he does. The plot is a warm version of the Blade Runner-esque world, combined with cheap rubber suits prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only childish and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not try, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex sounds like fingernails on the soul. Whether it be with Joliet Landau, accompanied by a British accent or Richard Round Tree (also known as Shaft) as a clumsy commissioner, she will sink into a growing sense of uncertainty and frustration. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only to anyone who wants to see the depths of stupidity that may fall to mankind.
