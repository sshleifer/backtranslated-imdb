Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this proyect can be done. It is by far the worst Elvis movie linked of all time, it is completely wrong and ridiculous and a lot of mistakes about The King. Come on, the tomb of Elvis in a public park? Male for suspicious minds in 1958? ... These are just two examples. Some people in the team try their best, Mike Starr funny (especially as a parody), and Tom Hanks looks like a surprise, but the guy playing Elvis gets sucked. The film generally lacks the fun and becomes more boring after a minute. If you want to see a small and very cheap, but very funny movie about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
