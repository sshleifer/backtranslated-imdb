If the only gender I've ever practiced is a farm animal, the tagline for this film may still be misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most boring movies I've seen a pleasure to try and watch lately. I found a DVD in my friend's house, and I mourned not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can not tell me any details without spoiling the film because there are about 5 details just for this film. Just try to imagine someone making a film about things on c-span, just a fantasy film less exciting than ten times of boring talk on c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this film, but I could not determine exactly what it was after I took out my cast and threw it at Richard Gear.
