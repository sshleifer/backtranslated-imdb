This game has the honor of dis being the first game in which I stopped playing properly in the middle of it and I felt that I was bumping into holes and then burning. Congratulations. The first and last Tomb Raider, I will play at all and assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: Just typing this word made me laugh. There is no one. There is no personal development. Finally, we have a heroine who can take care of herself, not a sage *, but unfortunately she wears clothes like a slut and her breasts are huge. They had to attract the sex boy you see. In any case, all you do is go to the grave after shooting the grave while walking. Why do this I have no idea. I had subtitles on TV as loud as I could and did not understand anything. The evolution (or lack of) her, her friends and bad guys * was funny. There will also be levels you must pass by, not giving you any hint as to what you should do after that, and will literally be in the most boring tombs, while trying HOURS tombs to discover the hours of hell. Supposed to do. There is one course (out of two) in particular with them on a motorcycle (believe me it is not fun at all) that will be on ATLEASE watch with no point keeping in sight. This means you have been beaten by other motorists and men in trucks firing at you or pressing a tree to start a long journey around the clock. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know that this makes the levels very high for a long time, does not contain points of preservation, has no story, no evolution of personality, no variation in play, and enjoy most of the music on The longest levels of ear bleeding, and give no hints at all so that the player to stay longer in place instead of access to the plot does not exist. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: They seem to be thinking about ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs to develop personal character or plot or play without limits. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry sir, but these ideas seem to be going to kill the player too. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd. You are steady. <br /> <br /> Game play: All you do is shoot. Of course she can flip during shooting, jump during shooting, or kick again. But flipping, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that all you do in the end is shoot. boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The music provided is very beautiful. I love listening to it. The music in the game turns from endurance to wanting to cut off your ears. <br /> <br /> Visuals: Given that this game was made in 2006, I was expecting that the visual images would blow me away. Not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game is a mess in the development of the game without any personality, with little girls who do not wear formal clothes (thanks) in the front pass through the boring tombs of some of them a boring reason (which I may not tell you ) Using an unimaginable shooting game. Stay away from this B.Sc. !!!!!!!! He gets two stars because there is a woman who is not a girl in distress (no matter how wearily she is) and beautiful in music.
