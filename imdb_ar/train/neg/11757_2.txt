Hey Arnold! Is a slow and boring little film. The plot is not very creative. Paul Sorvino (Shenk) purchases all low-cost, worn-out buildings to build a large shopping mall, shopping complex and office buildings. The plot goes back to many children's films in the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorfino is not very exciting, so the idea of ​​being a bad guy is not too scary. Gramps recalls something about a historical document, and the rest of the film lasts about 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with Helga's secret help that her father hopes to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children around the city have to move around using buses, so the exciting scene of a bus ride is not just ridiculous, but it emphasizes how to write this film for very young children. O Arnold, TV animations are usually very amusing, and they have enough humor to attract adults. TV animations are usually the fastest and most creative pace of this film. Oh Arnold movie, five times more than a narcotic, a good way to put anyone, including children to sleep. Arnold was hard to stay awake all the way until the end was predictable and completely boring. If you want to send your children to a movie that is not completely offensive, that's the truth. I felt that instead of trying to produce a 90-minute film, the producers started to write a 30-minute television graphic and tried to expand it to 90 minutes. This mall story is certainly covered by television animation. We hope Arnold will bet that he is a better writer if there is a complement.
