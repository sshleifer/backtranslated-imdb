This is the worst film I have ever seen. That's what he says a lot, taking into account some of the choices made in renting movies. <br /> <br /> I've got this on netflix based on the fact that someone I went to in high school is nude in them. . The naked scene lasted for about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as pungee sticks driven under fingernails while forced to listen to Roseanne sings Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "They are stupid and they are the worst types of humor in the banquet hall and festivals in the dressing room. It is grossly abusive (and poor) from KFC that will beg Big Jim Slade to break the wall and save us from Stupid "Vince Show" (whatever it is). <br /> <br /> Unless you are masochistic, avoid this pile of rubbish.
