Any movie with an ironic title like "The Bagman" should attract the attention of any bad movie fan automatically, but the plot is much different than what one might expect after a DVD cover. Bagman is not a good film in any way. It falls within the category of films that appear to be (and perhaps were filmed) on a home video camera. The representation is appalling. I have not heard and seen such a wooden representation since Troll 2. There are lots of scenes with nudity and sex, but obviously they jumped very quickly. The characters are completely moronic and forgetful. The end (which will not spoil) can be easily predicted after watching the first scene. Because of the alien nature of the film, there is nothing far from the horrendous production values, which is truly frightening (terrible attempts at realistic revolution, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended for bad movie buffs only.
