One of those films is "Age of Mature" that should be nostalgic for adults and a promise for children. This film has no. It is a weak excuse to leave the body of Sylvia Kristel in double with Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the film is either silly or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. Laugh with frustration because we are supposed to believe that a teenager will go alone with the burial of a dead woman in his front yard. She strongly hopes that a woman named Emmanuel needs a weak body. As the film continued, I began to imagine a mix of tutoring and Miss Little Missons that made Sylvia Kristel vengeful Jennifer Love Hewitt while Howard Heisman makes us feel nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at the stupidity of others, or to perform Ed Begley Jr. Or to wonder how Sylvia Kristel will look with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson. Stay away from the films that are staring at Sylvia Kristel, who is not Emmanuel.
