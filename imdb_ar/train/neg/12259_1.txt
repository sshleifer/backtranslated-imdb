A film about a group of filmmakers, who want to produce a documentary film about a new type of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of evil animals or monsters, I thought this might be my film ... not so !!! This should be more of a guideline for how not to do it! Have a lot of occasional humor and the evil monster is an incredible joke, in the final scene goes after the main characters * Rolling *, obviously the feet waving in the air! Sounds silly! Good to laugh though. If it's only about the lack of talent among the actors, the embarrassing stupid dialogues and the stupid stupid crocodiles, it would be worth laughing at least, but it gets worse: I think the people responsible for this film have noticed how weak it was, so even though the old idea of ​​" Selling sex "... All in all, I mean absolutely without any reason that one of the main actresses shows her breasts up to the beast. Somewhere from the beginning there is a kind of "making" meaningless. This is the last element that makes the film an absolute litter for me. It's unbelievable how people spend time already producing such a trash! If you're looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
