I hated this nonsense, every Friday as part of the tgif it was, and I enjoyed constantly a great time with stupid every week. If you want to see something funny, "No On Tell Tell" starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, is really fun, and explains why no one goes into a good movie career after making a terrible TV show. This offer makes me really sick, I hate these children, and bag saget needs to jump off the bridge to make this clown. I've seen things funner everywhere else but here. I have written 10 lines! See "The Complete Home" to see as little as humanity can offer in the way of arts and entertainment.
