How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... Too bad she's out of the role completely. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I do not believe it's too superficial and the characters are nothing more than cartoon. It was not easy to limit the presentation within two hours of about 600 pages of the book, but I was expecting more than just seeing old furniture pieces and tea cups. I used to sigh every time I saw a representative who did not exaggerate (several times).
