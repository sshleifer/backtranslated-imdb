I do not always offer one star ratings, but the computer will not allow me to make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening headlines tell us that we are already in deep water. Although this is a low-budget exploitation film, there are 17 products that are indebted. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, the abusive couple Kenneth comes to his family in a sophisticated gated community. Pig home. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), allowed his children to escape throughout the day. <br /> <br /> Okay. We are already in deep water. Ms Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh, these are her children or her grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. She leads Della to the mall, a long stretch that could have been cut. To come home with the idea of ​​male aggression rampant in the universe, she is leading football players in the past in full dress and playing in the rain on Christmas Eve. Certainly. To get a reward, you see a car with a slaughtered gazelle tied to it. <br /> <br /> However, we feel some real thrill in driving scenes. It's raining and the traffic is bad. First we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then Della later tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, and at one point turn completely to check the back seat stacked to the charger for the phone. <br /> <br /> Walk around the mall, you see an old college friend trying to buy things but her credit card is rejected. Her husband may be angry because he will lose, but this is too complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> Lots run by the most ridiculous bands in the history of the movies. One white boy (Lucas Haas watching his career as he walks in the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Spanish. Imagine that Up with People went to bad and you would have the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a weapon, they only give them a position. A police officer comes to investigate the melee and shoot him in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded as it is, people are everywhere and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della flees in her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit safe area, she drives to the construction site, killing all four bad boys one by one using the tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> The main spoiler is forward. <br /> <br /> She returned home. The car starts from the outside until it goes into heavy rain. He checks the children and goes downstairs, and when her husband asks very well what she got in the mall he shows him a gun and shoots him from close range. <br /> <br /> The experiment of the four sails was supposed to lead to the personal empowerment of a villa. Instead, we know that her children may spend Christmas in the nursery or in a group house, because the state will collect them while responding to the murder. The four sails can be classified as a justified murder in self-defense. Husband, different story. <br /> <br /> I am very happy because I saw this on the cable. If I see her in the theater (did you get any version?) I was angry. As it is, I'm sad to see talent like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas wasting their waste as such. <br /> <br /> Even so, there is something very good. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford did not get to write or direct another credit since passing this feces. There is justice in the world.
