This is by far the worst Rajnikanth movies ever made. The first part is held in place with a strong comedy of Gundemani, but it gets worse and makes no sense. Our hero also takes pits on the saints bearing the same name (Papa) through one lame lining and completely staggered. In the first half, Rajni spoke about his usual collection of elegance and elegance. In the second half, he became a saint after being taken by a beggar through a multidimensional gate to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous saints who dug earlier) gave him special powers without reason Clear (other than the vine). This is already starting to get interesting right now? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film revolves around the waste of its magical actions, powers and magic against politicians and black magic related. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh, the black magic did not work on our hero because he happened to have a bad param ... er ... Shakti chakra with him. The usual bad guys and bad guys are cliches, tired, and, in the end, not quite as important to a scheme that does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the flaws, it was only fun to kill time with Yale and Baba-related hardcore during public events. It's also fun to watch others curse about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed pieces for his film via cell phone. That is how important I consider it. <br /> <br /> Rajni enjoys great popularity in Japan and has included two people (one called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this film just for that sake. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is pathetic at all. The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after seeing it. This film may have been a promotional material for Rajni's politics entry but the film's own results would have eliminated any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> It's fun if you stop your mind.
