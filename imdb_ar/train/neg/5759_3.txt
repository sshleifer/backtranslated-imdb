This is the third parody of the scary movies and hope to be the last. This time a spoof is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for a strange reason. In my opinion, this film was meaningless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and this is not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this was just plain stupid. If jokes are made up of battered bodies and people constantly throw things at each other, this movie is right for you. In my opinion, if you stay smart enough at home and saved your money and please stop making this kind of movies, they get worse 3/10.
