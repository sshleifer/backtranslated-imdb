In this film, Joe Bisky criticizes basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> Being consistent, the rest of the text can not be believed equally. <br /> <br /> A funny man pesci, this movie saves from drowning in the absolute rear of the cellar, but the other roles were very bad. The father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which was not good. Instead of being a typical villain, he looked like an ungrammatical Android programmer to make money at any price. Then there is a symbolic piece that is set for pesci as a friend or something ... I do not remember ... that was forgetting. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has rated this movie over 5 or 6 is a paid member of one of the movie studios trying to raise the reputation of this flooded film, or at least one of those millions of media folks who can not cash efficiently (You know, people feel bad if they give anything less than 6). <br /> <br /> Stay away ... away. And shame on the central comedy, where I saw this film. They usually choose the best.
