At the end of Dragon Heat, all I could think of was why I was annoyed by sitting in everything. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is interesting and this - along with Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. But you were ever disappointed. The writer Daniel Lee can not hold a candle to the likes of John Wu, Ringo Lam and Kory Yuen. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the most popular films I have ever made. Lee ended up with his visual style - and I use it so incredibly - that it fills the film with unnecessary black and white footage, freezing frames, slow motion, fast motion, and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all this to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Motion scenes are not special and perform like a mobile music video more than anything else. There is nothing to be cared for by any of the characters - including two supposed snipers who are professional and who have not been able to reach the wide side of the hangar from inside! - who were then overwhelmed by some of the most joyful dialogues I have ever seen in one of these Hong Kong actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from initial setup, everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and feels the need to keep reminding us of the stories of returning characters in case we could not get them several times. This is a book and an awful cinematic industry and squandering the talents of Samo Hong, Michael Bean and Maggie Keu. To be frank, I press hard to remember that Behn was in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you are really in a mood for a representative from Hong Kong, you are better off sticking to some basic food items - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989), "Hard-Boiled" (1992), Ringo Lam's "City on Fire" (1987) - stolen by Quentin Tarantino for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) or "Point Blank" (1967), Full Edition (1992). Or, so check out Yuen "So Close" (2002), which is a very entertaining, but not worthless. There is always the great French police representative "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> True, most, if not all, a little more, but they were still exciting, exciting and even suspicious movies. They have personalities interested in them and thought-provoking sequences. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is just awesome. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad film, he made a boring film.
