* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I leaned back to be fair in this film. You know he starred Madonna. I knew it took a whole week in the theaters. I knew he got a lot of bad ratings. I did not expect a deep examination of class, culture and sex as we did in the original Italian version. The benefit of the doubt continued for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna Gorgon plays a rich and ambitious vacation with her husband close to his friends and polite friends (a bad brunette like Madonna, and some expressions appear really stupid). Adriano Giannini plays the role of the first shipmate whom Madonna likes to insult and treat like dirt in every scene he has. Why is this bitch his? Just because the plot requires it until later when stranded on an abandoned island on the Mediterranean Sea, the tables will be overturned and taught a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love even though there is nothing in common and mistreatment of each other for two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a silly, flat and superficial film from start to finish. Madonna offers typical wooden performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances horribly at Giannini's request, a fantastic scene with Madonna and lots of scenes where she slaps and throws her in the ass. Jay Ritchie editing "elegant" which is laughable here contains some of the worst dialogues I have heard in a major film several years ago. The end is happy and unreasonable. It's basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets with "Overboard" minus previous nudity and the latest humor. <br /> <br /> Madonna's ego may be so great that she insists on continuing to prove herself as the competent actress. Please give it up, Madge, for our sake as well as for you. This is not her worst film though. This distinction still belongs to the "Shanghai surprise." She did not make anything worse ... yet.
