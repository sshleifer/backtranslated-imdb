The fracture is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not slanted or filled with injustice. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this thriller of France and the writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiation scientist Gina McFae (Lena Headley) learns about a strange world because her life seems out of control. While attending her father's birthday party (Richard Jenkins), the guests were shocked when the mirror crashed on the ground for no apparent reason. Things really get weird when you see a woman spitting herself out as she drives a car on a London street in a car similar to her car. Jenna sneaks into her husband's apartment and finds a picture of her with her father. She moves away and participates in a collision. Then mysteriously, her boyfriend is not the same; to be exactly family and friends is not easy to trust her. Are we next to her? Is it in a parallel world? Her nightmares become more horrible ... Are they broken? <br /> <br /> Glory if you can distinguish this ... it will not be easy. Editing can not be more compact. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melville Popard, William Armstrong, Michel Duncan and Ulrich Thompson.
