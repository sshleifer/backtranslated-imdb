be cerfull! <br /> <br /> This is a crap that you will not tolerate with another folly because it is beneath it! Well, I took this thing away, let me say something more objective. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Ashes of Time" for a very long time I think was a new experience on the article based on Thomas Wuxia's highly acclaimed novel because of the emerging reputation of director Wong Kar-wai. Well, despite all of that, WKW did not succeed in adapting the novel to the screen according to many fans of wuxia networks; often just shots of falling water, sweating beads, working horse legs, and so on. I could not sit in most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Quickly forward after several years when I wanted to give Mr Films another shot after hearing a lot of praise, especially who he was. I am fascinated by his latest news, 2046. A friend told me to start with w / Chungking Express because it is his most easy film. that's wrong! I was just r. I was deceived in wasting my time and money on this piece of naughtiness. Some professional reviewers said he hoped for isolation and loneliness in a big modern city, Blah, Blah, Blah. Everything is fine if the director has a point of view and has something to say about why these things happen and tell them. But no, it only shows what it is. Faye Wong's representation is very typical of the Hong Kong style: Baha'a, and deer in the upper front eye expression, tried to be a kind of gentle representation and the girl; the rest of the cast was equally uninspiring. <br /> <br /> I think the word, Auteur, is a poetic term for a director trying something new and different, which is commendable, but not unheard of. The art of storytelling, represented by Mr. Wong, The last 17 years!
