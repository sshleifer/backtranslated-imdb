This movie was my go. Perhaps the title was the greatest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about the zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the United States and a group of survivors, the band together, planning to uproot the zombie. Dead wrong! It's about a psychologist who suffers from weakness to kill his female arrests and gets what happens to him when a group of zombie women come out of their graves for proper revenge. As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor the province concerned. From where do we start with the seriousness of this film disaster that has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> At first, zombie women resemble Victorian Secret models with a dark, pale complexion. What are the zombies but the carnivorous cannibals, reckless, that eat as a result of their basic primitive needs? These zombies, like street owners and terraced models, speak as if they were in a poor film Noir and do not act like zombies. Surely eating and killing are there, but where is the stupidity and terrible deformity? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a major spelling in this type of zombie, it makes fun of the genre and asks the following question: "Why zombie machines can not be precious precious killers?" I would say that this film will be considered a really bad film produced and made by the garage. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombies too much, it's an insult as scary as it is, not even.
