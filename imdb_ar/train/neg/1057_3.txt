I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, it was too long, too weak and too weak to draw my attention. When I realized that the entire film was just about an older person returning his dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could have been a tool to bring us to something deeper, something more obvious. <br /> <br /> So, do not buy a big drink or run into the rest room. My children did not enjoy it either. Okay.
