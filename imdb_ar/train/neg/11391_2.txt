When I first started watching this film, I was looking for some kind of nice metaphors, but it soon became clear to me that this movie was actually about people on a train. Interpersonal interactions such as those you can see on any day on the street and when there is sometimes a more interesting position, the dialogue becomes boring and boring. Not because I do not understand how this film tries to portray the way people interact, but they are very boring in this film. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships, it is best to actually get out and buy a train ticket and take a look at the people on the train with you. It's realistic but you will not go to a movie to watch a movie about you sitting there to watch the movie.
