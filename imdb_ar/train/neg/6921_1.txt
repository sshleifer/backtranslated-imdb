I went to a description of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was. It was a combination of all the cliches of horror / excitement, trying to comment on many things including sexual abuse of children, devil worship, secret police, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. The laundry was beautiful. The child and Christ were fine, but apart from them .... anyway. I am impressed by the effort (though somewhat unsuccessful) in trying to show the Christian people differently ... Although they did, the way in which the Bible was presented was somewhat stored. But again, it may be because he was talking to a little boy ... no. In fact, I've decided it's just bad. Music ... oh my God ... awesome ... toooo overpriced. Okay. I felt bad for the people who made this film in the premiere; it looked like a poor student project. I'll stop yelling about it and tell you the bottom line, go watch this movie if you want to lose an hour and fifty minutes of your life on nonsense. Here you are.
