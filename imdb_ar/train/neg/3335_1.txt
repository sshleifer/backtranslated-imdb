The story of the film is the worst of its kind, a positive sign that the five-minute myth does not produce a full-length film. Poor Caesar Caesar as an emperor in vain, designed to look very stupid, and difficult to see. As a malignant tailor, Robert Morse does an ounce of magic. His unhappy nephew (Jason Carter) "songs" is only appalling and slow with regard to the scheme. The trend is virtually nonexistent, and adds very little supporting characters. Anthony was as beautiful as the emperor's daughter, but her voice was clearly named for some reason, a common fate among many young players. The film crawls at the snail's pace. Hans Christian Andersen must have broken some of the cracks in his grave when this appeared. Can be said frankly, at least from the story of this film, it is not surprising that you go directly into oblivion video.
