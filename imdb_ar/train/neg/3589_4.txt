I was attracted to this film when I looked at the list of actors, but after seeing it, I must admit I was a bit disappointed. The main problem in this film is that the actors are unable to keep this film on their backs. why? Because of the bad script. Although Dillon, Lynn and Jones are trying hard to take this film on another level, there is no innovative novel and very normal direction. So for the fans of Matt Dillon, this is a wonderful film, just like the admirers of the beauty of Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always wonderful, but this is not his film; much less than his level. So, if you feel this wonderful game, watch it but do not expect anything great or unusual. The only thing you will remember about this denunciation is Diane Lin's scenes; the rest of it is very forgotten.
