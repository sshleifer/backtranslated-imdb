Jorge Herschel's fans should look elsewhere if they pick up the film for his usual buckets, because there is little precious in the way of bloodshed in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell the strange story, relying on the special effects to bargain for a budget that could have been doubled if representatives turned into pockets one day. Strangely enough, while the bad behavior and the very bad behavior (especially by Maccabi Kamchil), the complete strangeness of the scheme keeps the attention all the time. Imagine how this movie could be with a decent budget! Overall, the strains of champagne tastes on a beer budget.
