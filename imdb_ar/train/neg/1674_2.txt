The premise was interesting, but unfortunately this film does not do justice to it. The casting process was very good, and it was beautifully filmed - but stylistically, much of the trend was inconsistent (the editing was too fast and it was done without any effect ... I was waiting for Stephen Boshko to work in credit followed by an announcement Commercial), the characters were identified exclusively through the use of coke on the screen (leaving everything else to Boogie Nights to develop characters), and there are no attractive characters to direct the viewer to the story. Very forgetting film.
