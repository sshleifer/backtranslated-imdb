I was required to watch the film for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I paid), but I still find that the film absorbs much more than average. The lame jokes were the main actors ... Well, to use the "first wives' section" for the ages of women in Hollywood, they were no longer "hot chick" but more in the "local lawyer" era. What angered me more than the film is the main line of the scheme, which has spread to a large extent "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(where all the boys are upset about some dude offering them money "to do his wife", not realizing they are expected to kill her). All in all, a nice piece of crap.
