Wimpy T-shirt Armand Louque (whose role was played by actor Dean Jagger in the role of rare rare) joins a group of researchers who wish to find and destroy the secret technique of zombie creation. Armand competes with the beautiful Claire Duval (who brings the blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the sap to get a colleague Armand Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland the desperate wooden) to marry her. Angry by his use and rejection of Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of Voodoo to avenge. Sound sexy? Well, definitely not. For starters, Victor Halperin's steady (non) tendency to calm the arrogant and quiet story in a slow pace. Even worse is that Halperin fails decisively to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the heinous arduous actions. Most of Blah's act of cast very lightly does not help anything; only George Cleveland as General Duval and Ellen Allen Warren as angry Dr Trevsant are able to enliven things with exciting historical novels to welcome. The class of vulgar film library, painfully obvious play sets, raw filmmaking is very poor and not impressive either. In fact, this feeble excuse for an awesome trait is so tender that even the eyes that do not stare honestly at the great Lugo Bella can not alleviate the boredom of the mind. And dud dull bitter.
