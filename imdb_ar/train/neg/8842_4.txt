It is fairly fair to say that most of the great reviews of the film on IMDb come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes, I have thought that the movie "Parasomnia". I've often been suspicious of suspiciously good reviews on IMDb because it turned out to be just as good as hidden marketing movies, but it seems somewhat transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it did not amount to being a good or great film that he had the ability to be. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, he has a great paddy in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a great job predicting threat and evil, I can easily see him and he has what it takes to play a truly memorable paddy on equal footing with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful pictures in the sequence of dreams, in fact if the film has decided to explore that terrain more, it might be better. The actual concept of hypnosis abuse is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that the suspension of kufr is necessary to indulge in any good story, it is a sign of a good story that has succeeded in allowing you to do so. If you find yourself upset about what you find illogical or silly, the story breaks you down and that's what happened to me in this film. The other reviewers mentioned this here and I do not want to enter the spoiler area, but I will say that the preparation in the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention the changing mental age of the personality that is supposed to have passed a few years of life. <br /> <br /> In general, there is a germ of great idea here in hypnotized hypnosis, but unfortunately this film fails to recognize anything special.
