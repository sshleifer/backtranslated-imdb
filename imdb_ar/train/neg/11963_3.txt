I love Billy Crystal, and I think it would be great watching this movie, because I know he likes Alan King and they'll be funny together. I thought I had seen all the Billy movies but I could not remember this, and now I know why. It is full of clich√©s and false emotion. You can smell every scene coming (and go!). Billy so do not be funny often. He is too busy trying to cry for false tears or to show his anger over how disappointed his father is. Alan King himself is somewhat liked, as with the sub-plot about being an extra in films. But what happens to Billy just to visit his father just like a major health crisis, etc.? Or that two busy doctors can only stop their practices for the moon in Los Angeles. When the end comes, boy, you come quickly! Almost as if the writers realized they had painted themselves in a corner and the only way out was to do the scene of death. Mostly disappointing with some glamor of good humor.
