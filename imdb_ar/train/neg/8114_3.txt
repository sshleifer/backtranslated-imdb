... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts awful material worth a minute FORTY directly obtained from the first Ju-on - and when you think that a sequel lasts for just 76 minutes, you leave 36 original minutes worth the movie. Is hum. I found this very disturbing - as if viewers would not remember the same things! - Not to mention dull, need to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Well, this complaint aside, the main line of Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain many unanswered questions from the first film, which frankly, over 36 minutes, simply Does not go far enough to give any kind of sense to the very complex original story. <br /> <br /> However, there are some wonderful new horror sequences that show how good the film is, if it has time to develop it; some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion - if you like the original movie first and want to see some other developments in the story, go for it - but just remember to make your remote control your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes.
