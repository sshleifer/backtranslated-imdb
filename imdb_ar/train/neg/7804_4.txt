THE TEMP (1993) did not do much of theatrical work, but it's the direct rupture of the video you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage firm that begins to get helpful hints from the wide-ranging secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelly). It turns out that Dider is an ambitious father girl who will not stop at anything about raising the corporate ladder, including hitting a big broker who can not stand up and kill anyone who stands by her side. She digs skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause trouble with her husband (Barry Bostwick), gets killed while making her appear responsible, abducts her daughter and tries to make her steal money from the company. <br /> <br /> Both Harris and Kelley offer efficient performances, the cast is fine and reasonably well prepared, but this does not fully compensate for the script that follows a famous track and offers few surprises.
