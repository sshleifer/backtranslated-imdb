Allow me to mention what is clear, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there is extremism in these two broad categories. Movies such as The Godfather, Save Private Ryan and Star Wars have comfortably landed in a good category. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those films that do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Sometimes, however, someone produces a really sad film. A film must be distinguished as evidence of the horror of the film. The movie is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship being hijacked by a band of vicious criminals who demand ransom from a similarly planned shipowner. Of course, there is a full American hero on board, complete with an engraved and engraved chest, which saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production of new depths. Everything is bad. Representation, direction, alleged plot, very poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate scenes. Even the American viewer will be annoyed by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to create a list of things that have angered me about this film. However, his most stupid conclusion should be a fitting example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are a wicked hijacker and that you are standing in an open lifeboat in a calm sea. . You are accompanied by a hero with a time bomb. Happy hero throws the bomb at you and dives into the sea. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I threw the bomb as far as I could at sea. Not this man. Watching as our hero swims away and then tries to disarm the bomb with an unfortunate result. He said enough. Such delinquency is worth mentioning at the Darwin Awards site and can also be an appropriate conclusion to the life of the production team.
