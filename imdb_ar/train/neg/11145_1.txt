where do I start ?! . . . I was violated! That's right, I violated! I've spent 1.5 hours of my life and 1.5 hours could have spent doing something more useful, like watching dry paint, on this so-called horror flick. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, no action, nothing ... <br /> <br /> predictable, boring, tragic ... < > <br /> I may be a little tough here, but I'm watching this movie and you'll feel the same way ... or ... no, do not see it ... unless you want to feel violated too.
