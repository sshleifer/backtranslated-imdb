Can only be described as awful. It's bad to start with and then get worse. When you start, you really have to follow it because it's impossible to believe it can get worse - but do not be afraid because it happens. Another script badly written for a donkey director for the children of former movie stars. It is difficult to determine whether the scenario is worse than representation or whether the guidance is worse than the two. As for the hero - it packs everyone including one scene where it outperforms the live daylight by making it harder by opening the wardrobe door and smashing it on the window. In another scene, it was thrown through a window and crashed at a height of 20 feet of concrete - so he did not blink - and then woke up immediately and attached to the bad guys. This is a really ridiculous film. Lucky it cost me only $ 1 for hire.
