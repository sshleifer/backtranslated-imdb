This was an excellent idea and the scenery was nice but this is where it ends. It looked like a dim array of "show" programs meeting the West. The plot hardly made any sense. There were a lot of characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were also unnecessary unnecessary things related to the plot and did not help increase the story. There were also long empty moments where it was possible to explore the plot but was used for silent or unnecessary conversations. The script should be more logical as well as directive. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But it was a great molding in my opinion. If you only watch eye candy, this is the right movie for you.
