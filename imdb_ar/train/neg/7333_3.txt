I enjoyed feeling the start of the few minutes, but 20 minutes at the time I applied the fast forward button. Lots of shots by Stewart (Michael Zellnicker) as he walks from room to room, corridors, doors and down the street, and many shots of him look tired and ragged. Gave me the impression that the story was originally intended to be short (20-30 minutes), then extended to an advantage as an act of love between the director Greve and the star Zelleneker (co-scriptwriter). <br /> <br /> It may have been more fun if any of the characters had anything I said I had not heard it in many other movies before, or if it was not the end - disappointing - the ones I had expected in the movie three minutes ( Anomalous for independent / smaller studio film). At least her heart was in the right place - it was not standard standard nonsense in Hollywood.
