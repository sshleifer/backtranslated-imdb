Wow, my first assessment of this film was so negative that it was not excluded. I'll try to tone this one down. Let's be real !!! No one wants to see the movie Chuck Norris where happiness was not the main character. There was a good fight scene in the end, but the rest of the movie stunned. I have to wonder if old Chuck can not hang with the best anymore. Has he slowed so much that he should turn into such an unwanted and hope to carry his reputation throughout the film? Chuck is a wonderful military artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine all of these qualities into his films, and these are not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, remain the main character in your movies, because this does not work for you ... Gary
