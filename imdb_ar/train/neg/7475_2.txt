To be honest, I knew what I was expecting before I saw this film, and I must say it has the worst representation I've ever seen. It has its moments, and at the level of comedy, it's very entertaining, but I'm afraid it is not scary, and the stupidity is transferred to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary injustice, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the foreigners were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of the whales (I mean who would go there anyway?) But I did not care at the time, because I was enjoying the fashion and the bad CGI. As far as B movies go, this title deserves "to be very bad, good" and a mantra to filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. These movies may continue .....
