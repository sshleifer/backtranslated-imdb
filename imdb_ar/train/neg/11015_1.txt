I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this film at Best Buy about a year ago, and I thought to myself, "It sounds funny, plus Michael Clark Duncan, how can I lose it!" I proceeded to pay $ 15.99 plus a tax for that. I took her to the house of friends and we stood grumbling about how bad she was writing and behaving. Many wooden offers. It seems that all the "fun" and "outstanding" promises she has made never come true. After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never recover it for 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I was literally crying too, because if that was what I thought of as "comedy," I no longer wanted to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed our friend of the horror of this film that he needed to see him to understand how bad his condition was. During the holiday season this year I saw him because he did not want to see him alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because when I saw I was just angry. I started to yell at the film, and I'm not talking to the film period. Everyone I know has made it clear that this film agreed to the worst we've ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often hurts my friends, but this can not save this movie even. The fact that this movie is not in the list 100 down on the IMDb is amazing. The fact that their classification (at the time of writing) is 3.6 crime against humanity.
