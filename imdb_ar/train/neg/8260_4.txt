First, I would like to point out that, although I am not an expert, the way in which the trial has been handled will degrade your intelligence. First, the prosecution has never proved that "facilitated learning" actually works. Is not responsible for both the prosecution (because they can get an appeal) and the defense for not taking action on this. As another commentator said, facilitated learning has proved to be untrue. Second, they used Terry as an interpreter with a personal interest, and even witness, in a stupid trial. If the court had allowed him to testify in this manner, he would have attended a neutral person or they would have requested an appeal. Third, this child never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution (tags, event details, etc.). Even when asked by specific defense questions such as when he started, he could not answer. If this is not reasonable, I do not know what it is, and the competent lawyer has obtained a patent. <br /> <br /> In sum, things start well with the pressures of being a child's parents with autism, but the experience makes this movie quite incredible.
