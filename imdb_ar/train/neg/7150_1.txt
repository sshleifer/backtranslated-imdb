After watching the reviews, I felt that this film would be a good improvement on this fast and furious series. So, I have already expected to have a story of palaces, but at least this time it will not be loaded with a bunch of helpless civic education and its crates. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you can only imagine a quick and angry film that has a storyline that is worse than it means that this movie suits you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm cute - no, I'm not taking a baseball bat for nuts as others have said). Not only is the story non-existent, but the work was very folly. I think the director thought they could throw a bunch of females and exotic cars and then call them a film. For example, there is a point in the film where the guy push the nos button and the Lamborghini jumps in the air and flies over the McLaren SLR to win. After Eddie Griffin got into a fight with one of his "daughters" (Emmaus will be suspended), the girl asks to pull out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of a desert. After this wonderful scene I could not bear it anymore. So, I just got to see half this monster. This is the first film I came out of. After that, I had to stop eating some drinks to kill all damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 because 0 is not an option. It is best for you to go to the local auto show and stop at a detailed barge on your way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
