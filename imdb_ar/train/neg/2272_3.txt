I'm not a regular viewer for Springer, but I'm watching his show in Profiles and I think this show is a guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. Of course, I will watch this film and I expect to see "Jerry Springer Uncontrolled". First of all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of movie playback time. I spent another twenty-two minutes building this phony masquerade around the trash, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Presley (who looks hot like HELLLL) is a whore in the trash can sleeping with her mother's husband (which is very uncommon, smokes in the chain, drunken Michael Dudkov who is finally moving away from his hero character in motion). The mother discovers this issue, she is fighting a battle, and wants to take her to a "Jerry" show (that's right, La Springer). Then we have a parallel story with a couple of African-Americans. They take it to the "Jerry" exhibition. The characters collide. Blah, Blah, Frakin Blah! Rarely was this trash BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why Springer contained millions of fans, yet none of them screened his film. Well, now is quite clear! Whether you love it or hate it, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a complete mess for a moving picture (if that's what you call it). It has been modified very badly, with scenes not connected, and after a while the plot actually disappears and simply on the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera turning into a comic farce. Rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive observation is a hot scene for the girl. This is as difficult as it gets. Make no mistake about it. It's up to the scene, but if you look at the whole film to compare it to the Springer program, it seems that this catastrophic farce is very sterile. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 3 (out of 10)
