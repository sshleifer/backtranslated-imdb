Although the film was fantastic, especially Diane Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it was impossible for any actor or director to make the film worth watching. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to go back. Perhaps we "hope" that the message will eventually appear and that we will be able to gather some sense of this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience may be able to "understand" this complex story, which is credited with the ingenuity of the human brain to understand absurdity. However, the authors did nothing to facilitate this innate need that we seem to have to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that those involved were simply passing through their own craft movements and that any essential passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, movies designed for television seem to be moving over the years. While delivering a message to the public may have been the primary concern of the book in the past, it seems that writers and current producers are giving in to their audience, with the primary focus on manipulating us "to adjust" through constant ads to be the sole cause of films such as Surrender, Dorothy is manufactured.
