The Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad film. The premise was good but overall implementation was terrible. I wished that the directors had taken their time in this project instead of rushing towards production. Some blind men get new eyes, and the bad thing is they belong to an old old wolf. Bad things start in the dude and he turns into a creature with a cheesy appearance. Can he find a cure before discovering his hot girlfriend? Who is this strange little dwarf who helps him out and what is the matter with that female policeman? If you really want to find out, check out Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> Not a bad idea about a movie. I wished the directors had spent a lot of time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the film.
