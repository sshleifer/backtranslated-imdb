In the first howling, we met a world where wolves were fairly organized. The plot in this film has a meaning. A TV reporter looks at this and tries to uncover the truth. She ended up killing many of them including her boyfriend who became one. Then show the world that they exist through the live conversion. The special effects were funny in the first film and did not improve in this film. Whether it is bad transformations or dolls or coworker graphics that show great powers. <br /> <br /> The land line is no longer bad; they must kill the wolf leader for some reason. This will not destroy all wolves and in fact does not end the threat of wolves because ... they just want to kill her. I think there is a cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film. <br /> <br /> After the movie ends, we have a precise 10-minute scale of the film we have just seen and every other scene is one scene where the female wolf leader is torn from her head to reveal her large breasts while some Devo-esquire plays in front of A crowd of wolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes watching this movie is watching Christopher Lee.
