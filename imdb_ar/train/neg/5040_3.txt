I read comments about this best Chinese film ever. Maybe if you do not have the only Chinese movies you've seen on any dialogue, long stars and long silences, and you've been free to edit, you're right away. <br /> <br /> A complicated story line? barely. Try events and amateurs. Great moods and haunting memories? barely. Try boring and smile. <br /> <br /> That was bad. I could not wait until it was over. Especially when the best lines in the film are "How are you? I'm fine, are you sure? Wonderful! What depth of character. I think that the constant smoking of cigarettes was supposed to speak on their behalf. <br /> <br /> As a great fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was very disappointed in this. So that Zhang was "emotional happiness" to Zhang better than this.
