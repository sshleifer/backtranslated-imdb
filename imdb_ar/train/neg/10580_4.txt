I saw this last week after taking a cheap DVD. I wanted to see it through the ages, finding a very interesting plot chart. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the main actor was very flat. This part of performance requires a show like Johny Depp's at The Ninth Gate (which is almost complete), but I think TV budgets do not always extend to this kind of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also think the trend was confused and pleasant, and I only remind me that Carpenter has not done a good movie since The Mouth of Madness. For the story - well, I was disappointed there! There was no way that could meet my expectations that I thought, but I thought the reward and explanation were bad, and the way he finally got to the anti-climate film, to say the least. <br /> <br /> This was written by a major contributor to the AICN, and you can say that he likes his cinema, but I was hoping for a better result than a good initial hypothesis. <br /> <br /> I took a DVD to the store the same day!
