I was lying on my bed, suffering from cold, flu or whatever. I think I might kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought me a short time ago. I wish I had not picked this movie! After seeing him, I felt more sick and wanted to get rid of him. After that (when it improved of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and noted that Dennis in the film was not like real reality. I hope no one will ever see this movie, but if they do not eat it or feel the way it felt after seeing it for the first time. I think you will have a better time watching the Santa Claus 3. At least, this movie has had better reviews on this site.
