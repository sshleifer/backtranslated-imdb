This film was slow but boring and often drifted into the land of pork. The Redgrave was not attractive because the 60 women who were trying to compete with Thurman were 20 things to love the character of Fox (Why Go Beyond Me). The title of the film should be "The Lonely People on the Lake." The actors played as if they were in rehearsal. The end is frighteningly predictable to take off. I can not believe this on this site as a comedy!
