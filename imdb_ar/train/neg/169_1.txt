I recently watched this movie because a friend brought it from New York City. After 30 minutes, I said to him, "You have to be kidding, is this a joke?" I think it was good. I told him I thought it was probably one of the most ridiculous films ever. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda film made for children?" The plot is stupid. Representation is the worst of all for most managers and people who are frankly looking at this kind of hate and believe it has anything to do with life, love or even the afterlife, which provides an incredibly stupid vision ... they need some mental illnesses to help. Please, if someone tries to stick to this on a DVD or video player, think of it as if you had entered a virus on your computer ... it will not destroy your operator but it will destroy your order. If they made Razzies in the 1940s, this would have won in each category. (Note: It also goes under the title "Stairway to Heaven".
