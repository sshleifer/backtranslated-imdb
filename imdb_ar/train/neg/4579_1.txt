"What does the Flip do not know !?" It was one of the worst times I've ever had in movies. It was less of a movie and more special after school, but at the same time nothing special at all. The attempt to tell the stories in which they founded their ideas was pathetic at all, and almost anyone would tell you. Marley Matlin in her underwear just should not happen. I will not dwell on that. What I will reveal is criticism that many can not formulate. This film, though boring, also suffered from a huge flaw in thinking. It was terribly contradictory because it took such manipulation, became a creator of your life, a manifestation of abundance, and a piece of senseless propaganda. Interconnection is interpreted as a large part of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our surroundings with our minds. He completely ignores the presence of other people with minds that can control us, and it seems so. Or at least the structures in which we are located have greatly challenged. In this way, the film was dreamy inappropriately. Do not mix comprehensiveness and interconnection unless you are God Almighty. If you are, you will be affected by (?!?) All the wonderful things this movie will reveal. If not, you'll be very disappointed, a moron, or maybe both. The title is also very silly. I find it difficult to warn people to watch the film because I feel it is wrong to mention it. Shame on all involved.
