I appeared in the movie Batman and TV lovers. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as great as some people had hoped it would be. I think it's a big disappointment. I think the problem was that it did not have a drama. Batman: The Fantasman Mask and Batman Beyond: Joker's Return has a lot of drama and Batman & Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this film is the light for Batman. The only scene that looks a bit dark is the big fight with Pan in the end. Anyway, it's a good Batman movie. But I just hired it.
