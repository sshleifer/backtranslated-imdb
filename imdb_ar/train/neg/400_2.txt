I rarely made these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain of watching this movie. It is stupid and unreasonable in the public story and in detail so you can not simply suspend the disbelief. The problem begins early, when you see a government researcher walking in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, DC, that kind of life on a government paycheck? Haha! It's getting worse. In the end, when the bad person begins to kill the bad guys, the last group acts so stupidly that you want to die, in order to clean the gene pool. The special effects are very good - no money can be bought by producers - the major actors were great in other films, but the script and guidance here are obscure. Many people wondered if there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Fierhoffen's previous stupid films (showings, stars of the vehicle), but this film should stop asking. It's just bad bad.
