I found it very difficult to watch this after the first five minutes of the film. I managed to stomach for 45-50 minutes before turning it off with disgust and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, was a great treat). <br /> <br /> The story contains huge holes. The plot line has ended dramatically and is finely funded, and the representation is awful, especially from Justin Timberlake who should stick to what is good in it (look at singing and singing like castrato). Morgan Freeman seemed incredibly uncomfortable, especially when rock music was performed for no apparent reason in the middle of the film after his encounter with Timberlake. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to have a sort of father-son relationship or something, which is simply not clear at all, regardless of the fact that, although Freeman's character seems to have only contempt for the timeless and timeless character of Timberlick Stupid, he did not say everything about any stops to help him reveal a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It will take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply ridiculous and rude in all respects. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
