First, I never considered myself "Uwe Boll Hater" because I think I never saw anyone in one of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (I'm about to join the club) The hatred. This film has no sense at all ... The joke plot Although Boll is clearly trying to draw attention by shocking people, the 90% of this film is just plain boredom. You can summarize this movie like this: <br /> <br /> 1. A masked killer watches clips of animals being tortured on TV. These real-life footage at Bilt Farm and opens the film for an ironic reason is "make a statement about humanity" and give the title a beta. Since this film contains no message at all, and represents the worst part of the pornographic exploitation of torture, you already have a reason to hate the film from now on. <br /> <br /> 2. Dielectricity under the pretext of giving what happens later in this film printed on the screen until there is every delay. <br /> <br /> 3. Police officers watch videos of animals, babies and women starving to death, grazing in the seed cellar, having stupid nightmares and weeping at whiskey because the seeds are very evil. Although acting is fine, only the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. The policemen bust the seed at his house, acting stupid and getting cut in the dark . This sequence reminds me of a video game, barely seeing anything except batteries. Seed is a super murderer everywhere and all the policemen act stupid enough to kill ... except the person who shocks him. <br /> <br /> 5. Master gets the chair and we see that the electric shock is as long as everything else in this "movie" ... will not die and we will be reminded of the opening statement that he should be released if he survived three electric shocks. He guessed what ... they buried him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seed gets out of his grave, kills everyone in another slant, then searches for the main policeman to avenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman hits her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for fun and shock value. <br /> <br /> 8. The master of the family of the police captures and tempts him to his home and threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After his wife is killed by a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself on the head, saying that what he wants is a master (it is hard to get into his head because he does not wear his mask only in prison but he never speaks a word. . <br /> <br /> 9. Boll goes to the horrible endless end where Seed locks her daughter with her deceased father to rot like the people we watched on video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is ... No message , No conspiracy, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background but a stupid story that a master has been burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This film relies on a few scenes and shock value. I hardly remember a blank film of any emotion, message or amusement. It's like watching August Underground ... that's good with me, some people will enjoy this ring without brains. But what is hard to stand up to is the false message at first and the fact that the film is well done because of camera work, effects, and even that representation is very good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get the money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work to create volatile budgets? "Seeds" are not just an ironic essence, they are living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky enough that the German taxpayer pays for so much of this waste to get a discount.
