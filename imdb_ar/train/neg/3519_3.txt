There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this film did not meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a group of terrorists who destroy the land in the wild are prepared to stay for at least two days. Also, in all this wilderness, Stallone & Co. continues to work across bridges and ladders that provide convenient shortcuts or drawing devices. Also, Treasury police do not seem to coordinate anything with local rescuers. Also, the bad guys who could not get to the side of the barn with truly high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I loved the villain for John Lithgow at first, but the character is so mentally ill that he does not do that, do not care about any of the bad guys or kill them all. In the end I could not believe my character anymore. <br /> <br /> I do not deserve the rent, and it does not even take time to watch.
