I rented this DVD after I saw it while looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and loved it. In fact, I admire the work of Yalom in general. (I am a clinical psychologist). I have probably watched 30 minutes of this movie and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can get more. On the superficial level, the fu accents, as others have commented, simply distracted at best and irritating and suffocating at worst. Acting is boring when you have to be emotionally and comedy when it's serious. The portrayal of Le Salome is simply simple, and the wonderful Freud comes more than just a pupil. I see very little of the spirit of the book being transmitted so far. I was hoping to be able to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will refer them to the book. imagine that.
