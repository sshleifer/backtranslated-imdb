I read the Thornton Wilder play last year in the eighth grade. I also had to sit through this weak translation on her screen. Let me tell you, it's not a great play, it's easily overcome, but the man deserves a much better shot. The representation was really lacking. The true scene of God, it seemed as if it was made of cardboard by a group of children of the age of three. As if it could not get worse, the sound quality is poor ... there is a "buzz" that astounds the mind when one of the actors speaks ... and I can not help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, does not exist. All the actors seem very uncomfortable for your presence there. There is no music in black and white, which is good, but it highlights the joy of cheese. Anyway, I think if you're going to refer to seeing this movie, which I do not really recommend, do not point your hopes up. The play, as it is strong, is probably the best.
