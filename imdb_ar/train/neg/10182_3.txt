Well, once you read the title, you might think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started good but it became very boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> She tells the story of a very desperate mother to make her daughter so encouraging that she goes too far to get what she wants. The only problem is that her girl friend is the girl in the way. She always wins contests, and thus drives the mother to "eliminate" them. After talking to a "professional killer," the mother decides that the girl needs to be a bit lighter. So actions are taken but they are finally caught. <br /> <br /> The cast is awful and the movie goes on for a long time without a thing happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
