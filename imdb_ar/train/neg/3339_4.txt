Barry, the medical copywriter, has an eroded mind from his job, coupled with abusive recollection memories by his mother's husband, Barry (the original Lézarez Génér Hansen). He snails into madness, and ultimately a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald mute man) battle to control his soul. This movie has been undone by some bad and unintended scenes. To say nothing terrible or anything, just tell him that he is known only as to the rabid fan base of Bruce Campbell (and I am one of them) who will see anything he shares or participates in one way or another. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Additions: Comment with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second Comment by Calliou and Sound Designer Joel Newport; "Hate Every Minute" 17 minutes documentary; Deleted and extended scenes; takes the alternative. outtakes, footage of the world premiere.
