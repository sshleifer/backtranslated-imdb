Through this presentation and budget, you expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of films that are on a bizarre border yet still work. Neither he nor his sister nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this trivial image of poorly written rubbish. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing more than a series of visual and poor gags in it. The plot does not go anywhere, writing contrived, meaningless thin figures papers. If you think that the 3D movie where the story and the characters add depth to the pictures, this stench appears flat like Mickey's steamer. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Ackroyd in this remake of other memories is a really terrible film, in 1991, nothing but the problem. Frankly this film is the kind of project that kills jobs and expels agents.
