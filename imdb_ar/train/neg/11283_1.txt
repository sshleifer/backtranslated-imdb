I felt that the Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the line was thin and confusing, and the players had some terrible dialogue and very dubious dialects. The work of the camera was somewhat experimental in some places, and although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it made it harder to see. One of the most disturbing aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of the novel throughout the film almost as the whole plot has been dictated to the audience. Best offers were not related to the representation. In fact, perhaps the most convincing performance comes from Danny Bear of all people, although it is recognized that he plays the role of a typical office secretary. Do not go under any circumstances to watch this movie unless you need a reason to catch some of the missing sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
