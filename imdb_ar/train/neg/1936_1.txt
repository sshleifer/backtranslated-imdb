Warning spoiler. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pressed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka beside her to show she was drinking wine. But before she was killed, her sister's business partner, Terry Garr, told the phone she had not had a drink for four days. However, the police never reported the results of the toxicology report! The characters talk about her drunkenness when she falls on the stairs. Hey? A really bad mistake in this film, which is very terrible, in general. <br /> <br /> Amazingly bad, taking into account the great cast. Some drawbacks: writing is not very good, music dedicated to television, there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the puzzle of the first scene in the film.
