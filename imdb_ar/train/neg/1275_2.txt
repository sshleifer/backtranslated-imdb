This is a terrible film. All three stories in parentheses with the hypnotist line of the psychiatrist is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. The first revolves around wild wolves and lady, there are some stale things, but the hypnotic thing makes up for it. The second, with Bill Paxton as a bad fellow in a maniacal room should not be seen by anyone. Another one, unfortunately the best is almost incomprehensible, I think it makes it better than other garbage.
