I see what the director was trying to do but he lost the mark. The main actor was really good but editing around his moments takes you from him. The work of the camera, ie lighting and exposer is a kind of amateur can forgive him if the trend is more fluent but it is not. The sound was a bit off and took you out of the movie too. I think this director works a bit better in the future, so you can not stop it completely but do not expect the DV movie to be good after about 28 days or anything, keep your expectations low and you'll get more. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yeah and other lead was very bad acting if you ask me. But I'm a hasty film so take it for what it's worth.
