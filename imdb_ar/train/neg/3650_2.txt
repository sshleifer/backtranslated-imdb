Do not laugh at all. Yes, I saw the wreckage of the entire train but just so I do not even wonder if Cleese had reached his senses in the last part. (No, he did not). <br /> <br /> It may be historically interesting for you, young people there, to see that British "humor" included such black "jokes" 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> What surprises me most is reading the comments of other reviewers, who admit that this is not good, but then turns around and gives high sounds. If the vast majority of comedies I've seen are much worse than this, I'm certainly sorry for your torture. <br /> <br /> The level of humor in this show seems to be aimed at young children, but the subject does not happen. So who is this? People who enjoy double and frequent things, skills, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip to 77), and other "low" humor. The three laughers are still funny, they were me and I too. They have made some effort in making jokes. However, the shlock is overturned. I fear that the end of civilization, if these things are really acceptable. Then you will tell me that tabloid TV is common. :(
