... and I actually gave it zero on my 1-10 scale. I have been in films since 1952 and watched more than 1,000 people in the theater (I do not make films that I see only on television). This is the only movie you've ever rated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (ages 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26 years old) who alerted me to this site (she was surprised that the film had a total rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animations of amateur dinosaurs at the time (and even worse in past events) seemed to be acting out (especially by Sean Young), and the story line was ridiculous. <br /> <br />
