Very scary film. Ameeteurish and not funny at all. The leading personality played by Mohammed Ali Erbil is very disturbing. Amendments made by E.T and Star Wars are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good idea in this film. He must master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find a representative with his qualities. Unlike Goksal, this film is a waste. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comedian and this film is his worst written work to date. <br /> <br /> Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sommer Tilmac also has some presence. The actor who plays the role of the three sons has no talent at all.
