Do not be wrong, this is not scary, not really a movie. I strongly recommend not to watch this failure for 82 minutes; the only reason why a star deserved it is Chris Pane's presence. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened. You wait patiently in the hope that there is a flicker of the glance, a hint of surprise, a conspiracy to appear - but no. <br /> <br /> The characters turn into irregular steps in their actions and do not give up enough time to evolve - thanks to the economical editors and the shamefully honest writers - before returning to a poetic and gay state (bringing the rocky montage). The only thing that could have made matters worse was the addition of the rotten, fast-paced "comrade." <br /> <br /> Their encounters with the obstacles (whether human or physical) are short, confusing and utterly futile. <br /> <br /> Chris Pine struggles to keep himself above the surface while drowning because of the misery of light weight. Lou Taylor Pucci can not be drier if he spends the summer with Keanu Reaves as he navigates the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> Watch "The Road", watch "28 Days Later" and watch TV all day ... anything but that's what I'm going to you. Tired of boredom, contrary to what may lead you to believe in the film, this film is not a cure.
