Well, let me begin by saying how far this movie is quite enjoyable, I could not simply stop myself from laughing at his utter stupidity. Do not be wrong, you've done well by Basinger, but the script is good, the mind is really puzzling. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and up to witness that Della actually murders the crime involved but then just goes down. In the middle of the film, the hero pulls out her toolbox. Instead of pressing the man's head, she decides to pull the screwdriver and the car jack and finally the glow (as in a shipwreck) to kill her victim. . <br /> <br /> Then there's the last line I've prepared, if you do not have stitches, I'll eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those who simply want to laugh at some horrible old movies. Perhaps I suggest you also watch the scene in the scrap yard where the man drops me from a wooden board high in his feet, every time.
