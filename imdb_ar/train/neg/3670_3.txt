In order for a good science fiction film to work, the film must be original or very good. This film is not. There is certainly a false original development in that men kill people because of poison and not because of illness, but this is a very simple development. There is the cornerstone of the government plot, the Crusader protagonist who has a personal experience ... <br /> <br /> A real flaw of this film is that the polluted man has no effect. Although the letter is written to be someone to pity, it is not. Without pity the film is useless. Other characters are cutting the cake so it's silly. Subplots are complex and annoying. The saddest thing is that the film is so flat that it can not be enjoyed as a fake material. Make it 45 minutes short and worth watching.
