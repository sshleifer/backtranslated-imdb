Chan Walk Park is nothing if not innovative. I'm Ciboure, but that's good, it's full of a little booming technical pleasure with some creative ideas spread out. In an attempt to follow in the footsteps of Mark Caro and Jeonette (The City of Missing Children, Delicatessen), Park begins a fictional fantasy that is a drastic departure from the usual sick fare. Hardly one is mistaken for his ambition or vision, so it is not really expected, therefore, to see all of Park's efforts added to very little. <br /> <br /> I'm a CYBORG but it seems to be an amazing proposition of himself as he walks, and the end result is a small part of the sum of his parts. The premise is promising, the gags abundant and mysterious humor but all failed miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are nice and quaint and played with gusto by the cast, but, try, as I do, I could not bring myself to pay attention to any of the people. <br /> <br /> The symptoms of LADY VENGEANCE were wrong, suggesting that Park may have been over-projection, but still able to show some of the director's unique lights. Following an impressive film, Tolerance easily. None of the confirmed confidence that the joint security area ordered or scarred Mr.. Revenge is clear here. I left my CYBORG, but that was good, left me completely untouched, and found myself advancing instinctively from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). LADY 5/10 was given, and by this procedure, probably not worth more than 3. For the old time, I will be Karma: 4/10
