The jungle is not just your normal cannibal fare / background, it also includes an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story revolves around two couples walking around in the woods on a camping trip. Soon they were terrorized by a cave dwelling, a woodcutter, the ghosts of his dead wife and two children. There is something that every slant does not see. Director Don Jones gets "A" for the effort Although the film itself is stable on almost every level, the acting is just average except for Janet Kelly who plays the role of a dead wife in the woods (Michael Prodi, also known as Gary Kent). <br /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple walking in a valley and in a forest. They realized too late that someone was chasing them. Both are sent in typical slant fare. Our killer uses a hunting knife secured throughout the entire film, except during the use of the flashback when he applies the hand saw, the Pitcuff, and the rusty saw blade to send his deceptive wife. <br /> <br /> The Forest has a good story line but the movie just does not work however I found it very boring with crappy acting simply. 10/04
