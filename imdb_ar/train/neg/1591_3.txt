After watching several "Next Action Star" movies, eps TiVo recorded this wonderful game. For a strange reason - I only have myself to blame - I watched everything, hoping there would be something * unique * in the entire film. After a lot of hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with excitement clicks, he may want to make sure he acquires alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, the only value for the entire movie's recovery was Billy Zannie, and he could not even lift the Chloe Slip writing from Crapper. Having said that, Zane's performance falters in about two-thirds of the way, because he does not seem to know what to do except appear to be a non-smoker. <br /> <br /> You can not blame him here. Writing, quite frankly, sucked. Let's take ideas from Rat Race, State Enemy, Terminator, Midnight and any bad movie you can think about and simply reformulate. And who had the idea to have two sequences to chase two bridges in ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, "The Action Man" of the "Action Action Star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the casting process mentioned by the directors throughout the series. Johnny Shawn, plays Sean with a gorgeous appearance and good-looking, but he struggles to bear the weight of the film. Quite frankly, we do not seem to care whether he lives or dies by about halfway, as Carrigan fails to present a reason for the audience to like. His old stupid routine has become old because there is really nothing about the personality to which he must reach. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan's dream compared to Corin Van Rick de Groot's wood. Did Howard Fine tell her to pretend she was active in the first half of the film? I do not think so. I kept expecting to quote show me. Her "performance" character can be compared only to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered", although it is almost undeveloped. The camera loves her in dark dark limousines, but in harsh daylight she absorbs all the energy from the screen. Jane Bauer offered a more natural life in her five-minute part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sean has a good rugged appearance to make a good team in a band, but should not be left to do it solo. It was simply a very big task for him. The next star movement may have had better luck with some of the more dynamic profiles, but it is hard to tell Jeff Welch's dangerous scenario. Someone must take the iMac Wals away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. Finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply bypassed and out of reach, even if so. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
