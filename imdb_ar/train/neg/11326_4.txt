This is one of the postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun in 1993 - this one is bad. It is clear that all his energy went to the film "Nemesis", which was a non-stop action movie, and his appearance was much more expensive. "Knights" is a clunky and cheesy, a science fiction from the bottom of a barrel often like a video game (new opponents appear all the time and must be exterminated as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undoubtedly a brutally effective fighting machine. For Chris Christoferson, taking into account his age at the time (58), I hope his weakness will be well-off. (* 1/2)
