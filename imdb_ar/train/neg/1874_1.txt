I have been one of the most vocal supporters of Hal Hartley ever since I saw his short "wish to survive" in high school, and until then I was still very satisfied with the wonderful Henry Bean. But this 10-year relay is not only necessary, but disgraceful. <br /> <br /> After a volatile and urgent start, "Fay Grim" moves into a false intellectual, explicit boredom, and finally gratuitous - and undesirable - nihilism. This is just a plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are as trivial and as poorly developed as the movie: one of the flat characters ends up in the half-time track we spend with the infamous Henry Bean, and it seems to be the only scene in the film! <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolfrich's agent for Geoff Goldblum is the only bright person (certainly the intended pun intended by Hartley as well). How, then, is he left? ** SPOILER ** Dead by a car bomb, making it easy to be the most violent film in Hartley so far, and all this error in a movie actually misses everything. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is she Grim?), let alone Fay herself ... Well, they will not spoil their fates, because the film does a good job well enough All this is special (when it is not occupied by another granular angle, which gives a disturbing impression that Hartley is moving back from Outeyer to a crappy film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, an awful mess is not so good of humor to reveal its clutter. Instead, she devotes herself to the fun-loving pretexts that her manager usually does in the "real world," which is far worse than necessary, but not ugly or mean enough to get close to owning anything she says. By doing this, Hartley tracks all the memories of these people and the wonderful world he originally invented for them. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been very depressed in movies, and I count "Leaving Las Vegas," which has developed at least new characters we love before they are destroyed, rather than ignoring the already beloved characters immediately. <br /> <br /> Already bleak.
