When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie as less than 250 movies, I thought it was very harsh but I did not know that the low rating was absolutely true. <br /> <br />. I loved their scary movie 2 and enjoyed the white chicks. But the little guy had a little laugh and jokes were old. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the joke revolves around Marlon and Ayans, who plays dwarf growers who were finally allowed to jail. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal the diamonds allocated to the gangs. Things are abhorrent, and the dwarf must put diamonds with an exciting couple of doubles played by Sean, Ian's and Kerry Washington. In order to restore diamonds, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned child left on the threshold of unsuspecting couples. Of course, the drama is received and the search for diamonds begins. <br /> <br /> The film features some actresses and actresses from Saturday Night Live such as Molly Shannon, Rob Schneider and In Living Color. However, not all of these talents can help in writing bad text and jokes that were not simply funny. <br /> <br /> The special effects of making Marlon Wayans to look like a dwarf were fine. I mean, it was not 100% acceptable but it was good ... nothing great. I hope the Wayans brothers have done more to develop a written text with good jokes instead of trying to support their weak texts through the actresses of their comedians and actresses. <br /> <br /> or TV. It really does not deserve any amount of money.
