I am fairly impressed with the work of Lynche, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I have been very let down. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a kind of annoying and disgusting humor. The animation is very raw, no doubt using Macromedia. Every cartoon by a big fat man beats his family and acts in general as a jerk for everyone who knows him. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this context of animation, they are likely to be somewhat impressed with it. However, if you have spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, these fees will not differ from any of the other things I've seen before. Many famous Newgrounds amateur artists perform much better than they did on this DVD. If Lynch sends this work to the website, it will merge perfectly with some of the best Newgrounds artists. But, since I saw it on a DVD, instead of viewing it on Newgrounds, I'm giving it 4/10, instead of 7/10, as I'd do it. This fee is suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expected better quality in the story and in the animation.
