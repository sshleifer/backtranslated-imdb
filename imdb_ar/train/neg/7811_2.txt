Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent to your sins. Then things must go on the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie is only played as a bad summary of the life of Drunken Kribi. His mother died. His father's wife is b_tch. The death of his father. He drinks. He gets married. He has children. Some drink more. His wife gets angry. He disappoints his children. Wife threatens to leave. He calls until the early night of reverence B / C wants to kill himself. Then after the feed is done, this is when we get "Left Behind" - like the hidden message. <br /> <br /> "He needed a salary." This is the phrase that I had to repeat over and over as soon as the credits started so I would not lose my respect for Madden. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls on his knees and forgives Christ. As soon as he does, he walks outside and actually says he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that he found God and this is good enough for her. Face scene four months and wife tired of going to church. Quit the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives homage to how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. the last moment? He gives a slightly reluctant wave to the tape (no house of sin) and gives gay, Miami Vice, after special congratulations after school in the air as camera freeze frames. See why I had to repeat this phrase? "He needed a salary." <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. Production values ​​B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could have been a "Touched By An Angel" episode. It could have been out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The representation is wooden and can never be believed. Even Madsen, whom I admire very much, and the only reason I'm sitting in this matter, explains that this is his first acting job and that he does not know $ $$ from his elbow so far on the camera. In the 45th minute I started to feel frustrated. This was something like homework. I just wanted to put it down and say it well, I saw half of it. That's good enough. but not. If I sat during the Ninjas encouraging, I could sit throughout this. <br /> <br /> The only reason not to give this one thing is two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it is not fair. But it is wonderful to see the opening title of "The Making of Michael Madsen." Judges. 2) Some dialogue is so bad that it is classic. I will stick to some quotations at the end of this so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> That's it. To wrap it up, this thing is a piece of crap you should keep chasing with the rest of the turds. But hey! a look! Michael Madsen! (See also Tilt, Executive Goal, My Boss daughter, etc.). Now I have to re-watch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen's torture as a cop to restore my respect for him. See ya, children. <br /> <br /> "These things will make me blind, but I will drink them anyway" - the first taste of Madsen for cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not do" I understand! Everything looks very nice! "- Madsen walks outside after confessing God <br /> <br />" I'm going to downtown later and pick up the Bible and I'll get a hair story too "- Madsen After the conversion to the dinner table, because the devil lives in your hair
