Surprisingly, the film has some quality to replace when moving towards its end. For the other part, this film is very bad and lame, with a small budget, and a poorly written and offensive text. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous that all the money is circulating in Christian circles that can never get enough money to make a decent film. I am not religious, so I did not really care but filmmaking is like a good tool to reach a new audience of churches and make people more interested and curious in reading the Bible for example. In this regard, these films always seem to be a lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurts the film and causes it. It makes the film laughable to see its effects, and it gives the entire film a very exciting idea like B. <br /> <br /> But what hurts the most is writing it. The things that just happen in this film are just an insult to intelligence and then do not complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film is made is very unlikely and people in this film do things so unlikely that it humiliates viewers. <br /> <br /> She also disliked how the film sometimes resembled a soap opera. It seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full movie and they added in some exciting characters and developments just to fill things out. I could not really pay attention sometimes. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that the film becomes more stable and firm at the end, when the story focuses on the essence. It is still possible to predict all of them, but it has prevented this film from being a complete wreck to watch it. There is a film worse than watching it there, although I do not think this film will win any new lives. <br /> <br /> 4/10
