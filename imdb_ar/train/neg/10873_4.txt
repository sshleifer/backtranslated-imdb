Many people think this movie is good but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the film, the spacecraft landed on Earth and some aliens fled from the spaceship, and then some people were killed on the ground, but for no reason. Also, it's in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> A few days later, the predator came to earth but no one had sent signals to him before, he should not know what happened on the ground, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the foreign master and killed him for no reason. Did not live on earth, would not happen here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, and the summary is too short and can not tell the storytellers clearly. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think this film is a good movie.
