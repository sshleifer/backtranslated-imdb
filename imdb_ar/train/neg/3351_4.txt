The influence (effect) for no reason is not generally possible in the real world but in the new Hollywood movie world, it is not only possible, it is possible. Haunting was granted a computer treatment courtesy of a first-rate filmmaker who showed promise (Jan de Bont-Speed) but has since produced a series of large budget litter (Twister, Speed ​​2). <br /> <br /> The actor is superfluous in a movie of this kind and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as if they want to be anywhere but in this movie. Lili Taylor tries to add something to the actions, but no matter what is unknown because the text looks like half of it is missing. Only events occur, good and bad ghosts appear without rhyme or reason, and the story ends only with a very unsatisfactory event designed to close the previous 90 minutes of madness. <br /> <br /> There is really no sense in seeing this for effects because we all know that anything can be displayed on the screen right now. Why do not you see the effects in a good story service rather than just for them?
