It's funny that I find myself forced to review this film, but I'm here. <br /> <br /> I'm reviewing it, because I recently had the opportunity to watch the revival of R.C. Sheriff's "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gains, Jefferson Maes and others, in addition to being directed brilliantly by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> The theater is broken. I do not exaggerate, I was amazed. After nearly two and a half hours of filming a very terrified and terrifying life of the soldier in the trenches of the Sum (Athen), during World War I, which revived them dynamically, by all concerned, I came out of the theater with a shake. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I'm not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I am a theater actor and director, I know buttons that are pressed to achieve certain effects, emotionally as well as psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I just saw, came a lot in life, that I have chills in the spine and I leave. <br /> <br /> None of these feelings came to life, while watching "Aces High", the movie that relies on this play and even adapted to the screen, in collaboration with RC Sharif himself, shortly before his death. <br /> <br /> The screen is adapted to the skies of France. So, the difficult atmosphere is over to begin. <br /> <br /> In addition to the only film, the aerial battle scenes, which seem to be dated in their special effects, are compared to today's standards, but are still very valid in on-screen flight tactics. <br /> <br /> Granted that there were some modifications on the screen for "Eriac Maria de Remarque", which happens in the trenches, not in the sky, but that was the "German" vision about things, If one wishes to be picky about such things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is just the other side of the medal, and it could have been transformed into a great movie, if left alone and intact. <br /> <br /> Transport on a bad DVD, although on a widescreen screen and air-conditioned with 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the movie itself is the quality of a movie theater. No more, no less. The game has many disadvantages, such as minor scratches and points, although the copy, for the rest, is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another World War I movie in your collection, especially for those who like and enjoy seeing air battles between the old timers, this is a picture of you. But I prefer to suggest "von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although the film is also full of mistakes, <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who like good acting and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy the play. Go to see the play, if you have a chance to get her decent revived near you, but save this modification as possible. <br /> <br /> It's an anti-war movie, but not the weakest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson, and John Gilgod is just a trick, because they have just seen very weak roles in a short veil throughout the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all perform very poorly, not because of their lack of skills, but because of a lack of real skills and a strong direction. <br /> <br /> There are many gaps in it, and as has been said before, it draws itself to the doubtful end. Doubtful because in the original play, none of the men we recognize and sympathize with survive. They were all killed on a deadly and useless mission. All die in the film, except for Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to survive another day, being the wing leader of a handful of luck, just to receive three other pilots for travel and death for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a naked stage in total darkness. You just hear the roar of guns, automatic machine guns, and the effects of grenades all over the theater. Then, suddenly, complete peace and silence. The curtain comes. Lights. And here they are all. Stand up, stand straight and rigid. The obedient bodies ... <br /> <br /> More interesting and much more shocking than the conclusion of the "high aces", which are drawn by the hair as well. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to rule. <br /> <br /> To me, if I have money and contacts to do this, I will take the play and develop it in the intended way. Add here and there scene movement in this area, only to visualize the horror and "external" slaughter that occurs in the "evil fields of France", around the men concerned, but then, just carefully focused on what is going on, in this small "hut" And the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want a film like this? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> This is not it.
