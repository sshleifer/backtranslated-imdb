I went to this movie with expectations, out of hype, it would be insightful and lift morale. Certainly something more than a cheap promotion for Wilco. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of detective and recovery about "the process", an unquestionably disgraceful image of the band members who were kicked out by the lead singer and songwriter Prima Donna, a devastating confession by a falling friend - for 18 years, for example - saying "friendship is on its way," and this unconventional, unconvincing story about how a "hurt their feelings" mark was recorded by drowning them, only so that the band could get 50 more shows right away (oh, Tension ... no!) They did their best to make it look like a strain, but I think it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy Did not exist. This does not take into account the long stretches where we get many of her new songs that move us completely without any story or vision or even a decent job in the cinema. The tense attempts at emotional sincerity or the logical perspective of life have led to my illness. <br /> <br /> From this movie, this band looks like a bunch of miserable little children who are wandering around to find a voice they do not do and they think they are a sort of guardian of the art of music, and they certainly are not. I thought music sucked, and I could not even understand the words because of the buzzing style of the main singer. <br /> <br /> Give it 2/10.
