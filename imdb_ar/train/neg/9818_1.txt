This film raises a number of pressing questions in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tilly keep up the career of acting all these years based on this ridiculous voice and the very limited range of facial expressions she uses? Second, what was responsible for making this abhorrent and disgusting movie on the face of the earth? Thirdly ... because there are people who are perverted enough to make such a disposal decision, there should not be someone in the system - the studio, the distributors or any place - who is sensible enough to prevent its completion and actual release. You should really search through too long to view another movie so bad like this ... It is not being described as a horror film - which can be considered as belonging to any legit film genre project, is definitely. The film spreads from start to finish in the most insane, violent and abusive manner, with no essential features at all. I do not really support censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I can not really see how anyone can draw anything positive from watching such a movie.
