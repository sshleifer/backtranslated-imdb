The "special practice" is being woven into a somewhat successful and well-written "Gray's Anatomy". The cast is wonderful. The hypothesis may even work. But the writing is awful. <br /> <br /> The first pilot, a renegade like Gray's Anatomy, should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a coincidence. So you set the DVR on the pilot tape and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> While I was watching the pilot, I was just wondering how this kind of group of good actors could bring together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck people up and keep them back for more information. There is supposed to be a thrill, a flash, a wonderful writing, and an interesting story with a cliffhanger who needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this offer had nothing of this. <br /> <br /> I think it was just a coincidence, I only saw the second episode and it hopes to achieve the best. Although marginally better, it does not come close to what should be interesting and can not be missed on television. <br /> <br /> I just removed this view from my software list to view it. Not worth the effort of the IMO and I would be very surprised if this show was over until the middle of the season. Pass this one up people.
