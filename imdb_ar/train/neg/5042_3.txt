The main complaint of this film is the fact that I can not tell who it is. There is no deliberate racism, but these Asians look alike! I can tell the story fairly, but you can check it as far as you go. The identities of peoples are not a mystery, if they were a mystery I would care for them. Instead, I did not turn them off the screen as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> This film has taken a number of broad shots and emotional silent faces. Heck is boring, not only do I know these people, but they just sit there. <br /> <br /> Production is typical of Chinese John Wu, a terrible video with opaque scenes. This sounds a bit better than Fulltime Killer (which was a great movie). You might think of an appropriate budget that they could at least make it look like Hollywood in the 1990s. I did not know that the Chinese had artistic icons.
