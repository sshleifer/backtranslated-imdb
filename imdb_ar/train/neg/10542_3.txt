Detective Russell Logan (Le Diamond Phillips) has a big problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Cooper), who was helped by the psychic Tess (Tracy Griffith), was captured in the capture, with the first force (which the devil gave him after being executed in the gas chamber) and could own. The bodies of the weak. In a way, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (who has an understanding of what they are facing), will have to stop Channing or that many women will have to die on his bloody hands. They will ask for help from Sister Margaret (Elizabeth Arlen), who tried to inform her superiors at the First Catholic Church in The First Power, but were denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing ... A passage through a code that could penetrate Channing's heart to rid the world of its evil. She will take her anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess to prepare her for a satanic ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mikilti Williamson, always a trusted and welcome actor, enjoys Russell's partner, so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this kind, everyone dies around Russell, but when he tries to kill Channing, he only kills the weak host of some of his other poor souls. <br /> <br /> The mysterious labyrinth is pure .. stupid from the gate of the finish line. Phillips and Griffith tried, I'll give them that, but in such a situation, they have no chance. Cooper, who is often always effective as a heavy force, does not really deliver more than a villain who sneaks in the air and eats a rotten joke.
