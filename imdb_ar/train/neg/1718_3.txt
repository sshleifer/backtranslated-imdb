I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Betty / Donawi version, as her costumes and languages ​​reflect real pictures taken by the gang. Particularly well is the death of Bac Barrow, the arrest of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the pictures taken on Blanche's day and is sad for her deceased husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and is still a beautiful antagonist until its end, even after they were exposed to a bursting of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the previous year to ambush her, and the cheerleader did not seem cheerful at the time of her death) . The scenario is dull, the representation is lousy, especially the prospects. Very disappointing. Stick with Betty and Danaaway. The "real story" may not be a great movie.
