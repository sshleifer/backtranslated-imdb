I chose this film through the cover which was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were hateful. The girl was pretty but the story and the acting were awful. It had nothing to do with surfing the Internet. A terrible movie that has a "feature" for browsing has nothing to do with browsing and not a real browser. Catherine Zeta-Jones was beautiful and the film will probably see a new comeback because she's in the spotlight now. She's married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you do not see her, do not waste your time. A bad movie with a wonderful surfing, surreal and amazing surfers, was beautiful cinematography in the hands of God.
