When this was released, I thought this was one of the most debased movies ever. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been the worst wise films of this ... but this is a very brutal assault on a person's ears. Hey, I can handle a lot of it, but that's ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard half a dozen of using the Lord's name in vain plus countless words f. I wonder how many people went out of the theater to watch this in 1990? I could not be the only person. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that some of the best actors are Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bert Young, Jerry Auerbach and Ricky Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the role of Jackson's "Stonewall" gods in "The Gods and Generals." The role of Lange here is quite the opposite: perhaps the most trivial person in the film and the character falls in love with the transsexual at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> These are just a few of the qualities that people - even some liberal critics - have used to describe this story, which were painted worse in the novel. Of course, some well-known critics, all of them radical liberals, have praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as were all the almost paid public. It is unreasonable to praise a person for filth and trash like this. <br /> <br /> Believe me, there are no good characters in this whole movie. This is an average film and a disease: one of the worst "modern times". That is, unless you enjoy watching child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, and over two consecutive hours of nothing but ordinary atrocities and bad guys. no thanks.
