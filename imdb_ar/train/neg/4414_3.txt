Christopher Durang must be taught by a terrible and unforgettable nun, because he can not abandon this concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius Explain It All For You" has been shown - at least in Hollywood - in the same tone as Diane Keaton's lectures here. Mary's sister was an exaggeration, a spell, a bitter irony of a nun enjoying great confidence, and a very monk's creed - and as she played with Lynne Redgrave, she was a joy. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration very seriously - while, as we have said, we keep the same tone in scenes that "illustrate everything". The two approaches approach the clash and in the last twenty minutes, the film goes off the track and drowns in the gorge and explodes. There are no survivors. It was possible to succeed, if the tone of the viewer with the previous four students, and her confrontation with Sister Mary, had been warned like the scenes of Sister Mary. Or if Mary's sister's scenes are more realistic. This way simply does not work at all.
