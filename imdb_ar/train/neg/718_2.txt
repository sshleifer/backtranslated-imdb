The main reason people still care about Carlton Brown of the Foo is that it displays Peter Sellers in a second role. But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Selers Sellers Amphibolos, the mysterious reptile prime minister of the state of Gilaridia, a poor, former British colony, now hosts many ransom riders during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wanted to play American and Soviet interests against each other for an easy profit, "everything is very friendly and all our cards are under the table." Terry Thomas is a title character, a lazy British diplomat eager to show Gilardia that Great Britain has not forgotten them, and all appearances are the opposite. <br /> <br /> A positive review here says: "The reason for this movie is considered average because the comedy has been reduced." I would argue that why Carlton Brown is considered mediocre is that comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that identifies only the two forces of the film, a sympathetic expression with Terry Thomas and John Addison full on the Larkey, things soon slowed to a series of slow burns and jokes of lame communication. Carlton Brown's lack of opinion by his boss and the ambiguity of Gaylardia (which no one can find on the map) is milk to death. By the time we actually got to the island (after a funny series of comic jokes), expectations were very low. <br /> <br /> It is still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist either in Latin America or in the Mediterranean, is pathetic at the airport's honor guards, and the viewing position collapses in the middle of the show. It seems that the army still attracts horses, which allows another audio broadcaster calmly lame: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers are never in the lead even when we are back on the island of his character. The plot is instead captured by Ian Panen as King of Lauris, who inherits the throne of Gailardia after the assassination of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his role straight as it is written. Usually this makes it a potential target to steal the scene by the Sellers, but trapped behind a thick tone and greasy shark, Sellers represents only a threat to those of us who remember him with greater happiness in two other films this year. "The Mouse That Roared" and "I'm Fine Jack. "This film, like" Jack ", was a production of Boulting Brothers, where Roy Boulting works here as co-director Jeffrey Dell. Boulting films usually combine between the sinister social scorn and comedy that revolves around anything, but here there is only jam in both directions. Amphibulos works in his desire for distorted English in all its importance ("This man looks like, how can you say, the bull in the Chinese ship") while Carlton Brown generally flops by his boss much more than he seems worth. <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest-lasting element in the film is the friendship of young Loris with Elena. He scored one point for playing Luciana Baluzi's charming game, linking one to the fact that they were apparently cousins. <br /> <br /> The film will end with a drama that will not be surprised by its sudden decision and little work by Carlton Brown who seems to be literally hanging the lid on his coffin. It seems to live to see another day, but the movie of the same name is DOA accurately.
