I put a mark on it as a "spoiler" just because of some of my comments on the content of the show, and not for the content itself. <br /> <br /> As I read the comments, it is clear that these Republicans accept the show in one way or another but its disdain, while the Democrats seem to enjoy the so-called honesty. One reader even (apparently) points out that he believes these events have occurred or could have happened when Bush was in primary school. <br /> <br /> As for content as I see it, trying to be neutral, it is that the group that made this series must really be who Bush really hates. In the episode I finally saw, s02e03, he showed that the program must be put together before McCain becomes the first runner for nomination; because all other former contestants are distinguished. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of the addition in the rooms. I thought that this series should have been made in Europe certainly not in the USA, because I do not know that the USA does not have any house in the cupboards, most likely in the homes of artists. While I watch the show, yes, I've been preoccupied with it, and I'm surprised to see what a great desire to book should be in doing what they can to embarrass our president. Sure, there are problems because most Americans will agree, but that's not a reason to hate public displays that are seen all over the world. Perhaps the direction is now determined by this offer and the network, so that if Obama or Hillary joins, will they continue to produce the same kind of "humor" and ventilation? <br /> <br /> Just one other comment on commentator comments. If there was some kind of change in the election back in 2000, according to the writer, he was sure that there would be a perfectly acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. With regard to the 911 events, I think it was postponed when Clinton was president, and I can not see whether Gore is president, it would be anything very different.
