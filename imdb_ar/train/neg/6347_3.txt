Maybe I'll always go to see Woody Alibe, where no one knows when he might really return to his former glory. Just a moment or moments or wonderful lines can make them worthwhile. Unfortunately this movie just does not make it to any degree. To tell the truth is what makes me sad and guilty. I'm sure my reaction is pretty much like many of Woody's other fans, but what can one say? Maybe it's time for him to focus on his clarinet, which in my opinion, is pretty good. When all this is said, I will still go to any new film that Woody may release in the future. There is always hope and I will still love and respect my friend !!
