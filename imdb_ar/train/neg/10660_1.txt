I pity the people who call good Kamal "ulaganaayakan" maybe for them ulagam tollywood! Hey guys ... this movie is a thrilling movie without suspense .. <br /> <br /> Get out of your first world and watch some high-level thriller movies like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs. <br /> <In technically good condition, but the elegance of the essence of perfection does not look like a police officer, there is no suspense or drag at all until the end may provide 3 hours worth of your life if you skip to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at his best is the best in Towlwood
