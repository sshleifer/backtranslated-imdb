I do not really understand how someone can give this disgusting movie more than one star ... How can you like this underdog movie, where are all scenes of real animal abuse? I do not even want to imagine the painful pain felt by these innocent living creatures in those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them for no reason or only for money? I tell you, this director is either mentally retarded, or he is just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. It is really worth cutting off his hands and burning him. <br /> <br /> It contains many horrific barbaric scenes that may cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: the real frog with live skin, the fish misled sadistically and thrown back into the water, a dog was beaten, and the birds were thrown into the water. .. <br /> <br /> This film is more than scary; it must be the worst and most late film ever, along with another film, called "cannibal" or "something like that". I will not watch or buy any film directed by this beast without a heart. No one should waste his time watching it, especially when there are a lot of really wonderful movies, where all scenes of animal abuse are displayed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was liked by only a few people - which is a natural reaction, because it is the worst film ever - so it was not successful. I hope that this backward filmmaker realizes that such unwarranted brutality and cruelty on real animals will not be praised and that he will display all scenes of animal abuse in his next films. I truly believe that everyone receives but what they offer! There will be a day when the "backward" and "human" people will feel the same pain they have inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> However, this may be my only negative assessment. I usually do not comment on a film if I do not like it, but this time I could not keep silent. I had to talk about the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
