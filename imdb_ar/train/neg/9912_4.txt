I fully agree with one reviewer here who was delighted "For the Birds" won the Academy Award in 2002 for "Best Short Animation Film", not this sick article, which is at best parody and attractive to anyone, of course, has no belief in Heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but so were many animated short films. By the way, I loved the dark humor, but that was not attractive from the start. <br /> <br /> For the story here: a man walking around surrounded by nothing but gray (symbol code here) is listed by a television (shown every few hundred meters) and it is in heaven, hell or disinfectant. Each time he puts a gun on his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I think this would be funny in two of the three cases.
