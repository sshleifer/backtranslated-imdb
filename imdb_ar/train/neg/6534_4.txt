This scientific adventure is neither the best nor the worst. I agree with the saying that science fiction is a comedy. This favorite color is odd pink and unusual special effects make this a favorite place for late and late viewers. Space explorers on Mars are fighting giant mammoths and other exotic creatures. Great to a great extent. <br /> <br /> Staff include Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel upset if you stop for a moment. I agree with adding this to the classic cult list do not miss out.
