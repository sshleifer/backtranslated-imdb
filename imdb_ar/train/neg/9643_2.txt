Below average film with poor music looking at film based music ?? Regular script and routing with full errors. Salman Khan was in his usual behavior. Ajay's performance has been deteriorating over time as his looks were especially that his style of rockstar music was pathetic. Asin was just a technical show. In general, I felt wasted in cinema. Salman Khan is still immature 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the whole boring movie except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the UK music sponsor was admiration. The word "Khan Abadouche" can easily be understood by an English music patron. The other film I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which was a simple slow love story with a good direction and representation despite the middle music
