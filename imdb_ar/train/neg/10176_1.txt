Starring: Scott Bacalla, Eric Bruscotter, Corbin Brensen, Denise Hesbert, Jensen Daggett, written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes received PG-13 rating (for the language) And some violence) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in the new John Warren comedy "LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINSS" scene. It consists of a sequence where an angry coach throws a baseball ball hard into the wall behind him just to hit the cement and be reflected and crushed in the face. Not much, but with the exception of a few individual lines, all that the film offers ... is enough. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally disabled, undifferentiated, predictable and badly written, but also very bad. Even members of the non-critical public will hate this film with all they have received. Fashionable it is not funny. <br /> <br /> How often should the same film be produced about sport? In the past years, we have seen this same article in the "Air Bud: Golden Receiver", and in the worst of this film, it was worse. At least the Bud Air was family oriented. "Main League Back to the Palace" is a cliche for the helpful family that can not be seen together on Sunday afternoon. It's very childish for adults. So who is this film? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are in desperate need of entertainment and rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The movie, like many others, contains one basic point: trying to stir up teamwork. Yes it is, and what a great moral try to prove. Too bad we have already seen and excluded them many times over and over again and we have little talent and intelligence so that the heads of their teams of men are dressed in ballerina. "This guy is out of the ball for a while to find something lost - maybe that's in his mind," someone said. What he needs to nap, "and" ever sees the sunset as beautiful as that play. "Where these characters have little importance to each other so that we never know by name, and where the scene of the only heartbeat of collective action is so unconsciously funny. <br /> <br /> "The main league back to the palace" is very bad; it's stalls at the end of the vulgar right The good baseball team in the return, they are about to win and - the power runs out.I was thinking for a moment that this piece of garbage has come to an end, but in fact, its last faulty scene exists only to add minutes to runtime. The film is basically a series of unrelated drawings that are aimed at a lot of rotten jokes, they are not funny, there is another kind of funny dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long player does not want this job longer. The coach replied: "You are too old, very slow and very fat." The player's reaction is to die for. But this scene certainly does not make this movie worth noting your time, and certainly not worth the cents of your money. <br /> <br /> So there is another horrific entry in this type of film, another one ruled by his own text, which failed before watching it, and another very familiar that seems to be deja vu again. <br /> <br />
