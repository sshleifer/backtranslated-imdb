I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. This seems logical because most zombie movies have their place there. From the "Romero" trio to "28 days later." However, when you watch it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that is gradually progressing and increasing in number. There is no horror here people. Just some regular motion scenes in the middle of the road that quickly tire because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you will feel that you may have missed the DVD player in three minutes, but no, that's how they actually made the film. This is pathetic. I think anyone could find a better use of the $ 7 million film industry in making this lump. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but again, they were used too much and tired because they were the same trick again and again each time, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what is permanently annoying is the linkage to the game clips of the card game. I played the game. Absorbs. Why did they put him here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie but a music video, a bad film. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Assessment R: A lot of violence / injustice, and profanity
