I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he was thinking when he made this film. Usually if he did a bad film, he blamed the screenwriter or director, but in that case, that's all. The absorption of this film is all his fault. It proves that even Histon can make the story of Shakespeare interesting. I have wasted two and a half hours of my life in this snooze festival and will not get this time. This is by far the Histon movie I have seen in my life. If you're a Shakespeare fan, you might find this movie fun, but if you do not waste your time, you'll regret it in the long term.
