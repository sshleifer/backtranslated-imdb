Even if you can get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every important moment of the 1960s (well, so Katie did not join the Mansons, and nobody died in Altamont), this film was still incredibly shocking. I have the impression that "writers" closed themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone in the 1960s again and again as a research. A Canadian television critic described the closing of the first episode "Head Spinning". He was right.
