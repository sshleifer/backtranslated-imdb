Well, they say that sexual desire makes you unhappy. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) is eligible for my bedwetting, but she definitely has sex with men. She is still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, although she seems to be of her age should have a good idea now. (However, I can not agree with anyone who says that Young is too big to play her role.) If so, we must live very well.) This film often left me cool, although it was not the worst of all The kind you'll ever see. Unlike "Eyes Wide Shut", at least something happens in this.
