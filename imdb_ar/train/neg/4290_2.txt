I will give this movie two stars because it is full of beautiful pictures. Otherwise, it is mainly filled with clich√©s and stereotypes: mountain dwellers are either stupid white trash of the religious or fanatical racial type, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move silently, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds at long distances. And so forth. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I kept wondering about the purpose of the film (other than showing beautiful pictures of the mountains, wood cabinets, forests, and a variety of animals, free of the mountainous people and the terrifying people in the church). <br /> <br /> The plot has touched on a whole range of issues but has not explored any of them in depth. This was not a story about your growing up during the Depression, nor about being an orphan, or about a struggle for identity. Try to be all these things and more, making them superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film was supposed to be about Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. A short summary of the history of his people (who was brave and stoical) and a distillation demonstration was presented; his hand tried to cut wood (which failed) and whiskey monsters (literally); learned how to read (and perhaps write) with the help of a grandmother and her dictionary - and that's what happened. It seems that he did not learn much during his time at the boarding school because he was trapped in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, Grandma, Grandma and Graham Greene's personality proved that Little Tree eventually became the spiritual person whose primary goal was as an adult - yet, I rephrased it here, "riding with Navajos" and "falling into two wars "- was" catching up "with the personality of Grandpa and Grandma and Graham Green's character in paradise (instead of, for example, dating girls, getting married, having children or such nonsense). <br /> <br /> Last but not least I must say I found a commercial attack on Grandpa. Why should all whiskey be? To counter the stereotype of "Indian drunk"?
