Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, sorry ... treasure "protector", whatever that means) who descends from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his predecessors was given an idea of ​​the whereabouts of a huge treasure. Our founding fathers, most if not all, decided to hide because they just did not want to finance their independence badly. <br /> <br /> The first evidence was that the long-lost ship was hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, made up of financier Ian (Sean Bean), Dorek Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigi") and two unidentified persons enter the cargo ship. They immediately leaked tons of gunpowder all over the land, not that this is important in any way. In the end they found the guide (a skeleton swirling above it) and turned out to be a tube with writing ... it. Somewhat. Do not ask me to explain it. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery, and despite the fact that his mission is clearly annoyed by not finding the actual treasure, Gates is walking around shouting himself about the meaning of the mystery, in these frozen goods, while the crew stands around the jaw. I mean come. Someone should have been a bit vocal in his disappointment of reaching the stunning North Pole and not finding anything interesting, but they only stand there when Gates enters his own world and solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> The following idea becomes the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is appalling. Different characters offer a clear definition of resentment (get used to it). All this leads to Ian pulling a gun at Gates, and the gunpowder explodes in a big explosion. (Oh, that's why they all leaked out the gunpowder! Huh!) Ian and his followers are running away, and Gates and the movie Rookie Riley are walking nine miles in under-zero temperatures to Enwitt village in order to stop them. <br /> <br /> To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archiver Abigail Chase (Diane Krueger), Gates and Riley must steal them themselves. He then tells Riley Gates the tragic details of why they can not steal the ad, because it is very protected from metallic eyes and laser and high-tech security Blah Blah. Gates tells Riley that there is a chance to steal her from the storage room. Do you know what Riley is the storage room, asks Gates? "Where do they make jam and jelly?" I'm not kidding; this is the actual line. Bartha does not deliver like a joke, either. So Riley is doing all this research about the Library of Congress, Archives, Water and Sanitation, fercryinoutloud, but he does not know what a conservation room is. This largely indicates the level at which this script runs. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short, Gates actually makes it with D of I, in a ridiculous breakthrough that can only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way computer screen technology is portrayed in movies - full of unimaginable and impractical graphics and lines.) Abigail Chase ends up labeling for comfort, and as a clear "love interest" angle. At one point, the three, who fled the law, discussed all their plans loudly in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of evidence and the kidnapping of the father of Gates, played by indecisive John Voight, leads both good and bad people to the huge Indiana Jones Theater under New York City. Strangely, the subway builders did not find this thing. Gates and Gates lead senior Ian on a wild goose chase. Ian is believed to be trapped in a dead end and leaving them there. However, after their departure, Riley asks how they will get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... boy ... <br /> <br /> ... presses a button and opens the door. No, I am serious. Button, such as they may have a toilet emptied in the office building. Something good was known where it was. However, after further circumventing the handle, find this enormous treasure room (remember that all this is under Manhattan!) Filled with all kinds of historic golden things. Riley gets to make a really stupid line. one more time. FBI agents Harvey Keitel, Sean Penn, and the two non-chemist fantasies are allowed to marry. <br /> <br /> For any scenes, I think it will be hard to ignore all this show, leaps of logic, and stereotypes for a very long time. Although some of his performances include nice historical lessons that are included in the conversation at random moments. I would like more conversations like that in my life.
