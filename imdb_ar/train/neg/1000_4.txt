Descent's plot, if it can actually be named, contains two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one in the end. These events collectively constitute 5% of the total film time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) between them is basically a desperate director's effort to fill the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I love dark movies and I'm not worried about the bold scenes - but if you expect me to sit in 60 minutes of dark / dark scenes (literally) with no story, you have something else to come. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is totally lost here. No, do not feel shame, nor even in the NC-17 version, which I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to get rid of it and want to watch "Descent", take a nap instead - maybe you will have more interesting dreams.
