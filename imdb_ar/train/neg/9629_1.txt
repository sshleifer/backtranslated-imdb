I've seen this for free, and fortunately, I wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to have imposed on us in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer play Aniston as a opposing couple - yet are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this scheme does not take you to a surprise and you like it, it will not be. <br /> <br /> Lots of gags and jokes farting. In the middle of the film, I began to realize that Ben Stiller was not really funny, but he was trying hard. Jennifer Aniston is not really beautiful, but her hair is gorgeous. Hank Azarya and Philip Seymour Hoffman must have paid a lot of money to be in this kind of medium film. I came to expect more of them. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that I saw this after seeing the American Spendor, a really funny and original film, and comparing them in my head, and I found myself hoping that the film executives would have to sit through these two films again The back - maybe this will knock out some of their feeling and <br /> <br /> they will start producing better movies with the unknown rather than those picture objects that play the best in airplanes.
