When I saw the preview of this on TV I was thinking, "Well, I'll become a good wolf movie" but it was not. It was not scary at all! The disposition was good, the plot was terrible, and the military parade was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel can do better than this folly. Making the film seem as if Arron was going to be turned into a wolf, instead turning to a psychiatrist and scaring some doctors off the throat. If I have read some of my other comments on other films, they are all positive, but this is not simply because the story was awful. One out of 10 max. I'm sure you're expecting some wolf flick, but I bet you do not expect this. After Loch Nes was better than this movie, make sure that any movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
