This one serves as a satire during the age of women's rights movement. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (Experience) is a great experience to look at. It runs in the same context as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still being tamed), which is a standard fluff at prices. What I mean in this film is to be a simple arithmetic to recognize it. Anyone who spends time away from a regular job by training a group of crazies who earn their way to sudden victory, is wasted. It's the same feeling you might feel after watching this. Nice attempt to throw the opposite sex for the man's duty, but I expected better things.
