This is easily the worst Scott Ridley movie. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Vigo Mortensen, both of whom abuse a highly complex film about a girl who goes to the army. so stupid. There is no one convincing scene at all. It's not really hard to make a film like this. Everything the crew does is probably just an idea for anyone. The book did not have much inspiration either; many senseless dialogues made no sense at all; and some reckless work. I highly recommend staying away from this litter. I hope the talented people involved in this project realize that this type of film is not worth their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and intelligent films than this useless mess.
