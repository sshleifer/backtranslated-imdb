This movie is indulged in the trash. Watch this movie if you just want to hear the spoken spoken language or enjoy the fun soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It must be charming but not so - it's just annoying. Characters are difficult to take care of and weak representation. Stories within the film are also enchanting and wicked. I was expecting a loving family film, but that did not please my 14-year-old daughter. I rarely see a film until its end, but this film got our best. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been set at present, it is characterized by the appearance of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War. There is not even enough beautiful scenery in Scotland and cinematography to recover. It's a real shame because it's such an embarrassment to Scotland.
