I remember when the Golden Boy was released in 1986, he was criticized internationally by critics, and I am so angry that he ended up with Eddie Murphy's glittering career, so I think this film has something going on <br /> <br /> A bad start begins Buddhist monks kneel before a child with an empty expression on his face. The villains enter the temple <br /> <br /> The child sits empty-handed <br /> <br /> The wicked cut off the monks <br /> <br /> The child sits empty-handed <br /> <br /> The villains pull the bird cage Giant and stick inside the baby who now sits with ... Come guess? You have the impression that even if they take him to sleep at Michael Jackson's Wonderland farm that was still giving her the same empty expression, this movie will be better titled The Wooden Child <br /> <br /> The title sequence begins as a film since the 1980s , And features pop music in a big way. Obviously this may have been fantastic and funky at the time, but in 2004, it seems very dated. Not only that, but it is also fairly bloody. In fact, the main problem (and the boy is a serious problem) with this film - it seems that the whole mood changes from scene to scene so that it sometimes looks like watching scenes from completely different movies threaded together. I personally blame the director, but it must be noted that both the scriptwriter and the producer must share the blame. Did anyone know before the shooting what kind of film he would have been? It is part of the imagination, part of the martial arts, part of the film friends, part of the comedy and will be issued crap
