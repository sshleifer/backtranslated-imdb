How can a film with Amy, Posey and Raechel not laugh at it? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' did it better and more entertaining. Hopefully the managers have spent a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them. It's cliche from start to finish. Cliches can work well with script, or at least an idea. This film does nothing but use cliches after cliches rather than ideas or texts. The existing person is used by actresses instead of character development. Bad, sad, garbage. Now it seems I have ten lines of text to comment. really? why? As IT Operations Manager this is another example of filthy coding.
