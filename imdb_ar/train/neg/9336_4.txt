The weak-crime criminal drama was used in the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier plays a starring role in the role of a nurse who becomes the representative of a single woman after he makes drug trafficking loopholes from Coffy's petty sister. Violent nonsense crushes violently along, with canned energy and excitement. Only the tempered mood of Grayer gives the narrative a shake (not much represented here, but it communicates with the audience in a primitive way). Not much different from what Charles Brunson was doing at the time. The film was commercialized and advertised as a great exploit, yet managed to find a large audience within the city. However, today it is just a footnote in the history of the 1970s, and lacks a wide range of other films of this genre. * 1/2 of ****
