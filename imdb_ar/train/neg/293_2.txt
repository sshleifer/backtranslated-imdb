The film mainly revolves around some of the girls in a Catholic school who end up in trouble by putting a red dye in one of their classmates' shampoo at school. After reprimanding the act, they decide to take off for Florida for a holiday. On their way there, they met some players at a local restaurant and decided to meet with each other somewhere later. The girls end up on a roadside near the forest and stop for a while. While one of the girls decides to walk around, she sees a murder involving the local police chief himself. You become frightened and go to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go look at her and kill two of them by the killer. The two remaining girls are then captured by the killer and placed in a local prison cell. At the same time, the Vice-Dean watches the girls and despite their insistence that the Brigadier is the killer who ignores them and works as ignorant and everyone else in this film who can not put two or two together some of the hideous hidden acts. When this. The best part is the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where she decides to rape her in her prison cell. The girl actually seems to want to be raped by this man and the nude scene he admits was good but before that their lips meet he has other things in mind. This film reminds me of the low-pitched "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon's staring, the same motive behind a different character. It's a movie that does not deserve a lease, not even for a low-cost film in the 1980s, and the end was the worst end I've ever seen in a movie, leaving me wanting to get my money back!
