This movie was given a rating of 1 (awful). The only reason for getting the number 1 instead of the big number is Ben Kingsley, who always shines regardless of the terrible stuff being thrown. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is out of her element here, as a viewer, one can simply overcome the fact that she is even in such a piece. <br /> <br /> A stupid story, stupid, and terrible production. Do not waste your rental video.
