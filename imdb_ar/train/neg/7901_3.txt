. . . This is bad, because at least if it was a Troma film, he would have been subjected to brutal violence and a greater sense of abandonment, which may have lifted my classification slightly. <br /> <br /> So what do we have instead tame (rated PG), barely lukewarm, and low budget (produced by Roger Kurman with an unknown director then unknown) Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -wannabe with the spirit The almost exclusive humor about the logic that made Gremlins work well - logic is fanciful or not, no suspense, no sense of adventure, no violence or nudity to make up for it. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure some of the problems in the film are inherent in the scenario - let's face it, no one can make these jokes so funny - it seems that the biggest blame must be in the lap of director Bettina Hersh. In more capable hands, Munchies could have been fun. <br /> <br /> After all, it begins like many great adventure movies. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru with archaeological excavations. Simon is an eccentric archaeologist who has always sent theories about the links between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he believes he sees evidence of laser cutting in ancient stone works. So they understand in Machu Picchu looking for more evidence on Simon's theories when it happens in a secret room. Inside, they quickly found the animal they later called Arnold, one of the most delicious foods. <br /> <br /> They took Arnold home to their small desert town of California. Simon, who believes that Arnold is a foreign creature, must go to a classmate's lecture, and he plans to tell the colleague that he finally has a strange specimen. Paul and his very kind friend, Cindy (Nadine van der Velde), are in charge of Arnold, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unguarded as they leap into the bag. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the brother of Simone Cecil (who also plays Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack company, is eager to buy Simon's house and land - two adjacent to his home. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil hits a plot to steal Arnold. Things began to gradually spiral out of control, and the foods that had a suitable chain to get close to her passion for junk food began to sweep the town. <br /> <br /> This reads better in a summary of what the screen is playing on. The best shots in the film are those that have natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters walk on the outskirts of the desert city. Interior designs, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look bad, cheap, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hersh is not very skillful in preventing shots and preparing them. Strangely enough, given the lack of overall production design, Cecil's home is a gem, saturated as in the 1980s, exaggerated to the smallest detail. Cecil's cousin, Dude (John Stafford), was an amusing counterpoint. So bad, he got out of the movie so quickly. <br /> <br /> In any case, Kurman is an interesting actor, but he appears much better here like Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up missing most of the film. Cecil, who was physically distinguished by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, was the "evil capitalist" only for the film, one of Korman's most impressive classic characters - which was one of his specialties, which often benefited from the "Carroll" Burnett Show Unlike the "Carroll Burnett Show", which tended to be successful because directors Clark Jones and Dave Bowers had a well-thought-out way of pushing wrestling to the brink of chaos, Hersh crushes Kurman on a very distant road, and Cecil's character does not do it The way you should work. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of other troublesome problems Even the scenes that were supposed to be an additional shoe to stir up drama - like the tragedies of being harassed by an old woman on the road - are put together away from the film. So that they do not have much effect. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical problems in the story as they are: Where did the Manchi come in the room in Machu Picchu? The film appears to be an answer, but it was released from the end The final. The most serious problem is that unlike gemstones, there is no obvious reason to move from light foods from cute fur balls to monsters. Only happens. Moreover, since Munchies kept PG, and violence is still low, when creatures are in the wild, they never threaten. As they are sent easily, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> It is recognized that the essence of the film is not suspense, horror, disguised drama or any of these other things, but humor. It is meant more than a spoof of Gremlins and countless ripping in its wake. The only problem with that is that the movie is not funny, although I laughed several times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are cute cliches. Much of the remaining material consists of non-sequential materials. Given the bad timing of Hersh, everything falls off. There was a possibility of producing a film, while it was a parody, funny and scary, fun and disturbing, cheesy and disturbing, all at the same time, Keller Klonz of Outer Space (1988). Very bad, then, that the Munchies do not come anywhere near it.
