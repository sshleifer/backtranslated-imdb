You can not imagine how I was looking for an ant king. As a huge Gordon fan, I waited for the premiere in Europe with a wicked wait. Especially because I loved Dagon - the last achievement of Gordon - a lot. The ant was introduced for the first time here in my country and Gordon was the same who made it for his presentation. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulations on that after that. The Ant King is his most inspiring and modest film yet. Indeed, the quality standard has never exceeded the normal television excitement standards. Terrain plot is terribly routine. With the exception of some bad scenes, the Gordon-touch model is never recognized. Moreover, the already weak text has more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabe-crook who has been hired to commit murder. So he does not, and of course they do not pay him. Of course he falls in love with the wife of the victim. Of course, he takes revenge on himself. Only the sequences in which a man descends into a whirlpool of madness are worth mentioning, they are the only ones who remind you of the fact that you are still watching Stuart Gordon. The performances are less than average with McCain as the lowest heroic starring, George Norm Peterson Wint as the fat bastard and Carrie Woehrer as a good-hearted sex bomb. Things are very illogical and the story becomes more obscure, while the make-up effects are not enough to satisfy amateur horror fans. I read some other comments on King of the Ants, claiming to be Gordon's best film because it was finally a thrilling and mature film. Well, if that's the case. a lot. Well, I think every good outlet runs out of strength and inspiration in the end. Too bad to beat Stuart Gordon.
