SLIGHT spoilers (but it does not matter anyway). <br /> <br /> An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions does not even deserve the l0 lines I need to put these notes on the net waves. This is the worst single episode of the Masters series to date and the first to qualify for the Mystery Science Theater. Even if it took half an hour to realize the angle of mockery, it was still a very lame mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that, in addition to protective and ugly masks, this type only works when using classical cinematic concepts of photography, lighting, dialogue, representation, editing, and timing. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is not Seda. interval. A trivial analysis of easy social commentary here will not change that. It's strange that Carpenter was never more than director B, but at least films such as "Fog" and "The Thing" had a great atmosphere (the latter is one of my favorite habits). <br /> <br /> Abusive representation. Camera angles stuck in cement. Tensile rhythm. However, perhaps the most repulsive element of this episode is the story of the story that can not be blamed on JC (unless the authors are friends of Cody.) The first two minutes of a girl running through a jungle just to be almost run over would be the Scully Moulder duo The first and last thing works in the film. But come on, a girl hunting for a deserted jungle anywhere in particular desperately needs a good abortion, with a pair of "women's rights" managers who happen to be at the end of the corner road. Oh, and I'm not going to talk about how the document discourage the accident in the car and speed it from 0 to 60 in six seconds. Are you wondering about possible broken ribs or concussion? <br /> <br /> Then things break down real fast. Invisible dialogue "I just want to help you," sluggish forward forward back and forth at the gate, great battle tactics such as cutting off the phone line (in the era of mobile phones?) Followed by the shooting: again Rambosk clinic director Ron Perlman and high school are retreating for a few kicks Easter holiday. Another beautiful line: "So what are we going to do?" From a child who was just sitting on a pile of assault rifles at the back of the truck. Er, it is not yet after the cyclist season. Who needs these little boys anyway. And what about the old tried and true way of the only soldier making his way through the gate with his American SUV? <br /> <br /> As for the exchange of lead scenes themselves, the cuts here were as harsh as the staccato of DC comics. All he lacked was Wham, Bam and Whiz from the balloon titles. Most important of all is the sound of the soundtrack worthy of the old Mannicks episode. <br /> <br /> At some point, we learned that Papa is not really the father, but at this point we were not able to pay much attention any more. The only source of drama in this story is the conflict between a pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who only thanks that she does not suffer from twins. However, there is no single scene, or flash buck, where they are found together. Just remain abstract images of each other. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the gate guard, each person is completely undesirable. Cute, hysterical, boring, muscular. As flat as a human background can be. It does not seem that any of the doctors has anything medical about them. And there is the father's quarrels riding his daughter pregnant as if he himself was her boyfriend strained. Fortunately he got. There are wonderful comic moments worth the MST: flowing when the angelica plumber comes out and then the newborn crab with its glued on the baby's head. It was also nice to belly rugby ball from Angelica before finally popping up on the little monster of Hill. For this male abortion scene ... well, they should have kept the Miike ring and banned it instead. <br /> <br /> In short, Rosemary's Baby meets Alien on the lawn at M.A.S. ring. This sting alone, which can only be estimated for today's under-16s, as someone else said here, will confirm that this series will not be renewed for a third season. It's a real shame, because there are a number of great products, including a real spoof like Dante's "Homecoming" or the delicious McKee's Mick Girl. Not to mention the brilliant images of "Fairhaired Baby" by Malone. <br /> <br /> Sorry, John Carpenter, I think your Steering Days are over. It is time to run for president.
