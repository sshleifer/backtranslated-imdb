The two good things about this film are that they are unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in the film, a young and immaculate, with looks still include her body today, steals the beginning, that is all it is, and that is it. It is clear that it has just started because its representation is improving with its next projects. <br /> <br /> Second, the result of the then famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what prevents this stink from getting one star ... Yes, I know that one star is not much, but in the case of this film , It is many. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid and meaningless horror of a couple of college students trying to clean up a residential building that is supposed to be demolished, landing one by one by a reassuring murderer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where This happens. <br /> <br /> Watch the first 18 minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
