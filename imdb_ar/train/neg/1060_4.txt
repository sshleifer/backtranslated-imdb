Well, he wrote in 1996, before September 11, so you can give him little credit for the anxiety about the terrorists and the idea that the director of the CIA is drawing up a plot to blow up this disaster-ridden plane from heaven before it brings death to the world, strangely. This is. These are the good things. Representation ... fair. The plot ... silly. "Evolution" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It is not as if no one ever thought about what to do when the plane was contaminated. Do not you think bureaucrats have evidence of "epidemics" and how they contain them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. Not sending them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. If the virus carries in the air, why was the door open and the "archers" standing there without protection? In fact, did anyone happen to shoot her legs? I'm a sucker, I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started playing it, but that was a waste of time, and often, predictable. I saw him use a record so I did not have to see all the ads, it was an added bonus, it's a good example of why I watch a very small television network.
