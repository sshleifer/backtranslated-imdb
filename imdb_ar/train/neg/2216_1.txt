I love B movies, give me a genetically mutilated bat and I'm in heaven. These good movies make you stop thinking about anything else happening in your world. Even a stupid B movie usually makes me laugh and I'll keep it a good thing. Then there was the hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First, there was the flag of the shark, a film he barely touched. In order to keep viewers interested, make sure you have blood every few minutes. During one attack scene, the camera moved away from the attack but you saw what appeared to be a bucket of blood being thrown out by a platform to let you know that the attack was bloody and that the person had died (that is, the special special effects). Back to science, I think it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and that the testing equipment required to be monitored through the breast tissue. Anyway, this film has a weak twist in the story, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say the representation is too bad. Not even William Forsyth, Hunter Tilo or Jeffrey Combs could not save this stink.
