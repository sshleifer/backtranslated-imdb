Bad study. Bad behavior, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and bad idea. The pieces of schlock do not come any more fun or unintentionally than this ... thing. At the end of the "film," you wonder why they were disturbed in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, did he have money or something? I'm still thinking about seeing this? * The spoilers: * If you do not die of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you will see where the city inhabited by cyborg named "Cytown", will. Avoid this, my friends who love movies. Avoid.
