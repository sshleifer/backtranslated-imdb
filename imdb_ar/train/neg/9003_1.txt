This film really, really means, suck. The holes got a very large plot and could fit 30 foot dragon through them. Not to mention the Dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst image created by the computer ever in the real film. I mean, when you see something like that, you have to think of "Wow, someone has already made this movie and then fired it. Of them, I'm sure they're not working in the cinema anymore. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, it was not present on the DVD, so (reluctantly) I took it out of a video. The first appeared, Lord of the Rings, for the two men. This was a very smart move, so I put this clip on the video. This justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film one star, otherwise I have given it zero. Producers may even attract the star of Dean Deen (I think so how to spell it) in crowds (uh, to the video store). <br /> <br /> Then they used the screen splitting technology (as in the case) to (I suppose) to compensate for the horror of this piece of crap. On the cover of the box, we see a picture of our hero and dragon. Does the Dragon look exactly like the shape in Dragonheart, or is it just me? Either way, the dragon appears in the film as a rejection of the Gremlins 2, and has a CGI from the wicked Nintendo video game of the early 1990s (perhaps worse). Also, Dragons are not moving because they are chasing their victims - it's the same F ## monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg - left leg, dom, dom, dom dom, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! This just pisses off me. The directors may have thought this was exciting and would have the same effect as the jaws. Why not have a Dragon POV shot. In either case, it was quite funny, like watching the Weebl Tun movie. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain presents many puzzling looks during the film (perhaps dealing with the fact that this film could end his career). Do not expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was an addition to the PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is very bad, as my 5-year-old brother can come out better when he tries not to believe lying about the reason for his futility in my room while I was not there. Oh, and have you mentioned that I F @ # King hate the people who made this unbelievably stupid movie?
