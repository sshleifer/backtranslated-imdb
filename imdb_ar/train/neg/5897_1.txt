The famous Japanese director Takashi Miki does not seem to be moving with this terrible film, which is derived from Yasushi Akimoto's book on an evil old woman (and child abuser!), Part of a new urban legend: if your cell phone rings strangely - you'll see the message " "- You will only replay the message to hear your final words before you die. The most successful part of the film is the satire of reality television cameras that prey on future victims, but the unspecified deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and frustrating. The repetitive snapshots of the dead bodies are in fact somewhat invisible, and it may be the overall orbit that ultimately causes the film to stop. Hollywood jumped unexpectedly on this elusive plot in 2008, however, the US version was not the best off. No stars from ****
