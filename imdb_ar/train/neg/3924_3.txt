A really terrible film has no end. It seems that director Bilucchio is intrigued by the beautiful face and personality of his actor Dietmers - and who can blame him? But perhaps, perhaps, his attention should have focused a little more on making a good and attractive film. I hate it when the sex film is a "technical film" just to become "more respectful." Frequent and hot sexual scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether it's worth sitting through the rest of the picture or not, it's a matter of taste. (*)
