Rarely seen since a theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become synonymous with the legendary film crisis. Now on the DVD in the handsome package unexpectedly, it is unlikely to win wide fans today as it was when it was first released. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's best-selling book in 1968 was a sarcastic phrase. Most filmmakers felt that the story, structure and tone of the novel would not be translated into a film. Workers in the industry were surprised when the 20th century Fox did not get the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. But studio executives soon had cool feet: Vidal's modifications were repeatedly rejected, and writer and director Michael Sarn was brought in to bring the film to the screen. <br /> <br /> Studio executives expressed the hope that Sarn will enter the youth market. They saw it as a goal of the film, but Sarn proved to be asynchronous with the material more than the executives themselves. Rewrite when rewriting. The cast, a disaster sensor, became increasingly militant. Commenting on the DVD, star Jacqueline Welch says she rarely had any idea of ​​Mira's motives from one scene to another or even within any one scene, and that everyone concerned seemed to be making a completely different film. In the documentary "Backstage," Rex Reed says Mira Breckendj was a film produced by a group of people who hid in changing rooms while their lawyers waited to call back. <br /> <br /> The accuracy of these comments is shown by the film itself. The basics of Vidal's story exist, but not only has the story been marginalized from all the broader implications, and it seems to have no meaning in itself. Everything works in multiple directions, there is nothing linking, and many scenes undermine any logic that previous scenes may have. While director Sarn repeatedly stated in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as a pure masquerade, the only resulting laughs were a coincidence. <br /> <br /> One of the most important of these is My West. It is true that the West is unexpectedly preserved in appearance and that it has not succeeded in any way on a journey with a line - but there is nothing about the fact that it is in its seventies, and its belief that it is still the most attractive trick in leather shoes is very troublesome, Appreciation. But even worse is the fact that the West is outside its era. Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and eventful person lead to one of the most embarrassing self-portraits I have ever seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The remaining actors have been largely wasted. Raquel Welch, the actress who has been grossly underestimated, plays the role of Mira in the title like a Barbie doll on steroids. Rex Reed is not unexpectedly active in the Myron role, but the entire role is useless. Only John Houston and leading players John Carradine, Jim Bacos, William Huber and Andy Devine are relatively safe. Yes, it is truly a disaster that everyone in the film fears to be: fast when slow, slow when it is fast, and relentlessly unfaithful from start to finish. It's true that director Sarn has an occasional inspiration - like using clips from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create an opposite point of motion - but generally, whenever Sarn chooses how to do something he seems to have made a mistake. <br /> <br /> How and why was explained in Sarne's audio commentary. Sarne did not like the novel, or the subject in general. He did not want to write a script, but he needed money. He did not want to take out the film, but he needed the money. He has made it clear that the author hates Gore Vidal and Rex Reid (one time openly saying that Reid is "not a nice person"). To this day, Vidal and Reed have worked side by side to sabotage the film because they have refused to play on their "homosexuality agenda" Which, when she returns, seems to have been their desire for Sarn to actually portray Vidal's novel instead of his own novel, which he imagined strangely. <br /> <br /> Although he spends quite a bit of time commenting, explaining that the film has broad support from the LGBT community, Sarn does not seem to understand that the film's appeal to the gay audience stems from its non-portrayal The irony of gay people. When Saren is taken along with the film itself, it appears as little more than homophobia - quite frankly, the only worst option for writers and directors who could have taken the project. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sarne and Welch's commentary and documentary films, the DVD includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a theatrical version and a "restored" version. The only difference between the two is that the last scene in the "restored" version has been printed on black and white. The edits made before the movie was released were not restored for a year, but the documentary details were the same. The wide transports to both are remarkably good and the sound is fine. But in the end from where it started, this is a film that will be of interest to film historians, film buffs, and worshipers. I give it three out of five stars for them alone, but everyone else must pass it. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Amazon
