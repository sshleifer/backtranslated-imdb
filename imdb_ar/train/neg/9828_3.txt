I've hired this by mistake. I thought, after a quick check of the box, that this was a travel story through time / science fiction. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it's a fairly typical example. If you are sold on the letter, it is likely to overlook the embarrassment of the plot / acting / etc, but I found it rather painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I was bothered to rewrite history in this story. It paints in the 1890s a kind of paradise for family values ​​and ethics (a deadly figure that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But ignores very unfavorable aspects of this "high moral" society (rigid, sexual, Proliferation, for example). At one point, the hero complains to a clothing store owner of things that do not look quite different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders about the patterns of women's clothing (as reported in the recent Wall Street Journal). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought it was the kind you would like if you liked this kind of thing, which is definitely healthy ...
