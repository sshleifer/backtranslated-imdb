I was curious to watch this movie. It seems that a lot of people are excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but am open to any kind of opinions or opinions. I do not care if Jesus is in the way he wrote in the Bible. Whether Maria is virgin or not, or all other pagan coincidences. What interests me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What angered me was when someone took the sentence, presented it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed in this film after a large sentence: "These are enemies of me who do not want to be their property - bring them here and kill them before me" (Luke 19:27) What did they do? T tell you is the context. Jesus narrated the story of an evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports murder. It's love! After quoting from the wrong Bible, they offer us the cry of people (false Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information provided until they begin to think about Jesus = hate = not good for me or anyone else. This is pure manipulation people. Please use your mind. Do not take everything as a fact telling you in this movie. We destroy our foundation and our civilization if we begin to disassemble Jesus in this way and the message he addressed to us. I saw the branch where you sit.
