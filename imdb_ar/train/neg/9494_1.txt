The only thing that surprised me more than the number of people who loved this film was that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, who was so impressed with his work. Prospects do not have any chemistry. Not for a second can I believe that there is anything deeper than lust between them. The story just did not ring true. Add to that the gruesome conversation, tons of stereotypes, an incredibly slow plot that does not lead to any place basically, and you've become stinking. Kay Linz bare scenes may be worthwhile for those seeking a fare of appetizers, but this is a huge waste of time. My thoughts and I saw the film that it was better to be entitled "cheesy".
