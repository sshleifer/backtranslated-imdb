Seriously, I'm all for romantic comedy movies and I'll suck in Miss Coniginality easily like Goodfellas ... but this movie? This does not make sense! I am not even talking about suspending dissatisfaction with disbelief. Why does her family live in England? Or, at least, why not have a British accent? She is sure her father is suddenly forgiving her for not having been in the past two years. (In this subject, no one holds much agreement about being distant for a long time). And what was he wearing with clothes in a single ceremony? I will not go into the fact that the accompaniment I paid for falls in love with her - and this could not be overcome by making better films. I just say that the characters, the preparation and the plot are not sufficiently embodyed to make a fairly coherent story. Oh, the worst part, in my opinion, is the continued use of the film director for the most unwanted angles on Deborah Messing's nose - I sued the directors if you are! I mean, frankly, I'm all for the women who were what they are, but why, during seven years of loyalty and watching the Grace and Grace show, I never notice how strange her nose is? Oh! Because these producers are nice to her! This film, like my other less favorable film at all, Armageddon, is a mistake filmmakers, not actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with writer, director and best producer. <br /> <br /> This easily gets my vote as one of the worst films I've ever wasted. I'm happy because a friend introduced me to their DVD, so all I waste is time. If there is a way to make this review stars zero, I would do it.
