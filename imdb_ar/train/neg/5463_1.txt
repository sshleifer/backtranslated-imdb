I've seen Arthur (the TV series and books) for years and was not very fond of the show. (If you love this cartoon, sorry if I spoil it for you, but that's what I actually think). Many people were impressed, but I was not. <br /> <br /> The characters of schoolchildren were fighting all the time (especially Arther and DW), and they were nice to each other frequently, but I was gradually tired of Arthur's complaining attitude to everyone and his sister DW (however the spelling was spelled out) DW ADHD (or ADD) - like Arthur's four-year-old sister who was sometimes demanding (this could be Arthur's reason for Arthur's friends, annoyed by her routine, like her imaginary friend and stuffed animal group, etc.) act like teenagers Instead of what they were in Arthur's books, the parents, well, did not care much. <br /> <br /> The greatest cartoon was the modern life of Rocco, not Arthur (no crime).
