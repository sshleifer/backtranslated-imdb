Obviously he has some talent attached, Maria Belo is always wonderful. But this is just a dismal waste of time, portraying each character as someone who hates and exploits so someone can produce a movie of an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they get it out of their systems. Unfortunately for the public, there are no insights, no sensitivity, no context, and no humanity. All this will be fine, but he has no humor, no horror, no context and nothing to build up to say about the story that you are trying to narrate. Speak bad things, you sit and watch them, you do not care, what about it? 99% of the time, the phrase "based on a true story" constitutes an inadvertent warning to the public. This means that the director and scriptwriter are lazy and charmed by some of the events they have heard about somewhere, so they throw them on the screen and expect the "real" nature of the story to make the public feel something without the filmmakers having to work. I hope they have a great time making this film. Stinks on ice.
