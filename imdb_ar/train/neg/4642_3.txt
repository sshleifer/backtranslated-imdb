I saw "Rachel's Attic", believing I would be on an enjoyable trip. However, it was not. Visceral, yes, but enjoyable? That would be big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (for a very short time) as one of the characters of the disgraceful film. How Mr. Hansen ever attracted to this work, I will never know. The idea of ​​the story is interesting but poorly implemented. The trend is pedestrian and middle representation. The only thing that is worse, is the special effects. YIKES !!! I have seen better effects in a school play. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time to change your career ... I hear they're hiring Mel's Diner! There are very few Inde movies that have been produced well from Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of these films.
