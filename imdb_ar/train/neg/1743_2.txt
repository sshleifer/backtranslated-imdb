Unlike its title, this film does not offer any seasoning, thus subjecting the audience to a tasteless dish. All Humor's film is forced, staged, mechanically staged, and recalls the Pakistani play available on video, including behaviors. Everyone screams and yells and does strange things for no reason. The hypothesis seems interesting because it is a direct elevator from Boeing Boeing in Hollywood. John Abraham, who is very natural in almost all of his films, is quite competent here. If we keep the morality factor aside, the strange events seem trite. Kumar and Parish Rawal, two experienced war veterans, are trying hard to elevate the film by being natural but to no avail. At least, the figures of three girls should be contradictory in order to bring some interesting elements. Unfortunately, all of these people appear without brains. And bimbomed bimbomed (3Bs) who speak, act and even shout in a very similar way. The main flaw in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his own house, pretending they would not know each other? To do some sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways, so a lot of dramas do not waste anything easily, but certainly, great meat and tempting promotions always show a lot of great introductory films. Now for those who call it situational comedy, I call it pathetic taste. The sense of humor in the cinema audience will certainly end and damage to the extent that connects them with a kind of sadistic, strange and exciting humor, where they do not laugh at the characters who laugh at them but on themselves and themselves. The frustrations that seem to have become so meaningless that we laugh to bear such things?
