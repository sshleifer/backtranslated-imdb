Following the successful re-run of Gilligan's Island TV, a number of television films were produced in 1980s reunions of classic shows. Most of these films completely missed the boat as much as the humor that made it very special. The MUNSTERS Revenge is one of the most disappointing because it fits in with the comedy genre of Laurel and Hardy that was not already in the original series. Yvonne de Carlo, the comedian's leading comedy actress, is lost completely - she has less time here in this 90-minute film than in any single 30-minute episode. Since the roles of Eddie and Marilyn in this film are nothing more than a veil, what is the purpose of making them younger and redrafting them? With little rewriting, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although the sight of some nervous relatives of Munsters was a nice touch, I did not enjoy Mr. Caesar as a crazy world, mainly because there are too many of them and there are not enough exploited monsters (ironically, 1981, the old partner of Caesar). The comedy, Imogene Coca, was misrepresented in a large part of a television film "Reuniting Beverly Hills." Another strange piece that can not be explained at the beginning of the film was the Munster family as wax characters at the local Wax Museum Why would they be there when they were supposed to be a "typical" American family (though This was the last project for the MÃ¼nsters in which the original actors appeared in their roles, and there was a bad revival of the series in the late 1980s with a whole new team and a television film in the 1990s showed DiCarlo, Louis and Brist Patrick in the roles of family food veil.
