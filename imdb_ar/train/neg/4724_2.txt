This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw him in the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. The manager did not know anything about John Lennon but he said a lot in the premiere. This is a drama, but people were laughing all the time the movie was fun. This is never a good sign. The only blessings that were provided were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as classmates in Levin's room were funny while taking the rest of the film itself seriously. The cheesy projection of the Beatles' lyrics was just ridiculous. The soundtrack was excellent, and probably the best part of the film. Unless you are one of those madness Dominique Monaghan crazy fans, do not care about this.
