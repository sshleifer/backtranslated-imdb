First, I would say that I loved the animal farm book. I read it with my ninth grade and it was fantastic. We also decided that watching the movie would be helpful. The film was very disappointing for me. The film cuts off some characters and misses a lot of key points in the book. He skips a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If someone watches this movie without reading the book for the first time, you'll be puzzled by it. The most frustrating thing in this film for me was the end. The end in the book was the strongest, and in the film, they changed it! The pigs and men were supposed to be in alliance and kind of "fusion" together, but instead, making the film seem to be animals would rebel against the pigs. Bottom line, I do not think this film has captured the true meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
