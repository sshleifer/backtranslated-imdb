This movie is a total dog. I found myself exhausted to find anything I laughed at so that I did not feel I was wasting my money completely - and my time. Writing in this movie is very awesome. It is shameful that it does not relate to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They had to save money to get representatives on the D list like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money running the script was true. Even Gary Coleman was not used properly for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering about the goal of most of the plot - including sub plots. After watching this film, I had the impression that the producers were hoping to pick up a kind of napolite-like humor with dynamite, where it did not match lines and delivery. Unfortunately, this film failed to provide fonts, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
