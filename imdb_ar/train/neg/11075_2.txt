Once, there was a science fiction writer named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy" about a man who discovers an amazing mysterious insulin race on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to loot his grave before his body cools. This is the book they got from the idea of ​​Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a rude rending of "Little Fuzzy" I wonder why I'm the only one I noticed at all? <br /> But do not take my words for it. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
