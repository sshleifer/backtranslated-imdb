The movie "cult" is often referred to as movies that are still sold or sold in the format of a home movie, more than a generation after it was first released. Superchick, first released in 1973, now comes in this category. His state of worship is largely due to the constant attention paid by women who regard it as an early and effective female film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of "Superwoman", Superchick is not a cartoonist but a young lady of high efficiency who acts as an air host - a career option that was considered in the 1970s one of the most elegant elegance of any girl , Which can also mimic the traditional goat who has a wife at each port. As she holds the black belt in karate, she is in a position to make it very clear that she is very happy with her single existence and that she does not belong in any way to any of her large group of male fans. This film is a comedy of situations that avoid the short-term appeal in general to the outright masquerade. Its appeal to feminists is rising at its peak in which our heroines use their karate abilities to avoid hijacking and rescue all other passengers on board from a possible fate. To make sure that this movie will appeal to men as well as to their partners, the manager has wisely ensured that it is sprayed freely with eye candy. <br /> <br /> People who are not very critical and want superlative love can enjoy it. Very light easy to watch comedy that will soon forget after viewing. From forgetfulness to the extent that they may find it both enjoyable if they are seen again within a year; although old, it may retain its status as a cult idol for some time in the future. However, dialogue and representation will make it difficult to give this film a rating exceeding 4/10.
