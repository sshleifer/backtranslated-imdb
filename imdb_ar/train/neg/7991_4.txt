Draw the story of numbers and the average representation preserved by some original colors - and for a few really wonderful moments and felt deeply. It effectively embodies the girl's delicate transition to adulthood, and deals sensitively and creatively with the cultural conflict experienced by the main family. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this microbial is imprisoned from a good film in a film with no purpose and adult plot twisted to merge religious conflict, the conflict over the road construction project, the sexual life of secondary characters and even trilogy, mysterious man living in the forest, Of racist rioters, at least three different carnivals, the complexities of local church politics, on and on and on. All this does not even include the actual central conspiracy, which concerns only the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point in their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that everything was supposed to happen during one summer (and that a lot of movies were accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is melodramatic, every point plot is predictable, The main life changing events are then forgotten after about 10 minutes ... and some of these events are very disturbing. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrific crime (in a fully predictable "evolution") and is therefore completely tolerated and completely ignored since then. Similarly, a secondary personality is only offered to die after a few minutes and provide another "evolution". Everything is completely mechanical, until the end, neatly connecting all the loose limbs (not all of them, just those that the film thinks about.)
