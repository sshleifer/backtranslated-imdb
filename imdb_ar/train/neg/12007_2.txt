It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani managed to attract people to the stage until the day of release. I mean ..... See the cast here, the promotion is fantastic, the songs are good enough and the trailers are good. This makes it a full house on the first day, but only when people go and see the movie realize that there is no way to recover their money. A full house on the first day, the film will end next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by "Love Actually" is what they say, did not manage to deal with the cast well. They tried to put big stars but ended up being unable to achieve average performance by anyone. The stories are hollow and dazzling, so the public can communicate with any one of them. It is a great disappointment to all those who love big stars or in this regard Nikhil Advani after his great success "Kal Ho Na Ho".
