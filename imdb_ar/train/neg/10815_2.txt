I love the book "Jane Eyre" and I have seen many versions of it. All have strong points and their mistakes. However, this was one of the worst I've ever seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Ginsburg (Jane) was widely accepted and certainly looked easy, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester had seen. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had less affection than Jane, if possible. How can two bleak people fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not catch my attention. Zeffrelli may be asleep during production. <br /> <br /> The version of Timothy Dalton (very handsome to Mr. Rochester!) is more faithful to the book, but Caran Hinds plays the ideal Mr. Rochester. In the 1997 version of A / E (which is not fully applicable to this book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this film: Geraldine Chaplin was perfect in her role.
