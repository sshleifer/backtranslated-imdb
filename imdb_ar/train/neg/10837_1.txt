I can not tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the least interesting, the plot does not exist. So after waiting to see how the life of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past two hours and half have led to some important end, what do we get ??? A storm of frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the basic theme, but first and foremost, it was presented without any decision; secondly, it will be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (important part of the population) or Charles Fort Larger). As a fairly good-looking person, I thought this film was a weak tradition immersed in the Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> <br /> ... Well anything to be honest
