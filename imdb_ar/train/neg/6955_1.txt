He failed to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be a science fiction). It's really just "Let's see what soap is doing in a practical way this week," Oh, Cylons shares through the memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The "babe" Cylon that keeps nailing the other guy is very lame, so obviously T & A has been added to the show. Every time I pop out I'm surprised that the WTF is supposed to last. Do not even try to pierce me around the "story bows". <br /> <br /> It's a soap opera with some CGI. This is not a scientific imagination, regardless of the original hypothesis. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything that has been set up to be. If you like the vibrant, dodgy, jumping and ambiguous camera business, this offer may be right for you. Since it seems that obsessed people are interested in this presentation, it is a clear indication that the views of the phonetic mums have changed from TNG in Picard.
