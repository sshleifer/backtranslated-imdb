I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushko, but she only has a smaller part of it, and her character is not very likable. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is very beautiful and very exciting to look around the film. This really is only a display of its appearance and talent. It does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself, on the face of it, is meaningless. After a car accident, some friends may have died, but they continued to live in their previous lives, while all kinds of mysterious things occur. Some bad guys chase them, but we do not really know who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are). The final scenes look particularly ambitious in films, but I can not get anything coherent. The opening scene, where the bad guys (wearing strange masks) cut the wrist of the blonde girl and collect some of her blood has not been explained or followed up. Unless the bad guys are supposed to represent the surgeons who try to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead ... but no, this does not seem to work. The bad guys are the bad guys only. They really just messed up a story that was probably interesting. In a supernatural story about death, love and sacrifice, who needs hell for the bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
