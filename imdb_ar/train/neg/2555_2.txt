This film is probably one of the most horrible horror I have ever seen. The length was not long enough to cover a good story. The way the adoptive parents died was just ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies from falling into the bathroom after stumbling on a moving figure, and shot the father by a police officer? I can see where some originality may have been what they were going to, but it could have been better. Also, it made me all that cheese I wanted to press stop before it ended. After hearing all Lucy's name and knowing it was Lucifer, I wanted to shut up. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It is a male name. Should be given to male personality. All in all, the film was a joke, and he could have used a better plot.
