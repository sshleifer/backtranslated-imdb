When you go to an outdoor cinema under the Greek summer night, you usually do not care about the content of the movie! Edison started really good with some good efforts of singers who want to be actors and Morgan Freeman again made a wonderful but ... (In the film, there is usually a good start to attract the audience, do it, and a little boring after filling the story in the middle of the film Which revolves around characters and other work done, the third part is a really good thing so you can remember the movie ...) When you see 30 elite police officers (filled with weapons that can demolish a building), shooting a man standing behind a car, Hit him even once while killing everyone (but 3), and then the man goes out the flame launcher (to kill the rest 3), you give birth The Greek summer Star-filled sky is a very good way to distract attention through such a movie!
