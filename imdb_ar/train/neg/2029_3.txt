I do not see enough TV programs to understand the appeal of "show me money", but I suppose it carries some appeal to the lax masses. Ostensibly offering a contest, offering the contestants huge amounts of money to answer some simple questions. However, their competition elements play a small role in the proceedings, which I find to be rather complicated. For example, before answering a question, the contestant chooses the question to ask by choosing from random options A, B or C. Does this serve any other purpose than slow down the game? It will be much quicker to start with the word "A". Contestants can ask questions, but they must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the contestant is asked to "lock" the answer - another delay tactic. The next task of the contestant is to name a woman from about ten dancers back and forth in cages, revealing a card that indicates how important the question is. The correct answer adds the card number in dollars to the total rider's rider; This time-consuming move has some value for entertainment, as it allows the public to take a closer look at the amazing dancers and dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant is reminded that the unlucky choice of "Killer Card" will end the game immediately. This naturally makes the race racer cause more delays as the nervous rider thinks of a sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the prospect of a sudden disaster is the public's main appeal at the show. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the entire process slowed much more through a lot of empty joking between host William Schattner, along with the occasional routines by dancers in the crate. All these delays disappear so much time that it is possible for the masses to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute JEOPARDY episode typically takes up to 60 questions. During the first 30 minutes of SMTM I saw, I got only six questions (many of them related to other TV programs). This show will not see anyone in his right mind because it is fun to play with him by answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons for viewing the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how the contestant responds because he is about to win a million dollars, just to lose everything with one shot. <br /> <br /> B. To look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dances. <br /> <br /> C. To enjoy the glittering William Schattner brawl. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not in the camera long enough to justify suffering within an hour of this show.
