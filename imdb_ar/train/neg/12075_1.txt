This Hamlet made for one of the most boring MST3000 rings ever. I am not a Shakespeare fan, but I do not think he ever intended to be slow slow pace. It is also one of the hardest films to be found because of the large number of Hamlets listed. As I said though this is a very boring one. It's black and white, slow speed, and there is a simple scene. All actors are also named so they do not help you. This is the version MST 3000 that I can not see in one session, where the man who plays Hamlet says his lines can make anyone sleep.
