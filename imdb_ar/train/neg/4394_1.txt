John Goodman's program was terrible, but this thing simply stinks. The only and only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as a frost. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has been plagued by childhood rebellious memories but has never gained any great sense of perspective in the intervening years. The paranoia governs the dark world inhabited by these characters. Everyone is unpleasant, and without reason. The plot is predictable but the supply flows from an inexplicable and unrelated scene to another scene in a meaningless way and there is no pleasure in watching it. The worst thing is that no one in the production crew is ever seen at all!
