This was probably the worst film I have ever seen !! It was stupid that there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous !! I have never seen such a bad behavior in my life! The only good part about the film was all the satirical actors (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people were thinking when they made this movie !! I did not want to end it all because you got to that point in the movie where all the players are sitting in bed. I mean it was kind of like pornographic patients and twisted childish! I would recommend anyone who heard this movie and was interested in watching it forget and find another movie to watch it! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was a waste of time in my opinion.
