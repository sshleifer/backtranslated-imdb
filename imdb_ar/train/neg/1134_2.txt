As Danny, I'm proud of a handful of good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. It is, however, a shame that a significant increase in quality leads to the loss of criticism by most critics of Danish films. In fact, it was so bad that I no longer trusted any reviews of Danish films, and I had stopped seeing them in the theaters. <br /> <br /> I know it's a mistake to stop this unfortunate development against any single movie, so let me emphasize that Villa Paranoya will be a terrible film under any circumstances. The fact that critics ridiculed her has added more force to my feelings of disappointment than the Danish film. Moreover, waiting for it to be released on a DVD was not very useful in the face of the unwavering sense of waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Eric Klausen is an ingenious director of his talent for social realism in Copenhagen settings. I particularly enjoyed "De Frigjorte" (1993). He is usually funny as an actor, although he generally plays the same role in all his films, a working-class movie falls on his luck, partly because he is a slop but mostly because of society, and who is remaking himself by doing something good to his society. <br /> <br /> This is the first problem in "Villa Paranoia"; Klausen describes himself as a chicken farmer, a break from the base he has never been able to make credible. <br /> <br /> However, it is much worse that the film makes shifts and turns and breaks all the rules on how to tell the story to make the audience understand what is going on. For example, the movie opens with a very sad attempt to visualize the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and poor camera work. After that, she tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the need to throw herself out of a bridge. This is one of the symptoms of the entire film; there is no motive or no motive for the actions of the characters, and Klausen resort to the lowest forms of communication whatever the motive: to tell instead of the show. So, at some point, you have a person talking loudly to an alleged killer about how he feels, because the script will not allow him to act with his feelings; later, the sound is suddenly introduced, and perhaps a subsequent idea, to convey the feelings that may remain Unknown to the public because of the director's inefficiency. Fortunately, at this point almost an hour is almost interested in any of the characters, not to mention the alleged story. <br /> <br /> The acting, which was a problem in Klausen's films, can be repeated in one sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentensen, whose only claim of stardom as a rival to the older brother, is no worse than many actors The ugly team. <br /> <br /> I give this 2 out of 10 ratings.
