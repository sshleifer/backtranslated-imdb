As we all know, Hollywood enjoys changing historical events for its enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood-themed movies. For example, bank thieves did not return to the bank when they started shooting at LAPD, but in the film we see them going back inside twice! Another example is the number of Los Angeles police officers who were shot near the end of the film, which is far from the truth! But of course Hollywood must have a good bloody end to add more blood and courage. Some of the actors have been combined and many key actors have played many different people, but that's what Hollywood has always done. Why do you complain? I think the only sad part is that I watched some one-hour documentaries about shootings in North Hollywood on TLC that were much better than this!
