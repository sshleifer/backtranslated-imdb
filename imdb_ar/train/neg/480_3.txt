2 Star of CAI FRANCIS - It's great! It is not worth the terrible trip that Warner Bros. threw! <br /> <br /> The two-pronged premise on which this film is based is absurd and extremely unreasonable. Kai is a little girl in town and a mother yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a great actress comes to the city and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband she will go to the movies. Rafiq Baal of the mother of an insect in Baal's ear puts Kai to be honest, and he is looking for her. He found her with the actor in the hotel (they only talk!) As he rushes the man who falls over the railing, faces first face in a pond (lake?), And dies. The judge tells the jury that if the man is determined to die * before his head goes into the water, they must find the culprits in the first-degree murder. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think hitting a man in a fit of rage would count on murder or murder at most 2, not the first murder ... Give me a break! But the plot requires him to be convicted of murder so that he can be sent to jail Life, whatever it is.) <br /> <br /> 2) Baal's lawyer, after conviction and judgment, tells Kay that all this is wrong. The reason for this is that if she does not go to the actor's room, her husband will not have to chase her down and kill the man. He tells her that she is guilty, not her husband, and blushes and agrees. What. The. hell?!?!?! The rest of the film revolves around Kai's attempt to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband out of prison and correct the mistake she committed by causing the murder of the exorcist in the first place. <br /> <br /> I can not continue this review. The film was very painful. Four years ago, in the days before the code, you have not caught Kai and he plays like that monkey! In true Cay Francis fashion, though, she did her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable personality. I give her a lot of credit to try to breathe some life and credibility for this role is no doubt. This personality was far removed from Kai's roles that were introduced into the pre-code and true enthusiasm of Kai Francis life. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this technique! There are much better Francis Kai cars out there! (Through personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Joel Robbery; also good for Dr. Monica and One Way Passage.) I'm sure there are other fantastic clicks from Kai too, but I just mentioned those that "I've seen and can recommend. )
