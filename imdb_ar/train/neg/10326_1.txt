Canadian television once again beats itself and creates another show that will not be seen after its first show. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember the comic was supposed to trigger a reaction in which we would laugh. How funny is it to overcome the stereotype of all white people who believe that all Muslims are terrorists? Well, maybe just one joke to stick to the crowd. But not 30 minutes. Call it hit a dead horse. So SNL was known to give up after a commercial downtime. <br /> <br /> Also, let's see some discrepancy in these texts. Are they or are they not able to offer sandwiches the option to break up in Ramadan? When does Ramadan start? Ohhhhh This is the winning stuff of Amy here. <br /> <br /> The characters! What are the characters ?! They are all cardboard scraps without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one case to another. This is the comedy point of the situation. We need strong, exciting and dynamic characters to be constantly attracted to our TV every week. We have to take care of these figures to worry about any problem they will have next week. If I have never seen these characters, it will be very soon. Luckily I can not remember any of their names (note to CBC - this is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> The behavior is very nice. It's a problem casting more than actors. None of these people embodies the personalities they play. They seem to be acting on their side as if they were working in a movie of the week. The sitcom requires actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - they become separate from the character they portray. Watch any American comic play and see how easy it is to define characters. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to be dealing with this project as if it could serve as a platform for bigger and better things rather than being a big figure in the age they will be filming over the next eight years. This level of disinterest in the characters shows the project. But to be honest, taking into account the concept of lame and horrible writing, there is not much that actors should do but say their lines and try not to collide with any furniture. As one commentator puts it, this looks like a television movie, not a comic. <br /> <br /> Direction or lack of! What can I say, Canada has a lot of talent, see what comedy channel do with puppets who kill and punch. Look at Trailer Park Boys (not the movie caused by the big helium dog). Look at any US offer to learn about the potential of our talent, as many of our stars go to find decent work. <br /> <br /> Granting credit to CBC, they really know how to build publicity for an inappropriate event. . Remember "one"? No - well, do not even try to figure out the names of the characters in this show, so be sure to walk in the way of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let us all hope for the whole ACTRA strike so none of this is coming out of Sayeb for a long time.
