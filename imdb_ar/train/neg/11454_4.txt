So I had low expectations for this movie to begin with, but failed to meet even those. While there were some funny parts, there were even one or two laughing at the loud parts, but this film did not go far beyond what I call good. The nicest jokes were not expected and very quickly, we left sitting there "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were a few jokes that only lasted on and on. The part where the mountain is falling has made me arrogant. Also, the editing was really lacking. There have been some bad shifts in the scene, but that seems to be the method at present. He made me laugh, but I will not see him again, and I am very happy that I waited for him to hire him. Give her a chance, you may enjoy her, but do not think you are in anything like the 40 year old Virgin or Superbad.
