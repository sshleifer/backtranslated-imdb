Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Shield, the fifth installment in the Dream nightmare series on Avenue Walk and the worst sequel at all in this series, is worse than the Nightmare on the Street of the Id 2. You were lucky enough to get a nightmare on the Street of the Deer DVD was set on My birthday and I saw all the results. The child's dream was the worst undoubtedly, I was also surprised by what they were doing well in another supplement. But I think they only lost magic, and the story was just a joke and I was not satisfied with where I went. Alice is no more troublesome, she is not Nancy or Kirsten, so carrying it alone does not work for me. Freddie also loses his fear, it was just a bit silly. <br /> <br /> Alice returned carrying a child, and she was not the happiest of her life. But Freddy also came back and will not have much light because she easily defeated him in the fourth film. But anyway, her baby wants to be born again in the world. Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well, this is a nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Dream is investigating, and Alice will soon discover how Freddy's childhood was, and perhaps this is the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> Nightmare on Elm Street: The Baby's Dream is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone can be happy with this sequel. The story was really silly, I mean it could have worked, but again it was done wrong. I know that if you are looking to see the consequences of the Nightmare series in the Elm Street series, you should watch them, but I do not really recommend it, it is not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> </ 3>
