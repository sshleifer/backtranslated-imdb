Well, Chuck Norris somehow found a way to produce this sequel. I have one question why? Who read this text and said "The sound is wonderful! Original!" This film is a crap again that I will not distort my toilet intestine. Of course, it's another story, followed by MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so on. Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can resemble America from some bad guys. He does not even need a gun most of the time. It's stupid national terms that spoil the mind. Big surprise that the only person who will manage this Norris movie is Eric Chuck's son. Eric Norris mainly worked on all his father's films and television shows. Does not this hit anyone as proof that he does not have a directing talent? After that, the same people are directed as before in the same stories as before ... The only difference is the names of the characters. If this is supposed to make me patriotic and delightful for the United States of America, our country is in a much worse situation than I had imagined. Hopefully this is the nail in Chuck Norris' representative coffin.
