Elizabeth Rumm was the weakest actress in both "Law and Security" and "Ada" and her actions are worse here. Her attempts at Texas dialect are amateur and unrealistic. She can not summon the intense feelings needed to play or the mother of the kidnapped child; sometimes when her daughter is missing, she can only disturb you vaguely, as if she can not remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is a real important story, so it's very bad that the horrible acting lead actress spends a lot on the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they can not beat the Rum's tendency to just put a particularly thick tradition of the South Pose whenever actual acting is required.
