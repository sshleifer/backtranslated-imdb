Well, I think I have to be the one who says "Emperor is not wearing clothes." When I saw this show included in PBS last night I was optimistic and scared. I loved "Morse" (even if I went to buy the whole DVD set) and I felt that, while I always loved Kevin Whyely's Sgt. Lewis's character, the show was John Zoe, period! After watching the new Inspector Lewis (as mentioned here), I am more convinced than ever that I was right ... What is good (although it sounds awful (both suffer from bad aging and fat too), but simply He does not have the charisma to perform the show as the ice did. <br /> <br /> And for Fox's "Sidekick", well ... maybe the reviewers here from England could understand what he was saying, but for the sake of which nobody could often. <br /> <br /> For Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I am sorry to say that they should leave Morse in peace.
