One of the reviewers described this film as "pure visual joy", and I wonder if he / she saw the same movie that I saw. The "high art" had to have the most frustrating interior design since "Seven". One can forgive Shady and Mitchell almost for cliches going to bed and breakfast for the first time. Of course, before you do that, one has to watch opium poppy-rides that are apparently not paid for, but they can somehow support the thriving drug habit. Not to mention the icy stars of those familiar, friendly / friendly movie genres at first, which are well aware that they will come up sometime during the next hundred minutes or so. The film also mentions that Shady has retired from professional photography for 10 years now. What did you do, retired at the age of twenty?
