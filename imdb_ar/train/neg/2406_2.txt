From the perspective of Harry Allen Towers comes another piece of film sludge. Presumably based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only resemblance to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it happens in Africa (though Africa has dinosaurs - used by bold adventurers in towing their boats!), Some characters with the same names . <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee, and John Colico) hunt for treasure, armed only with a medal, and end up exactly where the treasure is, just by chance. On the way, they meet with a variety of very savage monsters, pick up a French chef, and Macalom has an affair with the queen of Venice. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, it's hustle. That's the only reason he made me not give it 1.
