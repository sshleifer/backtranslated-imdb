No way this movie is as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it was not funny. It was not possible to stick to one kind of comedy - jumping from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to a romantic, to a young man who recorded heavily, to a slap, to the "loser" (comedy) types. Despite having some funny jerky moments (falling down the hill), no one was very funny or wonderful in any way. Schindler's list was more entertaining (and felt shorter). She never knew whether Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, leaving college, or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spike, in her worst selection of roles. Poor Ian Makshan, serious actor if I only had one label, gets crap to read in camera. The story continues and is fully predictable to the end (there are no spoilers here if Adam Samberg wants to see it). Do not spend any money spent watching this movie, Lorne Michaels may get a tip and start producing high-quality movies (yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are good).
