Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror films. I have never seen them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw this movie was that my friend and friends wanted to see him Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I have not seen "Happy Feet", but I'm sure it's better than ... this movie? Anyway, we did not expect it to be good ... we just went for a laugh. Cool with me ... I have a problem breaking the film for other people in the theater, but because it was just couples talking and going out, it was not important. <br /> <br /> Fifteen minutes later, other people left to sneak into Borat, a movie I would gladly see again. The film was not scary, it was not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was boring. It was not as terrible as the Gen Geneses terrible, it was terrible like ... not amusing at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it seems that the problem of the horror industry these days is that you can have a boring PG-13 horror and not scary, or you can get R horror film terrible either too bloody or disgusting for people . <br /> <br /> Do you want the PG-13 horror you suck but funny? See "Hatred". Avoid this movie like a plague ... because it may lead to your death literally. <br /> <br /> 0/10
