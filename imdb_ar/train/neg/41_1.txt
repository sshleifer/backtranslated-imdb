How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? When you can not stop laughing about it of course! The plot was well covered by other reviewers, so I'll add a few things about the joy of it all. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have placed the site in South America, others in Africa, I think was in some random island in the Pacific Ocean. Where exactly this happens, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is compatible with a couple of black women and some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa knocks the drums ... The Devil of God is a big black man who has a terrible state of pink eyes. <br /> <br /> One of the "most horrifying moments" in the film is when, "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered with what appears to be an orange substance I suppose is blood, and begins screaming for several minutes. (This is really funny), then drops his partner's head in the ground and "Pablito" hits him a bit because I suppose he is "wriggling" and blushing the eyes already ... <br /> <br /> But, of course, then "disappear" when you realize that The eyes have moved because the movie is so bad ... <br /> <br /> I did not laugh like that in a break, and I definitely recommend this movie on a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you do not have anything to do ... A beer case and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you are looking for a horror film or real gore, though ... do not bother.
