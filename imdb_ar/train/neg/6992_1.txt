The plot revolves around a nurse, Anna, who is caught in a state of chaos all over the world where the zombie begins to eat meat to rise up and take over the world and attack neighborhoods. She escapes to the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this film does not deserve to be called horror. It's not exciting, it's ridiculous. Even Flintstone, Kokla, Fran and Oiles will give you more excitement. It's like watching a group of blood-thirsty drunkards and not having access to a mall for more wines. Heroes who have locked themselves inside the mall to avoid being eaten by outsiders are no better. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they only give the impression that they are mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it!
