Because others have encountered a problem in summarizing the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to clean them up. <br /> <br /> Due to the film's low budget, the creature's design was very good. It's really nice to see a direct horror movie of the video that is not being defeated using the awesome CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of a digital film is very popular in places, and is most noticeable in well lit white resort halls. <br /> <br /> - The ironic lighting design touches parts of this film, so as not to say anything about the differences over time. I understand that the manager may have been trying to simulate dementia, and for this to be effective, a steady flow of time must be created. As it is, it seems just amateurish. <br /> <br /> - The volatility of the charts has been numerous but predictable. I had no doubt in my mind about the identity of the cultures that had been devised, nor the fact that there was some kind of good development of evil evil that would eventually prevail. <br /> <br /> - This may sound like flickering, but the characters in this film fail reliably to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, regulatory committees will be all over the mental health center that has unilaterally announced the death of the patient and the employee caused by cardiac arrest. Why is the main psychiatrist able to perform autopsies? Why was not the point of conspiracy made of these impressive qualifications, or the introduction of his strange choice of religion? What is the background? What is supposed to make us care about anyone in this? Equally important, who taught in his mind the correct introduction of the place, saw everything was very wrong with him, and then concluded that it was still a good place to follow the residence? This film did not respect his characters enough to give them the benefit of doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
