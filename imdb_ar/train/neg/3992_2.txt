Director Spike Lee is famous for making films that refer to racism. In many films, such as "Do The Right Thing", most white people are all racist and beastly. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject, where racism is the whole issue again. <br /> <br /> However, what he does to me is to show his intolerance against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the world of cinema. If I or anyone else produced this kind of bias against another group you would be disgusted, but Christians? Hey, it's an "open season" for them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, revered in this film, shoots his son and then puts the flaming pistol above his sacred book. Add another close-up if you miss the opportunity. Hey, dear reader, here's another reader of the Bible and look for something like it! He does this to me in every film he makes. <br /> <br /> The same hatred appears when dealing with race relations. Who can argue in portraying racism as something evil? However, he perpetuates me in this film as he did in his other films. His clear passions towards whites do not help in this position. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: never "do the right thing" and leave your biases in the closet. Better yet, "bypass" it. <br /> <br /> This is very bad because the subject could have been made for a thought-provoking film if it had been objectively and intelligently.
