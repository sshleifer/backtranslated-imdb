This film is a car of Sean Connery and Melissa. The crappy offerings are usually special by Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris. Conrey is wrong at the Harvard Academy. The film gets worse as it continues. It is a third-rate puzzle that becomes very open at the time of its decay. The film wastes an excellent support team. George Plimpton also appeared in a secondary role to add some appeal to Connery during the discussion on the death penalty. Violence and Air Pepper Mystery / Mystery Class III is manipulated to the highest degree. Scripting and direction are very poor. Charisma Connery and screen attendance is the only virtue in the film. Manipulative, violent, and silly. 2/10 avoid it.
