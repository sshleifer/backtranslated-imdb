Many people like to point to this television movie when they argue with huge hordes of Hanks-philes that Tom actually did crazy movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was fantastic, but that's another story). The film focuses on Dungeons and Dungeons, a game that finally drives young people into the hallucinatory madness. The story in the early 1980s, focusing on the imminent threat to our youth represented by evil role playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to consider "labyrinths and monsters" as a turning point in "Everything Happened to Chris Makepeace?" a story. We all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unhappy Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave us all a huge thrill by beating the crap from Matt Dillon. Few argue (especially those who have read "dynamite!" Regularly) that great things were in place. <br /> <br /> Then Rona came dry. The line between bad representation and bad writing is very poor, so I leave it to you to determine the flaw in the performance of Makepeace in this matter. All I know is that the last major release I saw was "Vamp", which was in 1986. It had a small role as the Sean Penn brothers in "Falcon and the Snowman", but by then the Brat Pack was transferred to others with more hair Tight and shiny appeal. <br /> <br /> In a good conscience I can not recommend this film. Just see him to see Chris Macpis, the youngest and most perfect, before Rona Jaffe enjoys his spirit.
