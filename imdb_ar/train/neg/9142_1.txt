I watched this after I heard about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you have read all the negative comments here, you will not be able to understand how terrible this movie actually is, although it must be one of the funniest things I have ever seen! You did not bother to post a comment here before, but this piece of crap justifies it really. <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot is silly and meaningless. The brother of the main character (either Ben or Arthur, I forget which, frankly not clear) wants to stop gay marriage by killing everyone on the horizon - because homosexuality is repugnant to Christians, but mass murder does not seem to be. Then there are some other crap that has been thrown in one of the wives of the ex-gay couple trying to force him to remarry at gunpoint. This does not lead to anything, but it provides us with more fun dialogue lines in the entire "film" - "I do not understand? You do not understand! That makes sense!". A wonderful. <br /> <br /> Then there's acting, which is just awful. It must be seen as believed. My personal favorite is the seemingly invisible civil rights lawyer, who clearly reads her lines about something, yet is still able to spoil her. He said enough. Gay couple can not be less convincing. There is a mysterious and totally charming guy, and his friend who looks like that little guy of cartoon paste in pesto ads. Obesity only. And less talent. <br /> <br /> The movie was filmed by someone unable to carry the camera up remotely, and the number of errors around is amazing. Everything goes off with the chubby main man in bed with a pair of shoes. Yeah. <br /> <br /> But anyway, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the priceless moments of comedy that the film offers. <br /> <br /> - When the chubby man lights the church in the fire and then acts like a six-year-old girl across the parking lot to escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Moderate! There is no idea about her relationship with the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they do not know her, but she shows up in several scenes though. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The lawyer is stuffed. I have already mentioned it, but it is very funny and deserves another male. <br /> <br /> - Dinner of the wicked brothers from the biscuits he was hosting for his guests. <br /> <br /> - Anti-Fool's Brother is a gay dose. <br /> <br /> - The evil cat's cat. <br /> <br /> - The end, which I will not give up because it must be seen as honest. I warn you though, make sure you do not eat at that time! The tub of the main personal lard / director / producer gets naked. It's foul. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally is the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, there is nothing good about this excuse for a movie, but the director's exit director even turns the opening credits into a joke by typing his own name about 15 times.
