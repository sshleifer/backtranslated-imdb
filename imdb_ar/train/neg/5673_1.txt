Quote from Oedpius Rex because it's a tragedy that this movie made up !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I in no way hate Uwe Boll like most people who are powerless on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll films such as Postal and Tunnel Rats are very bad and are therefore amusing. But frankly, this film was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a grade of zero if you could. The story is just crap! Spend four-fifths of the film on the plot construction and then have a medium that is just scenes of terrible terrible killing done tasteless! Finally it ended with a "final flute" which is perfectly acceptable but certainly could have been better than this! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) nor am I against violent movies! I and ** king love violent movies! I liked Saw Movies, Hostel Films, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 Movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, Tarantino, All Sam Peckinpah cannibals and ** king of the Holocaust! but this! OMFG! <br /> <br /> This was tough, sinister, and corrupt! Look at the movies I just mentioned! If you love cannibal love and not this, it must be bad! Oi, do not go all the dark again! You're funny when you're light-hearted, just like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! I felt terrified everywhere after seeing this! <br /> <br /> Do not wait !!!! Avoid it at all!
