I did not want to watch this film because it gave an impression of a very common and predictable film ... but I was also very pleased to discover the surprising film "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" which was surprisingly produced and written by Laurent Terrard "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, believing that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "menonges ..." It is not at all. The script is not bad, but it is not well directed like "Mensonges ...", the actors are not generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as they usually are) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, and I am also frank, I still do not understand how it could be like This nonsense is such a success, even if this choice ... Anyway, the story was probably an excuse to create many intriguing plots, but it is not as good as "Menonges ..." from Tirard though he has also written it, And Saul.
