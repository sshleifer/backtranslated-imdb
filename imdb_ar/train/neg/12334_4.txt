The premise is silly, incredible characters, vulgar dialogue, silly end. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Klein, but watching it in Pepe Le Pew for two hours because the supposed French is not as amusing as it seems. <br /> <br /> For her part, Meg Ryan is once again as fun and wonderful as (Choose What You Want): kewpie doll, baby girl, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the best creature on earth. Nor does it bear the slightest resemblance to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This movie surprises me as an opportunity taken by Laurence Cassdan and Klein's friends for a vacation in Paris and southern France while they were getting the money. So I can not really blame them.
