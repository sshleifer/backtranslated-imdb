Well, the big money machine did it again! Disney benefits with the skill of ethics like me that I feel we must own every video (good or bad) sealed with the Disney title. Why do I still look forward to these "sequences" that make Don Bluth on a bad day that looks like Leonardo da Vinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (actually a bad choice!) Does not one of Disney's most exciting creations deserve at least a written story? Of these three, the latter comes nowhere near the quality of the animation and storytelling that I expect. The music is awful and modern (meaning it will be dated within two years) and adds nothing to the story. Why should everything be updated? As you know, the original caricatures are still common because of their immortality, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Jie, I can not wait to finish for Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky themes, we will get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, if you listen to Disney, remember that we are not all random children here. How about throwing a bone or two on fans who have long been to know the difference between skill and folly?
