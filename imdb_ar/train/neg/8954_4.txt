I had great hopes in this film, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I do not think I would understand the premise of the film if I had not read the book already. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break the bonds of the rule of the victorious government, but the book depicts suffering more comprehensively. Corrupt government officials have a comfortable and almost luxurious life, while the public struggles to get bare necessities to survive. Most people may feel this way towards their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are actually oppressed or oppressed. Orwell's difficulty seems to exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I read the book, but one hears the references to Big Brother, The Thought Police and Newspeak frequently in the media and informal conversation. Many people who use these terms may not realize where the terminology came from. I highly recommend that you read the book.
