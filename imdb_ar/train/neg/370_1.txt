Check Blank is one of the worst films of the 1990s. The plot is completely meaningless. Her tones of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really think that a 12-year-old is a personal assistant to a billionaire who can do everything in this movie, like buying a palace for just $ 300? The idea, not to mention the price of the deal, will only be believed by the more naive viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and do not watch this terrible film.
