First of all, let's start by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clarke should be commended for their association with this leadership. I had to give this one would not let me give it a zero. I want to know how bad this film is? My mother called me from all over the city and said to me, "My son, I've seen the dumbest movie ever." I answered, "Killer tongue huh? Well, I'll give him a chance, I sat in the rest of this movie just because I wrote a column for horror reviews, I beg you, and do not waste time and money. Or even brain cells on this ridiculous piece - run away - away - if you see them on the shelf in Hollywood movies or even your local video store, flip it over and leave it away .... and still want two hours back dang it
