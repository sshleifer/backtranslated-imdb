- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was about non WWF wrestling, so I thought it might be funny. Not so. It's painful to watch. Embarrassed. Any chance for comedy will dispel mercilessly. <br /> <br /> I admit I do not like Black Jack anyway. After this I enclose my mind to think about the good role one has played. The only thing I could get to where he was working was a necessary frustration for John Kozak's character in "high precision". Jack Black is one of those terrible men who do not wear a knockout (like a little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being idiots is not funny. <br /> <br /> It's not just a joke. It's just anger. It's not stupid, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I've heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if that's what I want to do I will not rush to find it on a DVD.
