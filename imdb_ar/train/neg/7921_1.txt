The Corpse Grinders 2 plot is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, while the remainder of the other film is made up of strange aliens. <br /> <br /> I think this movie will be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if anyone has already seen it. The land is not connected, and in many cases (very much), it makes no sense at all. The real wonder here is why this sequel was created in the world for such an unsuccessful and horrific film (but still somewhat better). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy watching horrible movies for a good laugh.
