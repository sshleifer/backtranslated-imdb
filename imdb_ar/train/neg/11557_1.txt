* Soil * It's fake! The whole thing is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, now he is the Lord, his cousin, his brother, his half-brother or something like this that wants the castle and its address for itself. So he is investing this very complex and unnecessary plan at all. Scooby-DOO to push Alan to suicide. Most of the movie is for him picking up redheads and attacking them. He does not kill them. He goes down to sleep and the girl disappears and is believed to have buried them somewhere. If looking at the alleged Evelyn ghost, he could say she was wearing gloves! My God what a waste of time. Do not bother watching it and renting it and if you bought it and you have not seen it yet, sell it. Quickly! Go ahead and get away from THE THE NIGHT EVELYN CUT OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinky CRAP-O-LANTERN.
