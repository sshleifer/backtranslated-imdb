I rarely give less favorable ratings in a show or movie I did not like on the IMDb program, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is terrible, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I did not think if this was an animated series - it was better to think it was this way, but as a live show, the terms "cheesy" and "camp" appear. Including Power Rangers. Five teenagers, spandex multicolored, fight evil using their martial arts skills. Awesome fashion - looks like nothing to remind us of what trackers, field and gymnasts can wear. The acting is disturbing, and the fightography is very bad and thrilling to watch, making Jean-Claude Van Damme, looks just as good as Bruce Lee, who is an understatement in itself. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing; as if they were some version of the Nutcracker, or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are some cartoons that are very martial arts, but they are fun, but they are not cheese that makes them look silly. <br /> <br /> Children appear or not, this is just lame and about to tamper. Although this version is set in America, you may be forgiven for thinking that you can see some of the combat sequences that were not filmed in the United States, but in Japan; and therefore the fighting and "fake" footage were borrowed to some extent from the Japanese version Only to be added to the US version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, keep using the Sentai - Japanese equivalent.
