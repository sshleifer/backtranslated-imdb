I must congratulate the genius who agreed to this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think he's a partner, you can not grab every piece of low-cost amateur nonsense, which you should be the only intention is to get some dollars. <br /> <br /> Photography is bad, I mean bad. Anyone with a camera will get the same result, or better. <br /> <br /> Allows you to represent, say: Do not go to the supermarket in search of representatives. The good guys usually get a certificate or, at least, they have some dreaded experience! Director .. Mr. John Keyes, please find your goal in life, as an outlet you simply absorb. Your steering is bad, the corners are all spoiled (not in a good way), the lines look as if they were read from the toilet paper, and the damn music always appears when it should not and goes out for no apparent reason. And do not go to the writer as well, by the way. Making movies does not look like a show on a cafe, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt in its existence at all. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a pussy shot, you have to shoot this movie back to forgetfulness and wait until something good comes in. Or just find a job at a cafe. You will have less pressure and will provide moviegoers some money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> Voting: 1/10 (my first report)
