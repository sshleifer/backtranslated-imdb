(Outta 5 stars) This film has some great opening credits (a narrator outside the screen warns that filmgoers will get a free burial if they die because of fear of watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull coming out of a quiet place and gathering scary music everywhere) ) But, alas, the film is all the slope from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded palace ... His friends and friends advise that the new lady has a very fragile tendency because of a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time at all, you began to see and hear mysterious things that no one else could do. Her husband assures her that it's all in her mind and ... well, maybe you can see where all this goes. You will have discovered what is going on long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you may have seen the same plot in hundreds of movies and other TV shows (and did it better). To add to the countless movie, most of the movie clips (on many cheap DVD sets) seem to lack some major scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly towards the window ... Go to open it ... You know she'll see something scary ... Then suddenly, the scene is confined to crying in her husband's hands. So what do you see? I think we will never know.
