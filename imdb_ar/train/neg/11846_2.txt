After watching this movie, I complained to the local cinema of the quality of the audio track or whether the cinema sound system may be defective. It is very difficult in the first half of the film to at least understand what anyone is saying because of 20 background music and scratching the sound track. I was willing to blame the cinema equipment but not so - I've had the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the film's production. The music and sound were supposed to be distorted to create a very annoying effect within the film. These days, directors will go even further to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see this movie the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So regardless of the historical faults of this movie (which you can know yourself elsewhere), Soundtrack Distortion is in itself a good reason to give this movie a miss. You will only hear a distorted scratch in the sound track and certainly not the cat's meow.
