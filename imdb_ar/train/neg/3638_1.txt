The film depicts France's unresolved problems with its colonial heritage in West Africa through its intricate and intricate analytical publication, France (representing the symbol of its nation). It is often an attractive and challenging picture of a young woman's desire to reconcile with a painful moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach the "other" she once owned and formed. This is reflected in the way in which it is entirely centered around the idea of ​​travel (or transit) from present to the past; recalling the facts to undeniable contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> All characters play a symbolic role, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. France, which is meant to be a visual and representative representation of contemporary French society, is indifferent to its plight, as it seems to be still as naive as a child in fact as a child who seems to have the most possession of it. The rest of the rag band forget only. Black Africans, at the very least, are offensive impressionist images of the former colonized peoples now colonized by the mismanagement of their output. They are nothing more than a dark, hedonistic backdrop of France-like fascination, looking for a world it has never known and hoping for in a world that can not be found in Cameroon.
