A really terrible film prepared by a cinematographer who turned out to be Ted's co-director. A decent looking movie but a time bomb movie completely free of any tension at all. Ford, in the words of someone here, walks though this person is characterized by his distinctive smile. There are some details about the former Canadian Army or the Royal Air Force that have been deactivated in the war, and his wife leaves him - but none of these background stories add much. The bomber itself is a complete puzzle. Why is he trying to blow up this mine shipment? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? World War II or post-war? I assumed that it was the latter who made the bomber's motive clearer. Overall, though, it's just a terrible film. There are lots of good time bomb clicks to get past this picture. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting period, at approximately the same run time.
