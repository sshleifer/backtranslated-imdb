Visually stunning? Certainly. I've seen some good looking movies in some time. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses brilliant cinema, computer graphics and creative future designs to create a world that is historically familiar but something entirely new. The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 1940s. The film tells the recent attacks on New York City by automatic armies that steal generators and the like for inexplicable reasons. Also, the mysterious disappearance of scientific minds coincide coincidentally. Who can stop them and save the world? Well, it does not take a leap in faith to know that Captain Sky himself with his sad girlfriend is always a hot reporter in the lead, and in the wings he has a reliable, meticulous companion. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and the graphics lacking in storytelling and characterization. The plot for this film is ridiculous. However, the film will feel like a series of previous film series. They had stories far from bad behavior - but none of them, nor any of them, had the budget and big names that the film bore. Oscar-winning artists can exist if they keep a film standing on their feet, as one might think, but Skye captain drowns miserable. Despite his wonderful dark appearance, I found myself wishing the film would end, and I could continue in my life. I had little interest in the story aroused little attention. I never cared about any of the brilliant photography. Paltrow was just awful. Julie was a joke with no role. The law can not hold the traditions of one line directly on its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, it's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The saddest thing in the captain's sky, at least for me, was that he carried a lot of promises but he did not achieve much. I felt bored for ten minutes in the film - waiting for something to get my attention - and never came.
