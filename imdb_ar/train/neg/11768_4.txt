This reboot is similar to the McDonald's meal that was processed compared to the 2003 "Incredible Hulk", which Ang Lee gave very well. <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a comic book of the thinker. The structure takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when it does, we see the conflict in the heart of our hero. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he gives in to this anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this to that of Edward Norton, where there is no conflict in his character, and turns into the structure whenever he becomes enthusiastic and his pulse rate reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but 200). For this reference, this seems closer to the introduction of the average Cloris in the "stealth threat", which demonstrates how powerful the "force" is with one, as if the Sufi abilities can be measured through a blood test. In 2008, all that Ed Brown's Bruce Banner had to do was keep his pulse rate below 200, and monitor it with a device on his wrist. For a record, it is extremely difficult to get a pulse rate of up to 200 even through a very exhilarating process, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He suppressed the memories of his mother's death and the role of his father in his early life. On the surface, be quiet, but there is a great anger, enough anger to inflame the temple when it is launched. But the temple does not deliberately kill, even the attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or get close to my house Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He can not shoot, and in one critical sight, he saves a fighter plane chasing him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, there are visual effects, but as necessary. Motion scenes (and many of them) are essential to the plot, unlike the 2008 film Action for Action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn it into a "runaway" of the story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the structure. For him, the structure is a serious side effect of the experiment. Lewis Leiterer, the director who attracts the idea of ​​Ed Norton, failed to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Halk relationship. The story can be summed up as follows: Banner and Hulk are kick kick butt, Banner and Hulk are followed kick kick. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that conflicts with the 2003 film is that it probably is not true for comic books like the 2008 version. However, even if you are a comedian, I prefer a film that does not apply to comedy As a fanboy dream, but he is admirable towards the 2008 version of the pro comics but manufactured and excellent. "<br /> <br /> Ang Lee may have read more of the storyboards, and Iron Man, also released in 2008, is an ideal example of a movie that applies to the roots of a comic book and has a heart.
