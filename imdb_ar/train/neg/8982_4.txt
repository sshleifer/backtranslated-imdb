My nose is a bit bent on shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film a few weeks ago yet to appear, so I suppose it was rejected, although it meets all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first time in thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Mola, the veteran actor who appeared in major productions such as Blow and Alamo. Leonor Wattling is also very good. Unfortunately, everything drowns eventually under the weight of a really terrible scenario. There is also an abundance of unexplained arrogance that does nothing to advance the novel or to give an impressionistic difference to what is a piece of art that has been beautifully photographed. <br /> <br /> A real day trip to the beach in Valencia is much less difficult than having to confront these fictional characters again anywhere and anytime.
