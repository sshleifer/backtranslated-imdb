I just rented this day .... I heard lots of good reviews in advance. Wonderful!! What a pile of steaming stools this movie is !! Does anyone know the title of the director until I can recover five dollars ???? Finally, someone shocked "stop loss" from the spot of "the worst of the Iraq war at all." To be fair, I do not think there are any good Iraqi war films anyway, but that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not go into any technical errors, there are 100 reviews from other GWOT veterinarians that you all know. If the director bothered to consult even with the least bit about technical accuracy, they might have made the film somewhat realistic .... maybe. I think the author should be given the "credit" for wasting the film. It is clear that he or she conspired to plot this film from a living fantasy that does not suffer from the limitations of reality. Does anyone wonder about the purpose of this film? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am very surprised by all the really positive ratings. It's hard to watch this film as a veterinarian because of all the blurred errors, but even if one can overlook it, the plot is sucked, characters are shallow (at the very least) and acting is poor at best. I think it's ironic that this film is supposed to be about explosive disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
