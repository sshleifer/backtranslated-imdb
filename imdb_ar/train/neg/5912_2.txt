Having enjoyed Mike Myers' previous work, my expectations of bond fraud in the 1960s were fairly high. It became clear after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as childish and sinful as possible. I analyzed off after ten minutes. I watched him the other day for the second time to see if I was unfair the first time. I closed it after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a 12 year old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is awkward electronic, and Myers painful to watch (as Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Pastard Fat makes things worse. Apart from the moderately entertaining title and design of the drug group, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Personally, I advise you to avoid this like a plague, although many of my friends have enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).
