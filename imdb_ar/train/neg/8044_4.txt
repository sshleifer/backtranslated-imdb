Well, I've watched this movie since just over two years, and now I took it out of the dusty shelf to see it again and I have to say, I think this movie is really good. This film was a big sensation, as Bootleg knew what I did last summer 3, like Final Stab was in Scream 4, and this movie is not that bad. I mean it was flawed, and of course it would be funny to launch it in the theaters, but as the flick continues in the middle of the night, this movie is not bad. She has some concerns, and some really hot women have added. In addition, it shows a new look for Joy Lawrence, although it is clear that he has not won any of Hollywood's big roles either ...... I felt bad for a man, and he had such a profession in the early and mid-nineties with flowering, some show Disney movies and Lawrence Brothers forever ..... Joy Lawrence was a minor player in the comedic scene, but as in 360 degrees, his career has only turned south in producing low-budget films like this. <br /> <br /> The movie also tells you, makes you think among the crew, there really someone knows, to be finally disappointed only to know the secret. I had an idea of ​​the killer, I had an idea, but I still do not think the killer was who he was, but his motives with the secret were a big disappointment. Now, was there a secret that was brought out? This movie can be one of the best films rated B but I'm also a sucker for college subjects and I also went to college for a spring break in a beach house the size of a palace similar to the house here, which made me feel only passion for this film. <br /> <br /> A flick until bright. Good for Midnight Movie.
