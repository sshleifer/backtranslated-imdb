I can see young girls enjoying this show, but describing this family show is ridiculous. I am amazed at the extent of my memory after all these years. It is a very stupid and stupid offer of a widow of three children who live with his deceased brother's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons continue. All conspiracy lines generally have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else and each episode makes up for an unfamiliar joke. For actors, I did not like them too. Bob Sagette was as painless as the father with my mother's responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a 30-year-old joke that speaks of cartoon sounds and acts like a child, which is terrible. John Stamos was the most tolerant figure but he was a cliche that was hard to see. The biggest girl, DJ, was in the show a really bad actress and did not show any emotion at all. The middle girl Stephanie was very vulgar like a naughty little sister. The youngest Michelle girl showed what a bad actress that Olsen twins were. You can always specify when to turn them off. The plot lines of many lines of story were unrealistically stupid, worthy. This "family" offer tried to replace any good substance with attractiveness and love, and although that was necessary to show about a family they had gone too far. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-in in the 1980s and 1990s. <br /> <br /> My rating: A terrible show. TVG 30 minutes.
