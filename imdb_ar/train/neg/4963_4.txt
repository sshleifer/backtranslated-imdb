Turned into another failed attempt by the funny science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure that as a 17-year-old teenager, I thought it would be nice to have an arc in the film range. AAAAAAAH! When I saw this part, I lost all hope. After that ... they set out for their hoot in what appeared to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed! When they arrived at Heorot, (which is supposed to be Hall Norse mead), a group of idiots scientists decided to make the horot look like a large stone castle. When I saw this part .. I wanted to scream. I really wanted to have this film well, but science fiction has not produced a good film yet, so I do not know why my hopes soared. Oh .. and Gendall and his mother, too stupid. (This comment is off topic for "Grendel") If anyone from the science fiction channel reads this .. there are some good tips. Not every movie has to be about the big monsters that can rip people in half, that's not what sci-fi about! Also, the low-profile actors Stephen Baldwin have stopped to be in your movies! The movie does not help, but it makes it worse !!!
