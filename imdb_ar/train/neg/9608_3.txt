Man, what the hell were the people who made this film? More importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone of the film: a woman walking naked in the circle of fire, turning into a wolf. This is not Rick Becker's transformation of the American Werewolf, people. We are talking about some of the worst make-up taken on the film here. I can only imagine some of the stone-encrusted Italian glue on a naked Anorel Borrell (who plays the role of Daniela, the hero of the film (is that a word?), And asks her to spin in fur. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> From here on, the situation does not improve much. The minutes are wasted while the male actors laugh at chewing Daniela and her condition or anything (I can not remember, but the dialogue is very bad if you do not laugh at it you will cry). <br /> The funny thing is that Daniela is not even from a werewolf, she mentally exercises mental whenever there is a man (concept, where she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a wolf like her predecessor (opening scene). She can only tear the throat of every man she meets, and she just wants to be loved! Things start to look for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a strange man who is not motivated by "rings". Learn about the montage here, which is one of the most cheerful you ever see (laughing and hugging after diving the first time in the window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's luck does not hold because the film takes a brutal turn, suddenly beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the unknown man. Remembering "I spit on your grave", Daniela extracts bloody revenge from her oppressors. <br /> <br /> These are 100 minutes of my life I will never go back to. But hey, this is the game you play when you are obsessed with movies.
