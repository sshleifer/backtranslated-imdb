I really do not like this movie .... mainly because of the main characters! Both are immature, selfish, and centered around themselves. They hurt everyone around them playing a silly game. Visual effects were good, but what's useful if there are no related characters or an interesting storyline. Am I supposed to be happy when these two psychos finally complete their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I was thinking "This is supposed to be number one from France?" ......... <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> As for the end: RIDDANCE is good! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
