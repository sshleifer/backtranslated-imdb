Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to a woman from the television station - is right: Los Angeles police are corrupt, violent and racist police. This film does not change anything about it. Well, here are the good policemen, the moral police, even the black policemen, they are Christians, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, I admit it. Reality is not. Most important for traffic lovers: the shooting is boring. It's just shooting, shooting and shooting. nothing else. Play Counter Strike, then you'll have at least something to do. The only moral of this film is: LAPD is good now. No more bad policemen in it. If you love commercials non-critical and verbal to police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest business I've ever seen. (2 points for camera editing).
