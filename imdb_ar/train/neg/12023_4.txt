Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who has been in mental shelter for more than a decade after he was found to be wondering about the back roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will restore his lost memories if he succeeds. But when the hallucinogenic drug gives him a demon, he chooses to escape instead. While abroad, he approves a boy who abuses his mother's husband (Greg Grunberg) from his mother, will not let her approach the dark room in his basement and act suspiciously in general. <br /> <br /> While the general "puzzle" movie is an easy way to determine the way before it is revealed, I found that Mr. Diamond's representation is powerful enough to keep my attention all the time. (In the interest of full disclosure, I've been a fan of him since the murder and his short but very pivotal role in The Shield to Journeyman & Dollhouse) is not a great film or a good film, but it can be done well. Although I liked it better than the previous films I saw from the director / writer Michael Horst (Room 6, Bomkinhead 4, Manscito) <br /> <br /> Eye candy: One pair of hallucinations in the breast </ br> /> My estimate: C-
