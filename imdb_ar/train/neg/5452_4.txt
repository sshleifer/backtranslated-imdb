As far as movies go, this is quite lovable. Interesting characters, good dialogue, interesting story enough. I really wanted to do that if I did not feel very angry when I saw the total lack of respect for the city in which it was located. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except Sean's girlfriend, Dutch). You hear only transient Scottish dialects in inferior jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her "real" movies to be more like real), I do not really think that would hurt one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least got the English language that could be spoken with a decent accent ! The futile attempt to use the word "Wei" several times did nothing but increase the insult.
