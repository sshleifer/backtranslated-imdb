This was the worst film I have ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) can not act at all! She had no emotion. Everything was blah blah as if she were reading a boring book. The smart child and the child who loves the food (there are names that do not deserve to be remembered) were very annoying and made me crazy. When we talked about something scientific or food. Molys Dad did not show enough feelings about losing his daughter. A police officer and father Moulis said the same thing like four times. It was just awful. Everything was way back to a lot. Beatrice had to have something bad happened to her because she meant it. I wasted a moment in my life watching this movie!
