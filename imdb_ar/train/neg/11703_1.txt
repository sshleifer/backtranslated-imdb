You'll notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and talks, is played by Stephen King. "Do not give up your daily job" is the normal thing to say, but this is not fair. King is getting well: he's no worse than any other team member, and better than most. The story, on the other hand, is pure nonsense. Please, give up your daily job. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many horrific performances - and perhaps the main actor (the main actor!) is the worst - gathered in a single film. Everyone behaves in a fleeting way, but not in any amusing way, all of which somehow managed to reach the top without spending or showing energy. I blame the screenwriter / director Tom Holland. Not all actors can be so bad. What are the possibilities against it? I have not heard of any of them before, but still, I do not think I can walk into a talent agency and go out with many bad artists if I try: One actor, despite my best efforts, will turn from talented. So, what is the most likely - that Tom Holland went to dozens of successive snake, or that he wrote a poor script and then put it in a bad way? This would also explain why the actors performed poorly as they appeared in the script. The more the actor moves, the worse. ("You want me to bend like cams, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and feel bored, all at the same time? Well ...") <br /> <br /> This confirms the theory that the Netherlands Doubtful of participating in writing a lousy script. Many writers commented here on the fact that Billy Hallik is not a pet figure, but that's a misleading way to put it. He is not a well-known figure. All we know about him before the start of supernatural things is that he is fat, and all he can think of is food. "All I can think of is food," he tells us, with all help.) Finally ... <br /> <br /> (sigh) I suppose I should include a warning about the spoiler here ... <br /> < In the end it becomes evil. why? I can only shrug. Maybe it was under a kind of magic. Yes, that's probably it. By the word "evil" I might mean "inexplicable" - it is not as bad as it is socially undesirable comment to the ordinary psychologist. In any case, his actions in the end are meaningless, the actions of any meaningless person, this although the characters do little but explain their motives in favor of the public. <br /> <br /> By the way, here's the candidate for the biggest line / delivery: "I do not think you want it ... in fact ..." [dramatic pause] "... I do not think you want it at all."
