Question: A family goes to a new home and is driven by demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Every horror film I saw? Yes, that's true, but that's not the solution I'm looking for. I will narrow it by saying that there are a lot of teenage anxiety scenes. Does not help? Well, there are lots of bits that track characters by a creature and see characters through a POV creature. Not futuristic forward? Well, there's a dream sequence that has lots of blood? It can be any horror film you say. Oh, this may take weeks so I say the movie I'm talking about is a lot of Aussies features that many of them have appeared in the neighbors and home. Yes, it's true that the movie is the third session (also known as CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the exercises above are? It is me and I point out that the third session is not quite different from any horror film produced
