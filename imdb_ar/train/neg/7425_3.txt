It's impossible to watch and participate in the barely equipped Las Vegas movie, something you can look at if you do not have anything better. Both of the appropriate things in this film are linked to the wonderful night of Stella Stevens and the other spends the whole program in the hope of falling from one of those worn tops worn. Many great shots in the mid-1970s from Las Vegas (when it was still a great place to visit), and the daily fashions give a wonderful touch to laughter. Otherwise, one big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good transfer but at less than $ 10, but it is not worth it in my humble opinion.
