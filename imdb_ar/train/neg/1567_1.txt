I had to change my view on the worst film in the world after I saw this movie. That's it! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> A hopeless story (although it's based on a real story). The appalling representation (what Judge Reinhold thought of) was unusual. Childhood dialogue. Lack of continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
