(This may be a little on the spoiler side). I would like to start by saying that I did not watch the whole film, and I can not because it was clear from the very first hour that I was very disappointed. This is of course the problem of taking what many thought was a wonderful book and turning it into a Disney-made movie. <br /> <br /> Wrinkle in Time was supposed to be a long time ago. It has a great story that can connect children and adults. Plus it is built in a quality sequel. But the Disney game was not a way to go. The problem with the film is that all the things they have changed to turn it into a visual story have abandoned what was wonderful in the book. It is a complex and emotional story for children. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace "psychologically" pure, because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between Mrs. W. The three as additional tension, there was enough tension in the story without it. There was no reason to remove Meg glasses ... which deprived us of what could have been a wonderful sight between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could have had small days around small things, but I also think that the bigger things, like the artistic direction, were parked. Take for example the way they made the Camazotz look, with its strangely dark sky. The crawl that appears in the book is that Kamazote may be the Earth. It looks like Earth. There are people who look like humans. The sky is blue and the grass is green and there are children playing. But there is something a bit off. The directors chose to convert Kamazotz to a full other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the film. The lesson of course is that Camazoot can be a land, and that's if we forget how to love. It was nice to spend a nice afternoon as they walked down the street with the kids wearing balls the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I did not see the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney disrupted the end too. <br /> <br /> In general, technical disappointment. <br /> <br />
