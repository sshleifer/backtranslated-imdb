After a nude shower scene somewhat partially covered, we go to the races in the film "Blair's Witch Project" - we ask a horror film about three girlfriends venturing out of a cabin in the depths of the woods to get away from their hectic girls' weekend and pot smoking. They meet two young people who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell the ghost stories, until some of the film is snatched away. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly slow film, with unnecessary thrill. "Scenes, bad acting can not hold countless scenes where nothing happens but a reckless joke, the whole movie is a dull bird, and it is deadly boring in it." Nothing happens at all until the last half an hour, and when I did that I had to I'm being seduced to take care of the real. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin presents T & A; Effie Lutzky is naked for a short time; Jennifer Hart shows her right nipple <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
