I recently watched this movie on a DVD and I must say I was not impressed. I know it is taboo to put up independent films, but this film was deprived of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis was interesting, but its implementation was short. I found myself thinking, "Well, they have entered it, the story will soon be moving." Before I knew him, the film was over and the story never ended. I can not say I found acting all so impressive too. It was very bad. Star Wars is not a bad trio, but bad nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how long it took, I'll assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the film ended, I felt as if I deserved some kind of appreciation for the willpower I exercised in not stopping the movie and walking halfway. <br /> <br /> Once again, I felt completely impressed, and eventually bored of my wits. I'm not one of those guys who need quick movements and explosions in a movie, so do not start me because that's why I do not like it.
