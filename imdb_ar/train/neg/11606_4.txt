Decent enough with some stylish pictures, but the small budget hinders things. <br /> <br /> I also feel you have the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the strange website's graphs. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in certain things like internet city and m police, this may rise up in your street. <br /> <br /> But basically the low budget matrix in cash is not entirely devoid of its own style. <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack by some bands that have never been heard of Grunge / Punk / Another Grunge. Worth checking out if only for soundtracks.
