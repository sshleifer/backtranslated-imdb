Let me start by saying that I fully agree with the basic thesis of the film, that perhaps there was no historical Jesus and Christianity is a disgrace. With this saying, this film does a very bad job to prove this message. It offers good arguments - the gap between the theoretical life of Jesus and the writing of the Gospels, filled only with the writings of Paul, which does not refer to Jesus historical - and then fails in convincing argument. It produces extensive data without providing the evidence on which the data are based, and resolutely ignores the counter arguments of Christian defenders. Intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation, and the absence of a serious and clear argument. The only Christians we hear from in the film are the head of the old school of film director - who starts like a sane and rational person trying to deal with a frown with a slice on his shoulder - and many Christians are randomly faced in a parking lot. I'm sorry, but revealing that ordinary Christians do not know much about their religion is not proof of Christian deception. It may also claim that Jay Leno has disproved the presence of Michael Dukakis in his Jay-Wook section. Interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is so full, let's be honest, the film director is just cloudy. During the first five minutes, the film actually merged Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the Left Behind book with Branch Davidians. In the end, the film becomes so self-centered that there is no rational argument left, just an angry Christian criticizing people and blaming his corrupt childhood. Yes, this film may have been interesting, but it is misplaced in a documentary about the history of Jesus, a self-congratulation to the point of emptying any sympathy. This is Michael Moore's film without humor or the acumen of making films accompanied by Richard Dawkins's book without intelligence or intellectual rigor. skip it.
