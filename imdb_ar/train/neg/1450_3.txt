If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of World War I and not the history of World War II. He discovered what happened during that war, and how the soldiers had to live around the bodies of the dead all the time. How many of the soldiers were mad, what they saw during the First World War, while they called it the "shock" now called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the horrors of the First World War, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a person can become mortal, not because of their evil, but simply because it is the only way for them to deal with the horrors surrounding them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film lacks this, because many others do. Read some books on this subject, and you should watch "The Paths of Glory", the only good World War I film he ever made. You will see the frustration felt by the soldiers in this film, the feeling of helplessness, the low absolute value of human life, nothing more than just lead hunters. <br /> <br /> This is what this film lacks, it really is the key to Germany's understanding. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, for no real reason. Then comes the complete economic collapse after the war. These are the factors that lead to extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and extreme poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors, and just became another piece of crap to throw it on the pile. With no real value, there is a fictional film based on fictional characters that can provide you with a better idea of ​​Hitler than that. They just threw Hitler's name on this so they would sell more.
