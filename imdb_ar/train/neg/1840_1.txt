This must be the most wildly funny "comedy" I've ever seen. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Christopher and Alan as a crazy homeless man, does not he make me laugh? There must be something wrong with this picture. This is the only film I've ever felt. I have used free permits and I still feel like I wanted to restore my money. I can honestly say that the only film I saw worse than this film was "House of Death." The. Just. worst. Movie. I laughed a little in a fun scene, that's it. Spending two hours in something that is described as a comedy should make you more than a laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought that the word "flan" was a funny word or something like that. The other joke that works at all is hitting a dead horse - literally.
