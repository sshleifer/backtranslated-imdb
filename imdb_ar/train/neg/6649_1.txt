Well, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was fantastic or good is either an illusionist or director, writer and producer and tries to promote participation in this film. I saw the movie because one of my friends was working on it and it was terrible. I am an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big and even independent movies and this movie made me cry. The reason I am so cruel is that this film was obviously a different film from "mice and men" and they have to sue because it is such a terrible rupture of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be bankrupt in a creative way ... for someone to take a classic book and film "from mice and men" and destroy it with a new twist around me. Actors, dialects, dialogue and direction were amateur and writing was dismal. I mean, if you want to take a new spin on an existing story, make sure it's good or better than the original to illustrate the new rotation. I did not like this movie at all.
