I saw this day, and I was attracted in part to the whole team of stars and I enjoyed a lot of other films of this kind. However, this is the one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where there is no flow of continuity, the challenge of billiards at first, for example. The scenes of fighting with the indigenous people are as good as you remember in the old black and white Tarzan movies. You know where you see a spear fly in the air and cut the camera into a dead, dead citizen lying motionless on the ground and out of his thigh. Is this death immediate? There are also many unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the scheme, such as the little girl who is saved while collecting flowers. Terrible clay toys are very painful to watch. If you see this movie, crabs that reach forward at about 5 km per hour are the most prominent. Somehow one can sneak into David McCullum and give him. As if there was no time out of the way, as when an obelisk falls in the city, the citizen has all the time in the world to take a step to the left, but does not scream and falls on him. I just give this 2 due to Ekland. And why did Mccullums voice develop stutter as the film progresses?
