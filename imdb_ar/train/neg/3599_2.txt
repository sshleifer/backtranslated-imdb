Umm .. I was quite amazed that someone gave this movie already high marks. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress. This film proves how talented she is. The movie plot was weak ... I bet that idiot who came up with this concept was Tom Peeping. If there is something good about this film, I will say that it is the daughter of Tommy Chung, just because she is his daughter ... Then there is the mention of Soap-Opera-ish which looks pretty good to make him attractive, but stops to help his dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many ways can you simply say "suck this movie"?
