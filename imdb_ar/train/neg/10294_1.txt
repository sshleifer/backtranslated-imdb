Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then characters that do not have personality develop. <br /> <br /> The end will never come because there is no beginning or middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful clips that are not beautiful because they are not allowed to do so, because this movie is not there. There is no "in" this film because there is no plot, characters, features, ideas, symbolic, discussion, dialogue or point. nothing! <br /> <br /> There's a good point: it has a good track. But editing the sound this way, the film is so appropriate that watching it is not worth your time, so if you're really interested, I suggest going and buying soundtracks or something. You'll get all you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
