It's really a terrible and wasteful movie for two hours of your life. It's simultaneously a nice attack, with nudity and lots and lots of violence. However, nudity is not exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. Also, the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the representation is some of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it is not. I did not laugh once while watching it, and I did not even smile. The filmmakers tried to combine comedy and action, and failed in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some bad-made movies are funny because they are too bad, but this is not one of them.
