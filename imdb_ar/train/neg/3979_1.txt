Well, I got this 2 to be one of the worst excuses (4) a movie I had trouble watching. Like all the other Olsen twin films with a possible exception to the New York minute, this film has no story, great plot holes, disgustingly represented and filming so bad !!!!!!!!! In case you have not guessed yet I hate Mary Kate and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I saw was that I was really bored and there was nothing else. I wonder if the twins will never stop producing the same stereotypes as they have an incredibly stupid adventure in a strange place and at the same time get help from two nice players who are salivating immediately. The least they can have is a 4 or 1 man that both have 4 drops the same person. The plot in this story was very vague and simple. Even the young child can see the flaws in it. Maybe they should split the movies and start making them individually or perhaps movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who likes this movie has never had a crime - either really stupid or really artificial or has not seen any really good movie. Or maybe she's really smart and has bad film choices. Either way, I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy for a good movie experience .. The only good thing is 4 is some laugh at the rib's pathetic attempts. If you watch laughing it's hilarious. Basically I give it 0 or less.
