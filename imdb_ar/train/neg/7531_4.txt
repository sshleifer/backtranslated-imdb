This is, apparently, a film about multiple grief. As such, they have to move viewers and make them sympathetic to the plight of the main characters. However, the disturbing postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera moves from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating a sporadic, disconnected effect. It seems that most characters live a life without purpose, unorganized, consistent with their professional commitments. (It also extends to the credibility that a man who has just given up to the possible death penalty will indulge in a sexual joke with a woman he has just met) that is difficult to follow (if there is a story). In short, the overall effect is disappointing. Despite all this, the representation is generally good and some scenes very strong.
