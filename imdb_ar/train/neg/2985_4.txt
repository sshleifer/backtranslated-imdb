When I finally had the chance to see Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheatres 2 in Europe) on the DVD for Region 2 importation, I was amazed at how affected this epic zombie epic was. We will look unless you get Anchor Bay from it. Jour highlights really well, and you can really appreciate the wonderful make-up and hard paper. The sound is great too. It's the only Dolby channel but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate the cheese music (actually a very good grade) and the sound effects are effective even though they are cheap. This does not look good at all, and excellent transport adds to overall pleasure. <br /> <br /> I have never realized how much blood flow in this film, it is so brutal with the bursting of the head shots and the detonation of pimples filled with huge burger, the cleaver in the throat of the zombie, the burning of a woman from the limbs (how it happened, the man did not burn too) , Intestinal chewing, baby coma and much more I lost track. <br /> <br /> This is no doubt for Zombie lovers of the hardcore, especially the Italian type. There are some excellent cinematic and cinematic footage that can be found, I think people do not give it enough credit. If you see a clean copy, not a horrible copy of piracy, it's a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is never allowed in the second, and I realize it is completely inconsistent. The dubbing is horrible, the acting is strong, and the sense of disrespect is celebrated in a wonderful way, but that's part of its magic. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies ever produced, you can not make a movie filming a bad, very good film, intentionally. He is an occasional genius of the highest rank. If they laughed, it was a disaster, but they played it straight as arrows and the result is a wonderful classic of thumb worship. Nose in any and all traditional filmmaking standards. <br /> <br /> Lots of movement sequences, exotic languages, excellent group design, good, sometimes gre in cinematography, wonderful cheese representation, inconsistent but still interesting plot, wonderful make-up effects, beautiful women who can Running with a butt, excellent music, sometimes fun, sometimes creepy, but always amusing with zombies. He has everything, the classic cult stands the test of time.
