I do not know anyone who cares, but I know him. This film is historical for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes of two fictional films in the seventies of the last century. Well, one great and the other very bad. One really great great, actually is the best. The bad is really bad, it's really the worst. Of course, the greatest star wars and starring Mark Hamil, also known as Luke Skywalker, the hero of this film about a child passed through him and then moved to Vegas (ahead) after a wide range of adventures, eventually recovers. (Since it's in car repair, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way he met a whore with a heart of gold, ending up confronting a character played by Kim Milford, the 1970's science fiction cult hero "Laserblast", which, as I mentioned earlier, was the worst science fiction film ever. Milford plays the role of Hamdi, who must steal his car from him. I realize that no one cares about this meeting between two great science fiction heroes, but I'm interested. I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies ever. Mark Hamill's acting needs strength, and the plot needs intense training, and the personality of Annie Potts may be the most disturbing character of any film I have ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend, or a night of the week, late at night, and too late. It is one of those films that stumble, look for something but not find it well, and at the same time, the whole purpose is, like free jazz, to exist as it is. And he does. What is, is not wonderful, but you can not say it is not a mess, because you may feel upset for an hour and a half, but you will not feel cheated. So close your mind, relax, and enjoy these confused gems without any expectations, and may be always with you.
