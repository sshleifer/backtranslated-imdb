You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. You believe that he is the Son of God or not. The option is up to you. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Denys Arcand really did everything in his power to bring Jesus back to a historical figure, a social worker, the son of two human beings, instead of the Holy Son of God, Spirit and Mary, who opened paradise again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution, rather than seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theology that brings some "modern results" to the actor who plays the role of Jesus in the drama of passion, which merges them happily into his play. <br /> <br /> The illustrious priest who runs the campus where the passion game is played in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the players in Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. Often, the shortcomings of the director of the church are evident. <br /> <br /> The director attempted a parallel action between the life of Jesus and the life of the actor in Passion Play. This is an impressive attempt, but the portrayal of the resurrection through the cultivation of actors in Passion Play in other bodies demonstrates how the director in Jesus thinks. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion, but I do not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors standing in front of the throne of Jesus.
