This clone "LOCK STOCK" is really deep with astral team and terrible text. I have no idea why many senior British representatives have been involved in this scavenger, they must have been sprayed. Miss's game continues forever and forever, and if I did not pay good money for it, I stopped it after 10 minutes. It was not the worst film I've ever seen. This honor went to the really pathetic bugroll in "GUMMO" (I feel like I'm suing the director of the lost watch for half of my life), but that trash is almost there Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen ... Such things remember Hollywood that they do not monopolize really horrible movies.
