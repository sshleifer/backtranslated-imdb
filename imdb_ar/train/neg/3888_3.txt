I'm starting to melt, so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There is an astronaut, and he climbs into a spacecraft with two other young men, you know? Except what happens to expose him to radiation, then when he returns ... Well, do not care what happened to others, but our astronaut began to melt! No, not only burn, but melt! Such as ice cream cone in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it gets all red and stupid, and the fact that it melts makes it really crazy. I think he also reviewed the Man of Fusion book because he suddenly knows that to keep away from perfect fusion, he has to eat human flesh, so he begins to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts (and melts), do you really need anyone else? What is the important thing that will be dealt with after that, and what will remain of them? How long will it take to dissolve? Why was this film made in the first place? Where did they get the money? When do you fall asleep watching him? <br /> <br /> It's almost melted away, but I still have time to tell you that this is a frighteningly boring film, although the idea is really wonderful and nice. Of the total. Stylish makeup but everything else ... SPLAT
