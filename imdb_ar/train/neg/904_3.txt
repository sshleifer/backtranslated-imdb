"Stella", starring Bet Meidler in a starring role, is a shameless teardrop game. Stella Claire is located in New York State, and serves nights as a maid in the bar and pours and dances at the working salon. One night, a modest medical apprentice, Stephen Dallas, who was afraid of Stella, arrives and, during their relationship, drinks it. Rejects all of his offers for marriage and abortion, sends him packing to a profitable medical career, and raises her daughter herself in a state of near poverty. Flash forward 16 years, daughter grew up to become a wonderful young lady, love. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, still retains a weak relationship, but with the care of his daughter ?? .. I roam, and even worse, make the film look pretty fun. The acting and writing of film is too far-fetched, and will drop its gaze in almost every scene. The main culprit is Bette Midler, but John Goodman is the close friend of her friend. Every scene seems more crowded than before to the end, and it is really a scream. If we take it as an exciting piece, this movie does not exceed class D, but as a camp, it registers B +. <br /> <br />
