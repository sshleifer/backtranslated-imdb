"Three Bold Girls" is a deadly, rosy look at divorce, remarriage and living with a single parent. It is clear that social issues and economic hardship have no place in the picture. The ideal life of a single mother who is tired, moves, and then returns and marries a squad leader. Even if the phrase "just a movie" relieves the text from addressing real-life problems, "girls" suffer from a lot of inconsistent high-resolution songs, children whose characters do not depend on real children and the leader of the band, Iturbe, plays himself. Is not it strange that any real person starred in a movie in which his real character is alleged to be married? <br /> <br /> It is recognized that this film was released in the 1990s. Just love the old style of Hollywood romance and comedy can make the "girls" movie acceptable.
