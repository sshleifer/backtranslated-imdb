It looks like a poor TV show the 1980s lost and tried to become a fine pornographic film. My God was bad. The conspiracies of each person were of little relevance. The plot itself was not anything to talk about. Something about a stalker, I guess. In the end shoots himself? It's not really clear, but there's a volleyball game in some way. The main character (Randy) sleeps around her a lot. The only reason to hire my friends for this film is that Casper Van Dien was in it, and ended up wanting to progress quickly backstage with him, which was barely visible in it. Thank God I have not spent any money on it, but I want to return that hour of my life.
