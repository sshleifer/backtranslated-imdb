Let me start by saying how much I like the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man apparently unable to follow his dreams because of his arrogant and circumspect father, he was very lukewarm and really fun to watch. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the greatest British comedy series of all time. The TV series has a rating of 10 out of 10 without reservation. <br /> <br /> This casual film on the other hand is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is successfully transferred to the film. This film has a very depressing and frustrating tone that made me cry on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten in a pub (not comedy) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but it is certainly one of the reasons why TV series fans do not like this movie. The film was unusually unusual except for the scene where Albert bathed in the tub and was seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> Romance between Harold and Zeta is quite out of tune and makes me wonder if the producers bothered this movie to watch the TV series. In the television series, Harold always pursued respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reaction to the statements made against him by Harold's friends was invaluable in the television series. In the film, Albert says almost nothing when such an opportunity increases. <br /> <br /> Most of the British film shows of the British comedy series tend to be quite boring, with a notable exception in the films ON THE BUSES (which in some films were actually better than the TV series itself!). But on STEPTOE AND SON the arrangement is at the bottom of the heap directly, even down GEORGE and MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this advice and watch the second show, STEPTOE and SON RIDE AGAIN while. His tone is much lighter, more fulfilling than the TV series, which is actually very funny.
