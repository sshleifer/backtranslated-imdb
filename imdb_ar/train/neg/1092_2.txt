Well, I suppose the good news about William Winkler's 2001 writing, "The Double-D Avenger," is that he is able to unify three of the marvels of mammals Ross Meyer-Hierra Natividad, Haji and Ravin de la Croix-in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tora Satana and Papeete Bardot were busy with the week they launched this thing ... or were able to see a copy of the text in advance!) The bad news, though (and there are many of them), is that this movie - If it is even possible to name it, having been filmed directly to the video - is a total imbalance, complete abortion, total brutality, absolute brutality, and really one of the worst images I have ever seen. No more searching for the supernatural supernatural film ever! This plot, as it is, deals with Kitten gaining superpower after falling into the rare caselina factory in South America to treat breast cancer (oy), and then battling a trio of huge bikini dancers back in Los Angeles so badly that every lame moron falls off a joke She is totally tense (you should pardon the expression) flat, and there is practically nude from scratch in the film at all (unlike some old pictures of Kitten in her time), and some razors and the paper noodle rock total private foreign currency. Meyer's daughters here are a bit long in age / slack in the chest, to wear them gently, although Cherie Don Thomas, as a bikini girl (Ooga Boobies!), Managed to stand out well. So why did I give this failed deceptive film to two stars instead of 1? To be brief: Joe Bob Briggs. His audio comment on the special features of the DVD I've just seen is very fun, especially when he pulls out about 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from 1000+ on the Canonical Hooters list. Man is a national treasure, he is able to upgrade this skate from disk to ship condition!
