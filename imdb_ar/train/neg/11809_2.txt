This film was bought in a bargaining box at the Rogers Video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie every now and then and I think this sounds like a good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is all about the "70s" clich√© which is so wonderful. Unfortunately, it's hard to follow the story line and not much happens in the film. In fact, I stopped it after watching it for 45 minutes and found a week later that I had to watch the whole thing regardless of its slowness. <br /> <br /> The movie has good locations, but you have to wait, wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you're in B movies, this may be just for you, but be careful that the movie is slow and not too much. Really happens, I did not mention the story line too much ... <br /> <br />
