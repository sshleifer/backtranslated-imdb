That was not funny in 1972. It was not funny now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I do not break the film because it is incredibly sexual biased - I quote that I enjoyed this thing, or rather enjoyed the reaction it generated to the annoying people in the personal computers - I attack it Because it is written and bad behavior. <br /> <br /> The only memorable character is Blakey, who will be recognized by the 25-year-old British people immediately who was the favorite of the Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
