The dialogue was very shocking. The plot is not really all that inspired the obvious evolution it offers. Not visually stunning. In fact visually annoying at times. Sure, it's easier to make a movie if you keep one finger on the fast forward button. If you can see it for free, you do not have any other options open right now, and you really look forward to seeing the little evil lady ... well, I might recommend it to you, but not anyone else I can think of right now.
