Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people who work for it ... but it's clear that someone has some common sense when the authorities give up celluloid waste ... editing is a crappo, and the plot is too thin and stupid to believe. The only reason she got two out of ten is that Stacey Nelkin takes off some clothes and gets a nice shot ... I never thought I'd be sorry because Ralph Machio made the decision to be in this thing, but I do ... and I really feel bad for Ron Lipman And Tom Boston, talented actors who should not have appeared in this film ... on the Mr. Lippman had the Cajun to refuse to put his name anywhere in the film ... and in the foreground ... there are already copies of this thing with the continuation of the Mad sequence at first ... if you can locate one, grab it, it is possible To be worth something ... it's the only thing in this movie that deserves anything ... and a remark for people at IMDb.com ... there's no way to spoil this movie for anyone ... the makers of it spoiled on their own .. .
