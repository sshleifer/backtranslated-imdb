This movie was very bad. Science fiction is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies on which I play. I really do not know if this film can be called the original. The start of a zoo / garden on a remote island looks very familiar. What was, oh yes, the Jurassic Garden. But this contains the Sabertooth Tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a few college students on the island doing some treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying of heinous death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked like ketchup. At first, there is a world that wants to make as many saber tigers as possible to enjoy. 3 of them have already fled and are wandering around eating tourists, or people invited to the island to see the tigers directly. Again, it looks like a Jurassic garden. Perhaps the coolest thing was the 1,000-pound sounding age that crawled on his front legs, killing the crazy world with a statue of teeth of some kind shrinking and walking across the players' neck. The most fatal death I have ever seen on television. <br /> <br /> The representation is very cheesy, and the special effects are terrible. The CG Tigers can pass almost to clay models, and even some sounds were extinguished. For example, when a college student tries to escape, Vasa uses a broken door, the ax goes to the door and after about two seconds you hear the sound. This movie was very bad. Cheesy deaths were very funny.
