I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) for this film and I was very disappointed. I've just seen a few good foreign movies and I was looking forward to making them three straight, but they were not. I went with a friend who speaks Spanish and felt the same way. There is not much plot, if any. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but I have to be entertaining or bring it in one way or another. The best I can say is that he aspires to be an Altman-esque film, albeit with a very small group. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments are easy to lighten through the slow 97 minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating of this film. Give it 3. <br /> <br />
