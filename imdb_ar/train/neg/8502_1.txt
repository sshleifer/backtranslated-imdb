At first it was a thrilling film, an exciting Spanish film in Madrid these days, but it's nothing of the sort. It's actually a thriller just for future filmmakers to learn not to make a film. In other words, it would not be worse, even The presence of the Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent to see this movie, the acting is horrific and the actors seem to have been waiting just to finish the footage everyday to go home, they lead nowhere and they are boring, weak and bad and do not spend time or money in this movie.
