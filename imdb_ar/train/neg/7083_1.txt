My husband rented this from a video store thinking it was a thrill. (Never read the abstract). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be fun if it was fun. It simply is not. The same thing over and over again, no intrigue, and where they found the leading man? The leading man, Michael Des Bares, is not good-looking, especially for this role given to him. Also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, hired "Detect" by Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually viewable, plays an awkward scene here. There are also cheaper lighting effects than a home web camera. Do not waste time renting this. 0/10.
