Well, people, honestly ... this should be one of the worst movies that talk about movie shows, but I was laughing silly myself (which may be why I enjoyed it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and the way to get your personal fame for 15 minutes. Have you mentioned that sex was a major issue in this film? If you have something happening to bizzzzare personalities and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and you do not have a better thing to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The most extreme thing in the film was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry Anza (!) In the show and flashed his wallet with his love pictures. And three a bad taste and fun!
