Bo Derek film still not visible eight years ago ?? And so he stayed! John Derek was an efficient actor, but as a director, he is almost Ed Wood's thriller? This is not particularly clear, since Bo (unusually dark hair) was just 16 years old when the film was made! John also wrote his photos; recent results in some decent footage of the Greek island put against it narrative? But conspiracy is childish and terrible dialogue! <br /> <br /> The male character of Peter Hooten grew up with the Bo family: they grew up as a brother and sister, but as a teenager, the couple discovered that they were attracted to each other (but, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks) !). However, the worst thing about this is the fact that every protagonist houses all the obsession through a film that is not only silly in itself but annoying in relentless? Hooten wants to transform the remote fishing community into a modern seaside resort and still expects the appearance of a cruise ship in the sight of people (and this happens of course in the end); Derek is nicer? She longs to have a large antique bathtub !! For the record, the couple marries at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The city's mayor and a Lothario photographer who want to produce a model of Bo (and / or <br />) are also involved. Who, of course, bears the wrath of Hooten jealous). Sometimes, for no good reason, we even deal with scraps of old Hollywood movies in an outdoor movie house where the whole town is gathered (among the titles being The PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while the na√Øve Bo all the time is undeniably charming, it is not enough to compensate for the overwhelming and amateur film blah.
