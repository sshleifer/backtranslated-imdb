I remembered the title very well for me, the film was Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivian Lee in supporting roles. Vincent Massey's voice was behind the bristles. Well Flora Robson was fantastic. Her next signing, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing". Same role but with different luxury gowns. And the same sound. As for the fleet, it was a sub-text. I love black and white movies. Is everything done in Elizabeth's times at night? He was loud and hard to understand, at times. I could not tell what the interest of love was. Was the Spaniard or was Vivian Lee? I do not think Elizabeth would have been a great strategy to recommend firefighters against the fleet. It seems to have worked for the empire, but not for the text. This may have been more accurate historically, but Bette Davis had more attractive texts. I missed the day!
