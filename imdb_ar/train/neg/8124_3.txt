The film depicts scenes of a tour of the scenic caves. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie remembers except Michael Pataki, who got rid of the intense pain like JC in "Five the Hard Way". He's a really annoying sheriff, he was applauded when he drowsy our mad doctor. Perhaps the most laugh you will have with epileptic seizures is Dr. Beck's nudity. Could Ms. Bek be wooden anymore? Seriously, if you have taken a 4 foot branch, stuck in a hot tub, you will not be able to notice the difference. Looking around the clock and wondering about the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a late night movie, MSTified, but do not get out of you.
