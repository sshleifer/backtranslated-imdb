This is basically a work / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed the brother of Wayans Scary Movie (1) and because it was only moments. Unfortunately the white chicks do not even offer half the laugh. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is very blunt. If you like belching, jittery, stupid slogans you should look at this most likely. When he is not raw, he is stupid. The first ten minutes of the film gave me everything away from me, which is quite strange, and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> However I have seen everything since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not be bothered). The story is indisputably high, it was a very scary film, but at least the laughter was quick and steady. I think that's probably one of the main problems in this film, too. Some jokes are pulled for a long time when they are more disgusting than funny in the first place. If you prefer your comics with a few brain cells, just avoid this. If you want a silly comedy with more laughter, look for a scary movie, a plane and two hot points. <br /> <br /> 1/10 A very thin fantasy story, a film that seems to be based on one idea. As white chicks for a movie?) But simply do not have enough material.
