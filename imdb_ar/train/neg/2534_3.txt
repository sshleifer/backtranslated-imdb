* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> Sometimes the title of this film is "eternal life." This is often taken as a reference to the latter scene, but more accurately describes how she died and was buried in this series, which was once estimated after this slow and irrational transmission. <br /> <br /> The "air show" is about this telemovie, which can be granular in the sites.Some fans will feel that they are insiders because they enjoy capturing all the features of the engraving.Component and co-producer Tom Fontana and his colleagues are packing events with friends and favorites from Other programs, plus real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> This top-of-the-range membership of the TV show casts different variations, old favorites as well as favorites later. <br /> <br /> There was always A war-conscious executive producer between Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the team Innovative against budget conscious execs of the budget, who simply want procedural police police post such as "Nash Bridges", which regularly beat the "killing" in the classification.The pressure was expressed during the presentation reversal between the open-mindedness that overtook its form and the meager excitement that weakened it. /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana and co-authors Yoshimura, Eric Overmeier and director Jean de Segonsak simply threw in a towel, took the most ridiculous story of the series, and issued it with a new plot that was unlikely and unproductive technically, Carry the whole mess on Ah D. Members of the weakest representation team. <br /> <br /> In short, it's been some time since the last episode of the show. The heart of Yaphet Kotto in the role of Lt. Giardello, the former heart of Baltimore's killing unit, is now a candidate like Kurt Schimuk for mayor, and shows himself in a good appearance. But this promising start, immediately and improbably, takes a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> Light turns to Giancarlo Esposito to become the son of Giardello. Esposito was a handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, and was one of the beautiful faces brought in late to activate the television series. But the question for viewers has always been: Is Mike uncomfortable like Son J, or is Esposito uncomfortable in the role? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito has no chance of playing the main story uninterrupted. This is because the writers have chosen this moment to revive another story that will cling to the intelligence of pro-choice voters. <br /> <br /> A clear virtual video was promoted, and it seemed to be happening on the Internet. After some red herring, the detective arrested the suspect repellent. However, the Deputy Minister of Justice in Zalko Ivanik was harassed and exhausted and forgot to submit petitions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be later killed. <br /> <br /> Let's summarize: He forgot to submit the papers because he was not the most exciting issue in his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland legislature, the Attorney General, NBC, Kurt T. The Times, The Times, London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail, The Guardian, Luciferator Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, Wakeup and Computer World do not call every 10 minutes. To ask about the case. <br /> <br /> However, the old gang of investigators and colleagues flows to Baltimore to help. There is a wide range of talent offered. Unfortunately, with a limited amount of dialogue being distributed, some are presented only. <br /> <br /> Two of the most powerful actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are being criminally exploited, while time is wasted on John Seda and Michael Michelle can spend better on commercials. The writers seem to have scoffed at this, and presented Jason Priestley as the most recent investigator. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a very easy, accessible scene. <br /> <br /> There are some other characters, with actual Lieutenant Gary Di Adario, a book center that led to the show, and another detective play. The guests come down from other programs, such as Whitney Allen playing her deadly role and "Sally Sally" tireless in the beloved children's program at Oz in Fontana. Dina Naples shows her own WBAL TV. <br /> <br /> Even when entertained, these guests can distract their attention. Ed Bigley Jr. developed the story in his short appearance, playing the role of Dr. Victor Erlich of St. Elise of Fontana. Still a live figure, fits in the hospital. And then remember, did not St. Elijos turn into the imagination of an autistic boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful pattern reflects synergy between companies. This film was produced when Court TV purchased the rerun rights for the series. The network contributed to a legal promise from Helen Luketis, who interviewed the murder team and then appeared on "Oz". The TV correspondent does an effective job summarizing the news, that is, drawing points for the late ones. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns side by side, Lucaitis also deals skillfully with little physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice seen with Lucaitis than any of his usual mates. Maybe these two people should have been separate. <br /> <br /> As the movie ends, the actors' cream rises to the top. Although they were weighed down by a losing streak, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor beat him. Their performance is reminiscent of viewers, making killing, over long periods of time, the best air show and one of the best television programs ever. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the best professionals doing their stuff; it's a shame that this film does not give them a bigger chance. Hardcore fans may want to watch this movie anyway, but you can live without it.
