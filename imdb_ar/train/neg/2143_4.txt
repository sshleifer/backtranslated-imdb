I grew up watching the original Cinderella Disney, and I have always loved it so much that the bar is slightly worn. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was on TV and I would be in good shape to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film joins the Club of Movie Consequences that it was supposed to leave alone. It absolutely bears nothing of the original super charm! It seems to me, very harsh, almost brutal, directly from (not) sing for a long time to characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the storyteller telling a story through a song, the soundtrack was placed on top of the film, and it did not seem appropriate. Jaq's transformation into a man is a prime example: he was walking around eating an apple and adding some little jokes here and there. He should have danced and sang how wonderful it was to be tall! In the dance floor, there is an old rustic barn-type music. It seems as if the writers forgot the place and timing of this story. Surely, optimistic musical games were not appropriate. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 do not live up to the original level. The artwork in this film seems very rough and less elaborate. We see part of the Cinderella collar skirt, that you do not feel it is right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been a story of its own, and I think it should have been. I will not say I hate it, but I think there are many shortcomings. It seems to significantly reduce Cinderella's original lover.
