I wanted to watch this film, but one strange scene after another forced me to stop it. Nobody seems to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks at night (across the cemetery I think) when he is attacked by spirits, driven away. Once he has overcome this ordeal, he walks quietly and meets a friend who has seen everything. When asked what was happening, he said in a tone, "Attacked by devils, nothing serious." , As if this were a little more exciting than flat tires. <br /> <br /> When they went to ask for something - a demon or something, they shut up and stopped caring for any questions. The answer can only be borrowed from someone who has the energy of his death. The priest watches what appears to be a mysterious nuisance, where the man is suspended and suspended and his question is thrown on his dead body and dies. <br /> From **** stars.
