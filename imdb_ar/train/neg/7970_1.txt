Whether you want to spend almost two hours of your life, it depends on how much you like horror movies. If you love them, God damn awful they are hysterical, watch out. The Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen (I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I say this as a fan of low-budget horror / humor and I've seen little to compare with. I will not go into details about what makes this movie as bad as it is, and the only good thing about it is that it's so terrible, it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find this for rent at a cheap price, it is certainly worth watching, if you are involved in making it - shame on you. : o) IMDb needs to make a special 0/10 rating for this movie, it's totally worth it.
