I had the misfortune to watch this trash on Sky Max Cinema on a cold winter night. I'm not a fan of horror movies, because most of them are just trash. This is even worse: it is one of the stupidest fools I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror film? Yes, there are terrible things in this matter: acting, text and special effects - my God, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a 90-minute flick. In fact, if it was a comic film I would give it 5. Do not think about renting this unless you want to make fun of the producers. <br /> <br /> rating: 2 out of 10 - no one voted because he made me laugh all the time ;-)
