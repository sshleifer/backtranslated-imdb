First - there is no ongoing flirtation in this film - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is to go into more than 15 minutes of extreme violence and sexual perversion. That would not be too bad - I love violence and delinquency as much as I like the next reviewer, but without the context for putting it, it is repellent. So you make it through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film turns into something completely different - not better - quite different: a picture of a heartless road. There are lame attempts for comedy thanks to embossing - widely written and widely played by Brodys like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stoll (and a few prostitutes and royalty withdrawals, too). They all deserve the best. Photography is unintentionally confused, so if you are suffering from motion sickness (or really any kind of illness) - this flick is not for you. Come to think of it, I'm not sure who is the only person who is hard on this show, except maybe S & M gay and lesbian fans who like indie bad writing, bad filming about themselves.
