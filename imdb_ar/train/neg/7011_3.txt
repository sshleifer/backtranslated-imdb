Unless you understand the super miserable, this movie will not mean much to you. An attempt was made to introduce part of humanity into a period of cold and gloom consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayek tells you the big disco number, her voice is very clear and it was called pathetic - the producers at least had a remote-sounding person. <br /> <br /> The documentary on TV recently is much better and provides a more accurate view of that period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mickey Myers, can be charged with acting; however, he does an incredible job.
