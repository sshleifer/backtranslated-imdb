I can not see why filmmakers are making this film again. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic film. Steve McQueen was a prominent actor, and Baldwin represented only an inappropriate representative. He has no passion for his play. The procedure in the original "getaway" was also great. But the new edition has no work! It is almost boring despite the fact that filmmaking in 1972 was more difficult than it was in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think there was no need to reproduce it, or if they decided to remake a classic film, they should choose an excellent actor for the first stage, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
