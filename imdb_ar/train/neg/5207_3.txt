Anime comedy drama, seemingly unhappy and rushed along with Cher's role as a housewife in the Webguni, slowly makes friends with the successful man hired by her husband to kill her. Chazz Palminteri, as a borrowed gun, adapted the script from his own play, with stunning compositions and a round-the-clock dialogue that quickly tires between the eye and the ear. There is an atmosphere of gloom over the entire project, and director Paul Mazurski can not get Sher out of the permanent funk (she is without conscience). Despite all the great talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), the "faithful" fraudsters, without any content for the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
