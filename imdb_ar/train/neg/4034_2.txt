Oh my God. The cast is good, but writing and directing is the art of writing wit and straight is a bit of a task. So do a good comedy for you to get the timing and the right moment. I did not put all that down there where there were parts I laughed at but it was loud in very few times. The main focus for me was the fast-flowing dialogue, which made some people in the film annoying. It might sound great while reading the script in your head, but taking it out to the camera is a different task. The work of the hand-held camera gives energy to a few parts of the film. The overall trend was good but the script was not all that for me, but I'm sure you've read the script in your mind, it may sound good. Sorry.
