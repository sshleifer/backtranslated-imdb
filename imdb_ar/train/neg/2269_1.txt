Let's make a film about an existing talk show that basically has everything going on at the show! Well, if the idea does not interest you, it should not keep him away from the ringmaster. I was resentful of seeing it in the theater and being able to sit in the mess of the film. I think Jerry Springer does not play himself as he shows from the cheap props to his show (yes it seems cheaper than the real Jerry Springer show) and is known only as Jerry in the film. The plot (if you can name it) revolves around a daughter while she decides to live with her mother to start sleeping with the mother living in her boyfriend. So the idea of ​​a wonderful mother is to invite Jerry Springer as well as get her boyfriend with her daughter. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a garden trailer). Meanwhile, elsewhere in America, a woman finds her man cheating with her boyfriend in bed. So of course call American Wizard Jerry Springer! I was talking about the rest of the film but even thinking about the movie now gives me a headache. Jimmy Presley, who plays the role of the daughter, looks unattractive in the film. Remember Michael Dudikoff Kick Ass Karate Master of the American Ninja Series? Well take a look at it now as a drunk white trash. The thing is that he seems really terrible and can not call it "communicating with his partner". But if your idea of ​​pleasure is to see Jerry Springer singing a rural song about his own program or about guys connecting transgenders ... well ... watch the show live! ... At least, Steve was smart enough to stay away from this flicker.
