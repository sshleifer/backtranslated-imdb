Using this film, Bonwell deals with the viewer with all the force of the film while clearly showing in the film that his work is "objective". Obviously it is not. For one reason, many of the scenes that were "shot by a rare opportunity" are clear formations (when this poor goat "accidentally falls" off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoking on the right of the screen!). On the other hand, he was hiding important information: the people who were in Horus were the way they were for a specific reason was hinted at in the film. That is, thyroid hyperplasia, a disease caused by iodine deficiency (salt). Thyroid gland is the cause of their faith. Bonwell spent his research only (see, if he examined "Cretan" in a medical dictionary and found "thyroid hyperplasia"), he ended up telling the truth about these people (no doubt). Instead, with his film, he constantly rules them, and speaks of them as "Cretians", over and over again, reviewing the movement, preparing scenes to create the scene, all this is very unacceptable for a documentary that claims to work for a strong objectivity. Bonwell talks all the time in this film, without leaving a word to the people who portray them. Talk about them, and even then, judge them. This piece is flawed to its roots, and for an ideology and a real sense it is considered a wonderful film.
