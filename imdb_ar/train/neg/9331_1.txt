Are we talking about the same film? This movie is completely ridiculous, and the plot is totally disgusting and without logic. It's a direct example of a DVD / TV movie, including all the ingredients needed for an awesome movie experience: it was over-represented by actors, just steps away from the plot that was not explained, THE GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts (Why, God, why?), People do not react to things as they do in real life. I will not bother you with details, but it will take us all night. Well, well, just one: if two people are killed in front of you as you walk down the street, and one of the victims actually dies in your hands, his blood is bleeding from the wound of his head all over you. Will it be your first concern? Be; "Oh, left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost journey.
