You try to replay the movie twice. I put in three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's voice change? Did he die while filming and the studio had to knock the sound with someone who did not look like him? Or is the audio on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the voice of the real actor. Although in most of the film, the sound seems to have been recorded in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if you have a copy. I've hired it, but I will not do it again. I will check this database before renting any of his films, which were all (more or less) good films. You usually know what you're getting when you watch Steven Seagal's film. I think this is nothing more.
