I do not know anything about the writer or director earlier, so I did not present any prejudices to the film. Based on the brief description of the scheme in the TV guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the lack of credibility lies in unreasonableness. It seemed that every turn in the plot was an excuse to draw more bloodshed, make-up or special effects. <br /> <br /> The result was professional and Carrie and Harrar seemed to be a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. It was disgusting. <br /> <br /> I will not dwell on the vicissitudes of the narrative, but I will give an example of what I think is a surplus of clear tone. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated farmhouse and pulls the body of his former victim (Windt) from the deep cold. McKenna was killed and was killed by cutting part of his neck. Now he feels that he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in the demise of Went. (What will the police do, measuring the radius?) McKenna unclipsed the head and neck of Wendt from his freezer bag, takes the ax, and begins to cut Wendt's head. whack. whack. whack. Keep the ax cutting piece away from Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets of frozen flesh, one of which falls on the head of Makina. (He cleaned it when he did). Makina then takes the frozen head out to a small fire he has built. Sitting on the floor, squatting next to her, she picks up some pictures of a woman just killed, and shows her on Wendt's head. "I remember it, we could have made it really if it had not been for you guys," he says to his head. "Duke, I've always loved fire, right?" Ask. Then he puts the head on the fire. We get a glimpse of just burning it, but we can hear the sizzling fat in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want to monitor this kind of garbage. I just wonder who enjoys seeing these things. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to go ahead with the rest of the movie. Well, I will mention one example of "unreasonableness" since I put up the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and imprisoned in a dark naked hut. He knows he will fail half to death in the days to come. (I have literally called the heavens to do it.) What would you do in this po-like situation? Here's what McKenna does about what might turn into the last night of his life. He finds a poor evaluation with a girl who is fixed on him and masturbates (successfully). Give this man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster like Pizza Hut is thrown into some of the unnecessary memories of the past. The camera is often hand held. The dialog box contains lines like "Life is part of ***, otherwise it's the best in all possible worlds." That depends on your point of view. " A wide angle lens is used that turns normal faces into gargling masks. A house blows up an explosive fireball at the end as the hero walks, throwing us in the lead. <br /> <br /> Some hero is also. He first killed a man for $ 13,000 by beating him over the head with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally turning the refrigerator over to the body. (This bothers him a bit, but not enough to stop him from insisting on paying.) Then, I hope I have a straight order, he kills Wendt by ripping part of his neck. Then the wife of his first victim is killed by chance and blames the heavens for that, although almost no account of ethics has anything to do with him. After that, Honshu (Baldwin) is alive. Then, after disabling the two young men, he deliberately detonated them, although one of them was not entirely sympathetic. We are supposed to root McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not animated deaths like those in Dirty Harry's movies either - bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first - the killing of $ 13,000 - is made clumsy enough to resemble what might happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another person, as Hitchcock has shown in the Torn Curtain. But this scene does not lead to any significant place. <br /> <br /> Some people may enjoy this, especially young enough to believe that pain and death are only happening in movies. Some meretricious stuff on the screen here.
