I will keep this short; thanks to Greg to help me put this briefly: the captive revolves around a man trading a girl's drink, imprisoning and torturing her, then posing as a prisoner to have sex with her. This is one twist and punchline of the film. It's torture as rape is a slow rape date. And it's not even a good movie. It's not too bad it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that among critics, the "spoiler code" does not dare to break it, although some have been tempted by this code because it is very despicable. Why did not anyone have pupils to say "this is trash, that's why," outside of me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these hawkers.
