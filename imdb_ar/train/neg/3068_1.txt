Such films are due to the original assets represented by Orient Rock's music stations to the music they used to be like - frequent, boring and exhausting to all original energy by a committee of unmanned aircraft companies. I am glad that Aragorn was not typecast as a psychologist expected by these P.O. Go back and see the 1971 version, count things that will never be included in a recent version, and thank any god who worships that someone somewhere in the distant past has the balls to write and film an original concept that was not based on someone else's ideas and was not passed through Board of Directors before seeing daylight.
