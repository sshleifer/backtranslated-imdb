When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda work again. Although Serbia and its national policy are the main cause of the Yugoslav collapse, it is not mentioned in this documentary, directed by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film is far from being objective. It is one of the lies set by the Milosevic regime. Everyone is guilty Only the Serbs were right and victims, although most of the war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, although the Serbs committed genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all the independent states recognized by the Yugoslavia could not be divided because the Serbs did not want to release their grip on the Yugoslav federal government, so Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent states to protect their interests. They are interested in an objective documentary about the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the fact that the documentary he led is not the case. You should see "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation" produced by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
