This abandoned movie is about three million wealthy people who collect a handful of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, the representation is terrible, and the film makes no sense at all. It's not scary at least, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it got one star. The film is not violent at all, but it is very playful and focuses mostly on women's breasts all the time, and some characters are very annoying and pure. In addition, the monsters in this film are cheesy and fake and are not so scary that you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is very bad. I do not want to give up, in case you are actually strange to see this unwanted piece. Avoid at all costs !!!!! <br /> <br /> It has not been evaluated (but must be R) for nudity and obscene words and Mild Gore.
