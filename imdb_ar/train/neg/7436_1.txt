This movie is a waste of time and money. For the hour and a half, I kept waiting until it got better and did not happen. The move was slow, the plot jumped, it was not scary or interesting, and it never reached anything. The credits during the introduction were long and drawn, which were basically like the rest of the film (long and drawn). Many parts of the plot are meaningless. Several times during the film I thought it was probably "determined" because of the plot inconsistency, but my companion had the same problem and assured me that I "did not get out" of boredom, but it was actually a movie. In fact I have never posted a movie here before, and I've been actively looking for movies on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I spend enough time writing something, you should talk volumes about how damaging this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money in it.
