I admit, after the age of majority in the Age of Hippies, I sucked on this kind of movies. I can enjoy some kind of hippie much more than most "natural" people. However, this film is simply horrific in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> Every vulgar portrayal of Hippy's absurdity is presented as a gospel, when police officers kill young, long hair when they land safely aboard an airplane. This movie is so horrible that it is not funny to see it as over-the-top in the drone hippie transgressions. Similar to the left version of Dragnet, except for professional reps. The only reason I gave it to two stars was that there was some ambiguity in the interest in soundtrack, besides, I could not find a selection of negative stars. <br /> <br /> There are no actors, no plot almost, or laughter, barely even a script ... I got it, an "art" movie .... all this was done in the slow digging of the root canal, pulling every scene Meaningless just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A strange development of imitative music, the star "Nonactor" joined the film into a real-life group and stole a Boston bank. One of his hunting colleagues was killed and sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious "incident" lift. .... and just thought, got to leave this thing as a legacy .... Oy vey.
