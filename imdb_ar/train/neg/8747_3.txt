AntiTrust could have been a great way for Rachel Lee Cook, but the director cut off the best of them. The scenes in which they are, are just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot similar to a sub-plot in "Get Carter", but she deals with the sub-plot better in "Get Carter". The director was honored to Hitchcock smiling. (It's the scene where Ryan Phillip discourses that he may not be able to trust Tim Rubin's painter, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows the scenes that have been cut, I think the director has to trust his instincts and not listen to audiences the test.
