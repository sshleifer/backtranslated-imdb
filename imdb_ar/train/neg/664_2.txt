I am not particularly fond of reproductions, or to steal "rephrases" of modern terminology, but this film shocked me. The original prom night, although it is not in my humble masterpiece, still recognizes what was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Thrill is critical to maintaining public interest. Sorry people, but white knuckle film this was not! Concerns were cheap, and horrified. (A good example of the horror that has been done for the excess cliches now, is the cat that jumps out of the closet, followed shortly after but after an unexpected appearance now by the villain of the film) this film was unable to pull it off successfully, so how do I expect that Check out any of the other conventions of the horror movie. There must be a hero or a heroine. This movie does not contain one. The person I knew most was the head informer. His demeanor was quiet, but going toward the level of escape from the killer is what should have more films of this kind. Approach common sense to events that occur. (If you are running from a psychic ax, you spin and turn in the opposite direction, do not sprint, look back for about three seconds, achieve killer progress, only for a journey through each branch and an abnormal object on your way.) , You are not looking for it alone. If you suspect playing deceptive, tell someone, and do not investigate yourself. These clich√©s are tired and overpriced. In this kind of horror in general, and in this film in particular.
