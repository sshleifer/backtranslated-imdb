I bet none of you knew that Conquistador Hernando Cortis made an initial expedition to Mexico before the Aztecs. He did something good because he never knew about T Rexs, who lived in a certain valley where people respected them as gods. <br /> <br /> It was understandable. Unless he is casting blue eyes Ian Zering in Curtis. Even with the famous blond hair in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked ridiculously positive. At least, he did not make any attempt at the Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The true hero of Tarantosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also in the late TV series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. He finds true love for Princess Aztec, and life would be perfectly perfect if these were not the original beasts of prehistoric worship. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca appears to have used some of the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series Lost Land. All that was required was the appearance of Sleestak. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in discovering this expedition that did not make history books by any standards, see Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try to sit through a straight face.
