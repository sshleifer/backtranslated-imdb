I saw this film for the first time today and I never heard of it, perhaps because of its bad message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the guidance itself is very good, the actors have played well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is fantastic. But this alone does not make a film. No story at all, no message behind the beautiful talents exploited. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to remember people, the director's art is not just your vision but how to tell the story. That is what it lacks every 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple classification 4.
