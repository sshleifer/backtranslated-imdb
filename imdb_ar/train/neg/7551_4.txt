Well, finally saw the new version last night in London, Farhana inadvertently, without sex, free from any real humor. I do not really know where to start, while I enjoyed this strange honor, but it did not really move me. The play is screaming, there is no original music, fashion is very far from Disney, there is a story "Six months later" ridiculous after the burning of Nick Cage (who did not come close enough to Ltroki) with Cage in the Bear suit the audience was suppressing mirth as well as Comedy that penetrates many of the "bad guys" on the island. It's a weird new edition that I can not believe I saw. It reminded me of something the Comic Strip made in the 1980s, just like the Hollywood interpretation of the miner's strike, so weird!
