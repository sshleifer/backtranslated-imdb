I went to the screening of this film, and while I was having moments of laughter, it had some big flaws. First of all he presents himself to be the humorous exploits of an absolute real life trying to find love in Los Angeles. What turns into is a blues, narcissistic, and non-funny through the life history of the film director and career. Dress up jokes quickly and find yourself suddenly not interested in the progress of this man. The irony is that the director presents himself at the same time as a very disturbing and severely flawed character and therefore we are expected to be concerned.
