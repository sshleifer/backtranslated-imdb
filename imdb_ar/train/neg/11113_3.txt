I often feel like I'm Scrooge, criticizing movies that others care about - or writing a review to balance unwarranted batons. I found that this movie was almost unreachable, and it was unusual for me, a quick rerun not only through a dull and smiling dialogue but also a dull musical. Whatever the originality of this film - an unusual local environment of music, a lot of imagination, and some animation - is compensated for by more than one text that does not contain an ounce of intriguing plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but they can not carry a movie as a team. No is really charismatic or has a lot of sexual attraction. Both are cute. I love Billy Gray, but his personality is beautiful. The best part of the film, to me, is the beautiful June Haver fashion and its wonderful body.
