It's a film by Robert de Niro that I really hate. It's a stupid film with terrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian de Palma must perform Mafia movies as always, such as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also liked De Palma's mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma twice twice, greetings and weddings. I even though the wedding was fine too (I did not see my greetings). <br /> <br /> The movie script is really bad and unfamiliar. There is no scene where I can smile even once. The film has an opportunity to be a funny way even in the scene "Be Black" and also do not like the scene where the sexual organ of someone appeared. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Only worse. I hate that.
