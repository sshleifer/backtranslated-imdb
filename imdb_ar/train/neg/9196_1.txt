This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it looked like a comedy. First, there is no conspiracy. Actors seem to read cue cards and perform the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but wanting to go out and search for their friends. The zombie was also awful, as there is no fun near like any Romero work, which gets the film. The most obscure part was keeping flashes of video game in the sequence of events. Like we do not get a video game revolving around zombie launch. Also, every 20 somethings some know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming a gun. The way people die is very stupid. It's like they're running out of ammunition, so wait until you wait. When they are in front of the house they run out of ammunition instead of shooting at the door, so stupid. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, they are blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. B-Movie on the best cinema.
