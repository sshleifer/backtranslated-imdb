I thought this was a really bad film - I found myself screaming in my TV several times. One or both gay male leads were miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry in what Richard Rococo seemed to prefer to kiss a dog. The film covers the long and tortuous engagement period, highlighting each process of disassembly and makeup, but does not develop interstitials in any detail. These reasons make some interesting characters, not battle or make-up scene in bed (lame even if you love the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg star as two characters, but do not make the film worth leasing. Save your money.
