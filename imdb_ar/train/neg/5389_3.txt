If you've seen other films like this, it's probably better. Omega man comes to mind. In addition to the studios, they have avoided the extensive and unnecessary technofest and large budget that show films of this kind. In addition, the setting and assumption were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from a deadly disease. What's bad is everything else! I am fed up with stupid, infinite, attractive, attractive, ineffective and arrogant characters in the film. To describe everyone in the film to some extent at some point. I rented it and found myself screaming at the TV over and over, "No, do not do it!" , "Why are you so stupid", "Watch out!" , Etc. There is clearly a real lack of personal development. A film should give you a strong personal connection with at least some characters to really care about what happens to them. This one does. Also, there should have been a longer end, involving more film as well.
