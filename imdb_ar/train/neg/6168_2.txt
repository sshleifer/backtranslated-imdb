Well, evaluation of IMDb 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... Well, two of my friends and I, we ordered a pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as wonderful as Ichi or at least something eccentric but funny like Versus. But naked blood sucked. It's a complete waste. Well, the scene with the woman you love is very cool. But that's it. No more, no less. I would not imagine this plot, others did already, just wanted to stop the noise. But watch it and rate it for yourself. Maybe we can pay the rating where it will be. Something else comes to my mind: the sound is worse than Carpenter ever was - well, cool John ... :) 2/10
