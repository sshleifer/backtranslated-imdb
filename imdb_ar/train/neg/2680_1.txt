Brokedown Palace is not the type of film I would like to see. I also did not like the film when an Australian man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Dennis and Kate Beckinsell of drug trafficking. I will not go to this country no matter what I saw after this film. In fact, this film stinks. Best visit to Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I would also like to stick to the United States instead. After seeing some movies in the theater including the wrong charge of drug trafficking, I left the theater and recovered my money because I can not afford this film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone who can be a drug trafficker, forget this!
