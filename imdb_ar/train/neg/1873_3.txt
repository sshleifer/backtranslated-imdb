you are kidding!!!! Let us contemplate the possibility that Parker Posey is truly representative, and not just a participant in the "month club" of actors. Indeed, unless it was meant to be a satanic spell in the cheek on David Mamet - a confusing and confusing dialogue handed over alternately by the speed of machine guns or monotony (Think Ben Stein) - or a dry comedy. This film should be nominated for Rotten Tomato --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the tough and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have become more solid and more comfortable. Jeff Goldblum. In this film there is more wood than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this strange representation already, there are many other roles, inhabited by all forgotten actors, who resemble or appear to be escaping from Next Top Model, Don Bardot, or even the child, "Such as" beans ", which draws our attention to the fact that there is very little that you like in this film, we analyze his tone to guess whether Canadian or not !! I think I laughed warmly in places that are supposed to be serious, and I took seriously the sections that are supposed to be humorous. Even the soundtrack looks like a caricature of Alarik Jans' music for "The House of Games" for Mamit. If it is considered a parody, the film will almost end; if taken seriously, just a piece of self-conscious.
