It's amazing to me what's going on for today's entertainment. Maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, I'm in touch with the current generation of film movies, and that seems to be the case with regard to this film, because so many people liked it. I found it foul and obscene. I did not say so about many movies in my life but this film fits the bill. Your sense of humor I am not a politically correct person, so I found anomalous jokes, not only not funny but expressive attack (I am not an exception). The main character in the film is not even a lovable person, just pathetic. When the film ended in the end, I heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were with the money.
