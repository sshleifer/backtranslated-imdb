Almost Spider Lillies are almost in the same league as the awful Yonfan Color Blossoms, leading the house to the point where you can make sophisticated cinema without the edge, or much in the way of cutting. It is a Taiwanese film, which in this age and age has become a novelty at an alarming pace, but more than that tale, we can find very little in the way it is worth mentioning here. <br /> <br /> Spider Lillies must also be known as a lesbian story, but on each side, this is just a plastic trick to attract them to temptations easily and naively. In several ways we have here repeated the issue of Taiwan's recent colleague Eternal Summer. Then gay men were getting reductive treatment, and now we have the same thing with women. Zero Chou, for your non-enlightenment, offers a tale that is likely to tickle at the age of fifteen at most. They managed some of the art house's position, but in the end, it resulted in an overwhelming invasion of more than just interests. <br /> <br /> The angle of Hong Kong in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Memoirs), here sports has a partial look so far. Although somewhat likable in its previous functions, Isabella in Spider Lillies lacks strength and lacks most sections. Either her heart was not there or the entire Lesbian drama did not appeal much to her sense. <br /> <br /> She works as an artist and tattoo artist in shy, shabby Taipei and is responsible for his younger brother, who faces a mental challenge, played by John Shane, who happily gives the film its only recovery feature. The Isabella character, who is strangely named "Takiko," but is supposed to come from Hong Kong, quickly clung to disaffected young men (Rene Yang from the meteor park retrieved by the superiors). She lives with her grandmother and has a full list of grievances because of her lack of parents and life in general. Certainly the novelty element works well and touches, but otherwise, the Jade as protagonist is not affected like her counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> In the past, both women share a lot of undetected anxiety, with Jade acting as a webcam girl, while Takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of the spider night adorned on her arm. Jade also wants to get this particular design, which leads to exploring Takeko's inner feelings of the cause through past memories and a little bit of rhetoric with the brave Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little speech to write homebet base about, is at least a memorable intercourse? In a word, no. They accept and pretend to do something bad near the end, but as Eternal Summer has stated not so long ago, there is a gap measured by the mild year between showing sexual content and making buyers think they are about to see sexual content. <br /> <br /> This cynical prediction ends up building the fate of Night Spyder. With a weak story, modest representation, and the overall scarcity of effects that make you away from the stage, this type of species makes Blossoms look good and thought about it. At least, we got a little of the Teresa Cheung mammals. No, Spider Lillies is not considered a masterpiece of vehicles, and should be included in the playlist for the most boisterous festivals and timing. <br /> <br /> Impressively through a pseudo-pseudo version, not even the soundtrack and the cinema that produce moments of inspiration. This is also so, because it makes traffic on Spider Lillies much easier. Believe it, avoid it and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
