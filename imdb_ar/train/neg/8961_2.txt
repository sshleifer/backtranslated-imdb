This movie was another waste of time ... Why oh why I keep renting nonsense like this? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * good. The Cube Zero is worth it if you really enjoy the first movie (just like I did) and just want to check out the latest events in the movie (hopefully) that were just assembled together to keep some poor actors and screenwriters working , Then of course this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with a good representation and a wonderful plot ... * Sinister smile * This movie is definitely for you: -D .... well, I'm lying ... at best, suck this movie. Well, I have to admit that some of the items were cool .. well .. cool ... I laughed many times, and I talk about the wrong things, but I was enjoying. :-) But in all the few things that hardly make the "OK" category is not enough to make this movie worth it at all .. unless "Manos - Hand of Fate" is no longer one of the top 10 movies ever!
