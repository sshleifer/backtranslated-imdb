Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a documentary that shows you how! Yes ... the child eats live worms! It's about the most interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> This film has been well summarized by previous reviewers as somewhat boring. I agree here completely. The movie does not go anywhere .... unless you are fond of worms! This one film is almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because there is nothing much. <br /> <br /> Now on the artistic side: they should have given this child a hair story. Who is that tries to look like anyway ... Bozo clown. It was almost comedy ... I was expecting him to turn into a shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> On top of that; the child was a very chunky way to look hungry ever! It should have kept him away from junk food for a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie made me sleep. My children could only handle 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the scene was very impressive. If there is a decent story to go with, it could be a great success. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for the kids to watch: the bear's sights and the strange eyeballs were too weak to frighten most of the children, and the short "slim" scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> We have given this one Karma 3.
