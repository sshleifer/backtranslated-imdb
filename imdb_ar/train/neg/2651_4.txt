The first 30 minutes of the click was volatile and it was hard to know what was going on (unless you read the book - which I had not done). <br /> <br /> If you can commit to the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but not resolved at all. <br /> <br /> The way they were shot might be thought to have been produced in the early 1980s, not 2005. <br /> <br /> There are no memorable moments, but nice, but they moved without feeling bored. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, and it was better to play her role with more player-level other players to maintain balance.
