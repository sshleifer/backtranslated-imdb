The only redeeming qualities of this film are fairly original death scenes. Otherwise this film is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, a besieged housewife slowly sloping through the local commercial center for the first 30 minutes. Of the film, which added something. After that, the film picks up a little bit as he has a four-kicks encounter that operates two parking spaces on Christmas Eve. They began chasing her after leaving the local security guard who tried to help her. From there, this film gets worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the flow but it got about 5 minutes. Hartstart and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, drive to a half-built section next to the forest. In a typical way, she does her best to let her followers follow her easily. But now they turn into one tough mofu. You get this point. Under no circumstance will you buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like it. It is very illogical that you will ask every scene. It is embarrassing for Basinger, Craig Scheffer and the rest of the actors, as well as consumers.
