I have also seen this film, and although it has been done very well, I found it to be very sensitive and would not recommend this to women with young children. This horror on the face of this mother when she sees her child about to run the train is truly tragic. The sad thing is - you die internally. Eventually you return to the Appalachian Mountains. All the money she earns from making puppets in the world does not hide her grief. I remember her desperate face as she pulled the money out of her clothes to try to heal her child. I'm surprised that this movie happens in Detroit, because when I saw it I thought people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a route for the poor from the mountains.
