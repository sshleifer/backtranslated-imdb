This film is representative and difficult to watch and acted by loyal fans, produced by some exploiters. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie at all, but at least a movie like Outer Space_ _Plan 9 is usually a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to Hardcore Hardcore and Hard Dispensationalists. I'm not like this. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me? Watch it for free (despite its poor source of VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Related links are mostly added to IMDb's 10 -line Minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
