I will not describe the story, as it happened elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen lovers, and when Netflix recommended the film, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we did not hear about this "movie" because it was a BBC television movie in 1992. Hence, the production values ​​are weak, the image is likable, the camera action is jerky, and the sound is weak. /> <br /> But, you do not really mind the mechanics, because the same story will take you. It is an interesting human story, but it is not convincing at all, and there is hardly any end. You do not really care about characters because their lives are as boring as you see your life this hard movie. Save two hours and do something to make the time more feasible.
