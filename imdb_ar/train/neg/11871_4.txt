The representation of Gregory Beck was excellent, as expected, and the cinema was so spectacular even when playing directly in a melodramatic "moment" but, the rest of the film was overrated and difficult to watch, for me anyway. I liked it, but I had to move quickly in the last 30 minutes or so. I feel like I'm wasting a few good hours. Lola Gregory Beck, I would not have taken 15 minutes. 10/04.
