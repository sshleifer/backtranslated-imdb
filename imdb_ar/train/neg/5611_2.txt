I personally found this movie awesome, first it was barely objective, and gave aside the discussion. The only people who have been presented as the side that he says he already exists are a group of people coming from Billy Graham's revival. Second, she drastically deviated from her supposed subject to the existence of Jesus (Joshua), to talk about the extent of violent Christianity, and to view the scenes of Gibson's "passion". In the end, the manager cheated his former manager of a private county school to interview him, and attempts to screw him up about educating children there is faith. Oh, as well as techno music has made the film more difficult to watch.
