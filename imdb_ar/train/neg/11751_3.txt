When Arnold! For the first time on air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite programs. Then the same episodes began to appear again and again, so I was tired of waiting for the new episodes and stopped watching them. I was surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! Movie "MOVIE" because it does not seem to be as popular as some other cartoons of Nickelodeon like SpongeBob boxes. However, after having nothing better, I went to see the movie anyway. Going to the theater, I did not expect much. I was just expecting to be a stupid movie version of a cartoon for kids like RECESS. I think I got what I expected. The KDE movie was mute and no more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie was stinky. Simply for children.
