Alan Alda is a real-time sports writer, George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Instead, the indestructible drama eased the stranger with imagination. Director Alex Marsh takes an interesting article on this article, dubbed it in a semi-documentistic manner (with muscular commentary) and gives a touch of a touch of Capraesque. However, by highlighting cinematic prowess in this collection, the main narration turns into a mixture. The performance of the arrogant and unambiguous performance is another obstacle, although the support team is full of real-life athletes (and Lauren Hutton glorifies as a friend of Aladda - how is that for fantasy?) * 1/2 of ****
