The massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (the burial ground) and the production of the legendary Italian director Lucio Folsi. Now with this combination of brilliant talent, you think this film would have been a real festival. This can not be further. The massacre is directly on her face as one of the most boring and courageous films I've seen coming out of Italian cinema. I was struggling to stay awake during the film and never faced this problem with Italian horror films. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with massacres that are slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used at the Folsi nightmare. This is not a bad scene and raises your expectations in the film as a vampire altar. Unfortunately, the next hour of the film is very boring. The film moves into a series of horror films that are filmed, and there is a great evolution in characters during all these scenes, but the characters in the film are very dim and you have been badly interested. The last 30 minutes of the film is not too bad but still can be much better. The bull in the film was pathetic and because Folsi used most of the scenes at a "nightmare" concert there was nothing new here. The end of the film did not leave a nice touch, but there were still many unanswered questions and continuity flowing straight across the floor. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good film but it was obsessed with real Italian horror (like me) this film must be because it is very rare. 4/10 Stars
