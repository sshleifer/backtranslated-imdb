This movie has potential and I was willing to try it out, but there are many scheduling problems that are very obvious - it's hard to be swallowed like that stupid. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power was set in the late 1960s. Carlito's Way was developed in the mid to late seventies. In order for this film to be realistic, it must be shown in the 1950s, if not in the late 1940s. <br /> <br /> The Rise to Power tag does not point to Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), and there is no sign of Kleinfeld, there is no sign of Rolando that Carletto is supposed to have run with in "Hey". He was not one of the main characters in the original film in this film. We are supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people within a few years. <br /> <br /> "Rise to Power" ends with Carlito walking on the beach talking about retirement in Paradise which he wanted to do in the original film. Also, pre-test creates characters Rocco and Earl - what is supposed to happen with them because they are clearly not in the way of Carlito? It is also difficult to understand how Carletto could have a relationship with the Italians who had in the original film as they watched the Rise to Power events. Where is Taglialucci in this film? There may be seven years between the two films and five of them are in jail. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole. <br /> <br /> Obviously no one was interested in telling a good story and they were more interested in making some dollars by producing an average gangster film and a personal throw called Carletto Brigante in the story. The film had some good moments, but I think it would have been better to leave this film alone to try to convert it to Carly Way. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to watch this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the film as a linear step. Think of it as Westerners pasta with a Clint Eastwood man without a name, in other words two films of the same character but not necessarily linked to each other.
