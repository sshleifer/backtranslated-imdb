I agree with those reviews I've read here, and I do not have words to define such a turkey, but despite everything, I still can find the reason for such films. Do you remember those happy days when video was a thriving business, and many movies were produced with the only reason to fill video shelves? This film comes from that period, and I can imagine that this is the only reason it was produced, and the same thing happened with so many and many people belonging to foul products. Do you remember the tradition of Rambo? I still feel nostalgic for that period. About this film I can say that I did not waste my time watching it because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a funny scene where a man was pushing the ax against the heads that exploded because, as you can see, was made of plastic. And about the end, well, he was filmed very badly and I did not understand what happened. This is the same, I have not followed the conspiracy that does not exist at all. But the boy, the video era was a wonderful afternoon despite movies like this.
