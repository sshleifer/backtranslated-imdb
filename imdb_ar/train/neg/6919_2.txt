My roommate and I almost reduced our television through many of the exciting things we did while watching this fun piece of the 1970s that was of interest to you. I read about this camp for ages and I scanned local TV listings late at night in search of this elusive mob. Several years ago, our local ABC company was known to show a cold snap because of its late weekend finches (like "frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then something happened one day: 1:40 on Saturday morning (more than 5 years ago) was there! We had more than 15 people and did not disappoint the flick! <br /> <br /> Watch! Andy Griffith as the worst and most dangerous person since Jay Davidson in Stargate! <br /> <br /> Watch! William Schattner plays a variety of things on his head just like the ugly human hair (or anything organic in the matter). <br /> <br /> Listen! The sudden jaw of the 1970's hurdle that makes Chicken Soup for the Soul look like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> I feel! Content that any contract was better than the 1970s of the last century. <br /> <br /> For those who still read ... the plot is surrounded by a bunch of middle-level middle class - the loopholes you decide to absorb. President (Griffith) by joining him in the paddle race across California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, looking for Christopher Street more than anything else. Along the way they stop in Cantina, fill up, smoke the smoke joints (the scene of Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes Reed is a picture you will never forget), never fight, try raping, and just act like a bunch of middle-class suburbs. Although I have an excellent copy that I've recorded on TV, I hope this video is released on the video, so the whole world can enjoy its half-baked rope.
