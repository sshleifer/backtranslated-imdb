Dukes Hazard wonderful achievement ?? A $ 53 million movie is worse than any particular episode of a 25-year-old television show. The plot is serviceable enough but rarely found in the irrational pleasure and the castle is very heinous: Johnny Knoxville is the most famous traveler of the protagonist, MC. Shirev Rusko of Gainey is a nice incest, and Michael Wiston's Enos, Willy Nelson, apparently the perfect designer, seems waiting for the check to clear and Bert Reynolds, stuck in some sanitizer where he is doomed to restore his old movies, is a curious choice for Bos Hogg to say the least But he has a good moment with an invoice and a hundred dollars. Do you know that a film is in a bind when both Sean William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the two most personal television screens? But the worst of the script or acting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: he seems to have been born without a sense of comic timing, unable to do more than two basic shots tirelessly about how to launch a car chase, let alone the right couple. Thriller In the film, it seems that he is determined to drain the film from any signs of life before it is realized. There are a few wonderful postmodern moments revolving around Confederate science and the typical Daisy role in each episode, but there is no film that makes you shine in the days when Hal Nedham directed this kind of thing (and bad) could be a good thing.
