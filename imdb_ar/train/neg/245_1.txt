Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, but it keeps my heart in love because of its own poverty and the amazing track of sound in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest, that's all you need to see) I met to produce something What joy of my side. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in "Space" can not be understood exactly as it does in cinematography, while liquid laundry bottles pass through your eyes until they become chained. Before you have time to work out whether you are crazy or not, the credits will succeed and the movement is struggling for life. <br /> <br /> Apart from the giant snail of two-headed plastic that horrifies our heroes, you also get a double reward added from the presence of both original actor voices and dubbed sounds at the same time. A pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this type of fare is that I have only seen one copy, so the chances of seeing it yourself are very unlikely. I may have the only version available. <br /> <br />
