This was the worst film I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a collection of recycled materials. People in the head are not funny. People kicking is not funny. After the third time that a man in a man's balls, no longer even the youngest member of the audience laughs. I was tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She laughs loudly at King of the Hill, but this movie masterpiece was bored. I'm not surprised. The story is very lame. The dwarf thief steals the big diamond in what was certainly the easiest robbery in the history of Hollywood. He then hides with a family pretending to be a child. I know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you will get the picture. There were a lot of jokes expected. I felt really ripped off after seeing this. I did not expect much and I am still disappointed. I hope Kenan will hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or the next scenario. This was worse than white chicks if possible. I have seen plays in high school have been better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this film. I do not like to omit my entertainment.
