"Masters of Horror" has proven to be a "message loophole", and while Joe Dante's case for "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the series) can be worked out, most of the efforts to do so have come across a lot of anvil And impressive (nothing fades more terror than a soap box). The "pro-life" simply incorporates the reactionary views with extreme violence; the small Angelique (Keitelin Watts), seen as she wanders through the forest, has injured two doctors (Mark Fuerstein and Emmanuel Fugier) who were driving to the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perleman), is a cool holy reel at the far right and will do anything to prevent his daughter from aborting. If nothing else, Pro-Life has gathered some buzz for its controversial problem, but John Carpenter deals with this whole project with astonishing indifference - it seems less interested in making a film of the same text (which is poor) Lead to any tension, and simply lead to a conspiracy already. Even when Dwayne and his children break into the clinic, where the guns are set on fire, this is not a startling event; later, when the doctor is tortured through "male abortions", the scene appears unnecessary and unnecessary - in an effort to get the film out. The weak performances (Perlman here is sadly lost) as a result of the scenario, and Carpenter's feeling is exhausting, as if ProLife is the source of the next hot meal. By the time the spider creature has a human head and a man in a late-night brutal suit roams the corridors, you just have to wonder what minds are thinking behind this chaos ...
