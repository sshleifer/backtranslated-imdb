Even for the cocaine that the 1980s overcame, this is pathetic. I do not understand why someone wants to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells for the public to make such a leadership. If you're going to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to photograph such a trash, keep it to yourself. If you will issue them as a joke like this: NO !!! I mean, it was a joke? Someone please tell me this was a joke. Please.
