This is a very bad film. I laughed once or twice, sucking the story! Maybe there's one funny joke, it's stupid and boring. Through the whole short film, I was asleep wondering about the end date. <br /> <br /> No one behaves humanly, and everyone acts foolishly and stupidly. Rob Schneider behaving like a beast is not something I will pay to see him. It seemed funny, but the bottom line: do not waste your time at this time in a ridiculous and stupid movie. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it would end, although it's a short film. At first we thought it would improve; but it gets worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I came out of the theater and I would remember that the movie is very bad forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this movie is the Simpsons TV writer, but this is not like Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
