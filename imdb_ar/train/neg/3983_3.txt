Irene finished her illustrious journey with this film. She had to go out with a bang, being the stylish actress she was on, not in this memorable, unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is much better because it gets very stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and stop. Even her high-pitched voice became a little annoying here. Rumor says she was not happy with this film. One can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a television comedy in the 1950s. When I talk about it, I thought David Nelson of Ozzie & Harriet TV was in this film, but it turned out to be Richard Crane. He looked and looked just like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, at best, and effectively ends for a great actress.
