Horrible movie ever. Waste a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so high that you can not understand speech. Well, if you listen very closely, everything you talk about is really incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Camera work is bad, editing does not exist, the degree of background gives a headache, the procedure is lousy, the dialog boxes are incomprehensible, the behavior is very bad Well, Karina used to look like a wrestler and now looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can lighten but you can not get grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie I want to love, but this movie will not allow me this fun. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, look at this.
