This film was fine, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born this way", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and fall into the arms of another woman. It seems as if the sex kit gender preferences have been turned on and off like a switch, making this movie seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> Also, as is common in films that try to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproved of gay lifestyle were described as "fanatic." There was no happy way. It was either Kate's friends and relatives who completely embraced her or completely avoided her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-homosexual relatives and friends. It is usually a combination of feelings and values ​​that you consider. It is possible to love and treat people with respect, while not necessarily overlooking the choices they make. Unfortunately, the movie did not show any of these types of interactions. For a film trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, this film surprised me as a very unforgiving film! Then in the end, Kate decided it seems after all these years she wants to be with the Mac and everything is dory crazy - is this what is really being gay all about? Come on!
