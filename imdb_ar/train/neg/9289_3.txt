For those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original film, is your chance, then back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The man who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he is transferred to another prison, where the heroes roam in wrestling in search of the brood. Twitch plans to leave prison within a month to get gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and shoots someone, and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestling daughter is stuck in everything, so he goes and wiggles to find them and a Twitch woman. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the representation is less than par, featuring lots of (really annoying) rap, and bad fighting scenes editing. On the positive side, we note that a Hispanic origin is involved in him, who champions every prison / movement / excitement at all, and closes the door in this. <br /> <br /> It is not eventful, but at least harmless. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original, that's good. <br /> <br /> If this is not the case, you are warned.
