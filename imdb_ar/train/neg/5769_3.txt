The dream of elephants was supposed to be the main project of the open source community. Although it was a very interesting idea in concept, it actually failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully presented, probably the only recovery factor. A big problem with them, however, is the vast excess of light prosperity. It's terrible, although I think it helps give the film a dream-like quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is the terrible voice representation. While the voice actor for Proog is at least quasi-qualified, the voice actor for Emo is terrible. I think when you have a budget basically up to zero, you can not hire real vocal representatives. To me they seem to have hired an animation to vote. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie does not go anywhere. To me it seems like a kind of "see what we can do" kind of movies instead of a real film. The plot does not go anywhere and fails to show any really important point. The entire film seems to have been presented as an excuse to make appearance areas interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be worth a quick download from the official website, but do not expect anything except the beautiful graphics.
