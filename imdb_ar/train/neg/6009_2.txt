What is it with the Americans and hanging them with the religious idiot? The belief that this was the best selling novel is unbelievable, but to capture it as a film, you really need a good representation and a cinematographer delivers. In this case, all the good actors went to heaven and we left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!) Trying to find out why so many people disappeared. Oh yeah, there is a sub-plot about the evil world conspiracy and famine, or something. The good news is that this is done cheaply, and with this unusual dialogue, he has tremendous entertainment value in all his unintended laughs. Not recommended for anyone with IQ 3 digits.
