The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire with a high degree of oil fumes and whiskey would have trouble understanding if someone shouted at the perfect parking lot. In short: the oil works in the cahoots with the government (or Gummint if you prefer), Gummint in the cahoots with tyrants in the Middle East, the CIA is a unique group of clowns from the sons of dual-ready deal (insert word) to the toe any line comes in Their way. The only people who have been accomplished are good people, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, terrorism is the result of poverty created by globalization when evil multinationals pursue the world in search of a delicious takeover or three. This fits well with the features of the perpetrators of the events of 9/11. <br /> <br /> In Sereana, this translucent fabric of half the political facts and stereotypes in Hollywood is moved in a hateful dictionary of distorted storylines, circling around the gloopy surroundings because of their irrelevance until the poor scenes are left alone with The following conclusion: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not leave the "exit" (good joke) near the camera again <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hort may know how to act, but they certainly do not Know how to choose a script <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a film dealing with corruption in big corporations and the state, go to the film "L'ivresse du pouvoir" by Claude Chabrol, It is characterized by rich and funny and acting brilliantly. <br /> <br /> An emotional gap filled with mystery from inch to length was destroyed.
