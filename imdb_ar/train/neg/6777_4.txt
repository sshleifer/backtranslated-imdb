Although I recently made a positive PETTICOAT OPERATION review, I did not really like this film though there are many similarities in it. The two were made only a few years later, both starring Carrie Grant and both of them were World War II comedy. However, the tone and style of the movies were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, in general, looked like a cheaper film - with poor writing, little power and some very wide presentations - even when compared with OPTATION PETTICOAT. I think a lot of blame at least for this lies in the casting of Jan Mansfield. The combination of her abundant talent and limited acting ability made this budget film A seem like it came from a third-class studio. In addition, there was not much chemistry or energy in conjunctions with Carrie Grant - the actor who was generally loved by his grace and class. It is a kind of reconciling Sir Lawrence Oliver with Marjorie Min.
