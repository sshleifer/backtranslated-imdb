Let me be clear. I have used IMDb for years. But today I just went through the problem of registering on the site, just so I could give this film the lowest rating possible. I've seen hundreds of movies, some bad, some bad. However, I have never seen such disparity in pretense, incompetence, super-intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino was filmed rude as a princess, but totally unbelievable like Fuchion, a little boy. Fiona Shaw is always an amusing character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even than the unclear French play that is the source (Marivaux has not yet reached Hollywood and we have preserved it that way). <br /> <br /> To illustrate, for example, Leonette is a philosopher and a great and emotional scientist, who shows that she pours frantic chemicals from a flask into a flask, echoing the names of famous scientists. The romance between Agis and Princess played even smarter. For this purpose, the couple must get a joint "Clair Danes" award, which will be given in a just world for the sudden and unimpressive reinterpretation of the famous teenagers of literature as women in the 1990s (see Miss Les Miserables in Denmark). <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible conspiracy and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic awards in photography. For example, there are moments where a handful of onlookers fade in and out of the event, sitting on chairs, and watching the main characters. The manager wants us to realize that she adapted the play. Understand it. But this does not happen at all even in the film. At this point, seeing a crowd sitting on chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is horrifying and distracting. They look like some kind of horrible zombie crowd, who appear through the fog and fill us with awe. When you see the terrible song and the song that ends with this movie, you want to raise your masses of zombies and kill them all because of the serious injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> - Matthew Maguire
