I must say, I usually love horror movies that I have never seen ... However, this film was pathetic on my precious tastes. I am used to mysterious musk types ... but this particular film was lame. The representation was terrible (but meant a cornea (not meant for pun)) was nice). To complement it, the killer scarecrow was worse! Yes, maybe, when I first came out, there was a great delirium about it and people loved it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose appear, movies like this make films like Scarecrow look childish. If you want to spend a movie what time, choose this movie! Special effects are cheesy as heck. But considering that it is a low budget film, I can see somewhere where it will come from. This movie will remind you of "Children Of The Corn". Independent rock movies .... most of the time. So, if you want to see a scarecrow kill people with corn, or in a sequel, you're afraid to collide, these will be you.
