This movie was terrible. I could barely stay awake. I would not see this movie again if I was paid. The alleged horror scenes were too predictable and played on. There was really nothing about this film that would make it original or worth $ 7.50 that you paid to see it. Do not go to see it, do not rent it, and do not read about it online because none of these things will be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller has performed poorly, and should really be ashamed of herself to soothe her good name in this film. Shame on you Sarah because of your association with this terrible terrible film. Horrible movie, no need to see it ever.
