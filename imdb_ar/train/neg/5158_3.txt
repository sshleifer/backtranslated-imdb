Sometimes, doing something strange and contemporary is not always for everybody's benefit. Although I will admit that the design and understanding of the film were somewhat enjoyable, the implementation of these ideas in one identical story did not work. This film was too slow and useless, even Robin Williams could have saved the trash. Clearly, Barry Levinson's dream fell on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world from this slope.
