Well, how do you rate a film like that? Does it even have a truly cinematic value? It's a film trying to get close to being as fast as possible. Basically the entire film is just a group of men torturing a little girl. Not very attractive, moreover, is not too realistic. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is completely fake so it does not work as intended. And control all the smooth and fake appearance, as well as sounding. They often kick the ground, not the girl. Also the way in which the girl responds to all torment is beautiful. I mean if this is true, it certainly would have screamed. There is a lot of screaming in this film. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the low-budget film is a courageous attempt to try to achieve something shocking and realistic, in addition to origin and provocation, with very limited resources. You do not really think that this film had a big impact though at the time it was released, although it had to have achieved something good, since a total of six consequences were released after this film. This film is likely to be disappointing because of this film, although there are still some greedy people who will come out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
