I do not see many reasons to go into this film in great detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, the author and survivor of The Season in Hell, who was recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crane, to return secretly to Vietnam, taking photographs of American prisoners believed to be still held in terrible camps, Without involving the enemy. <br /> <br /> A great chance. What if it actually does not more than sneak, take pictures, sneak? Who will come to watch the film? <br /> <br /> It is a fundamental celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his muscles fit well swollen. (Which is oiled and swollen all the time). There are rites of black skin shredding, ugly guns and even ugly knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost fit like stallone muscles. The bow has been tested and, yes, it has enough beating to lead the bolt through the enemy front. The knife has been sharpened with gentle thieves. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of the prisoners of war were betrayed by one or two suits from Washington, and cynical politicians who could never bet even in the fist fight at the grammar school. No courage, you know? Just sit down with their feet on the table and drink a foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film is what you are going to do, but what you are planning to do is appreciated. Deliberately benefit from a myth that is popular in the mid-1980s that there are countless numbers of MIAs kept quietly in the miserable camps by the North Vietnamese. Bumper stickers were everywhere. (Edit our MIAs.) Why did they keep it? This was never the reason, but perhaps to turn prisoners of war into a slave labor force - in a country that had no resources at all but work. Or perhaps because of their propaganda value as a tool to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a captive, Rambo is treated in a medieval way by the North Vietnamese. He fell on his neck in the swine poo and then came out of his wrists, his muscles still displayed. Then, not satisfied with the Vietnamese who are without humans, a Russian officer is brought to play the role of Gestapo officer - "Vee haff vays of MAKING Remember." Rossi uses psychology and electricity, a kind of high-tech, not just dump the pig. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love." Another myth arose that veterinarians returning from Vietnam were spitting and cursing uniformly, which is why I think we elected many in Congress We have appointed others to high-level positions. The last three presidential candidates were losers from that group. At least, Rambo's room left aimlessly drifting open to the sequel, arrived in full swing. <br /> <br /> Action films have been brewed with Schwarzenegger, Willis and others because of the puzzle but Rambo is ruthless. It goes well through its imaginary ideological quagmire, and mercilessly kills, barely, barely able to speak. Speech is a sign of weakness.
