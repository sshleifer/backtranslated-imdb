I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it was released, because I was very impressed with the SNL. When my friend and I went to see him, people who were coming out of the early show were shouting, "Do not waste your money!" But of course we had to recognize ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there were a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most seemed to be able to be edited to a 1 hour show. It was very bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer appeared, many people got up and went out. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was just pressing people's buttons deliberately with this movie. Otherwise he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not need to waste your time watching it, it's very bad.
