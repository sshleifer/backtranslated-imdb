First seen on 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with a lot of ironic distortions. Despite the very talented cast, this film is highly predictable and reduces the audience's appreciation. The film audience is not stupid and I hope that it will not continue to fill the pockets of certain stars over and over despite what they are participating in. We believe that this film revolves around some of Connery's conviction against Capitol punishment at first, but it turned out to be only a standard, supposed for the public, mill mill, let us not overcome it, excitement. We are dragged to every silly key in the character, where they are photographed to us when needed in the story, and we are ready for this thing before it ends. Yes, there are some good things here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in the role of psychosocial support, but the story does not work from the beginning almost to the long-awaited end.
