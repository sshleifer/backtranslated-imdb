I disagree first, confidently and confidently with the user who is called "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious in his film. He personally gave the film in the show I saw in Chicago. He has worked on the film for years and is the first in a certain trilogy. "What is that?" Is Crispin Glover's attempt to film a technician like those who adore them by Herzog and Lynch etc. <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about this film years ago "Epic Pornography with Every Down Syndrome produced by Crispin Glover." When I finally came out I saw the trailer on the Internet and read the summary and I was squinting in my mouth waiting. ... I went to Chicago to see it and were very disappointed. If you go out the idiot, like grandma who smokes pot, dance dolls, he will leave for something much better, but it is only about 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words just watch the trailer, enjoy it, and let it go. There are some amazing photos, intersections and wonderful phrases, but their lack of focus amounts to disappointment.
