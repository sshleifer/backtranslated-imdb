from where we start? <br /> <br /> Amitab's son, Akshay Khana, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for more than 33 years ... <br /> <br /> A remote transfer to the sperm house? <br /> <br /> B) Ask a nice Pakistani guard to e-mail him? <br /> <br /> C) Do they allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani prisons? <br /> <br /> All of the above <br /> <br /> E) /> <br /> While they agreed to the text? <br /> 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) Want Khana - It's Yum, Yum, Delicious ... He seems to want it - who was not, right ?! (But I do not think this is a "spoiler" because you have to be dead and do not see this coming in the film.) He does not feel the passion for this disaster and the (figurative) side of his hat, "I'll get my dad d my job done, sorry for your loss - CYA!

In fact, the Veer-Zaara is very good - 7.5 / 8 I would like to say!
