I've been willing to carry a lot of thriller movies in late spring / summer, but in general it was due to the fact that most of them have a reasonable return (no special special effects, interesting plot changes, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This film, however, was none of this. All we got was a cheap thrill for a few minutes of Eva Longoria split (the Maxim case is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an awkward lack of intrigue, suspense, background stories, personal development, continuity and so on. I'll go into details, but frankly I've already forgotten most of the film willingly. <br /> <br /> All the time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself to not spend the afternoon watching the 24th season on a DVD. Save your money on this one, people. Unless they really are, really, like Eva Longoria split.
