My eyes! In the name of God and all that might make me bet in this film! What drugs do people on! This could be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad acid trip all the time, I needed to contact the therapist to help me deal with the shock of this epic disaster. From start to finish, incandescent chords are an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought about watching this movie with my best friend, the Jew and his family we thought, "Oh, this may be funny!" "Maybe it would be bad but it would still be funny to some extent." How wrong we were, we were not prepared for how awful this could be. All my friends lined up for lobotomies once the film was over. During the film, one of my friends tried to hang himself in his belt while the other tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I'd seen the video from The Ring instead, and that way the pain and suffering will end in just seven short days. For anyone who wants to watch this movie, you are not ready! You may think you are a "strong man" sort of by renting this but this movie will take you and push you to the ground and urinate on you.
