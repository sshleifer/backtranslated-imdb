I was lucky enough to see a "chorus line" when it came to my city. I was younger then. But it was an excellent play. Could you please tell me why they made a film in the name of heaven? Why Michael Douglas? Did not fit the role .. sucked this film really a great time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is not to rent this movie .. Save your money for something better like "cats" ....
