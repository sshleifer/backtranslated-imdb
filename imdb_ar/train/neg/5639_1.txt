I saw this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing the rave reviews, but I think the critics were absorbing William Defoe and his wife (the director) who attended the festival. It is definitely the slowest film I have ever seen with many senseless and long-ironed scenes of nothing. Along with Defoe, who was fit, two and a half others in the film, including Devo's wife, Gida, were ridiculously shocking (how they threw a part of the bakery vendor into an outside). This movie plot is much less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that raised any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and did not come from anywhere as if it was just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness of this film. Sorry for being too harsh, but this film is really a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate the good Indian cinema, but this film does not deserve the time of moviegoers.
