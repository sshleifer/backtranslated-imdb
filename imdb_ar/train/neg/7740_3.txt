This film actually managed to be a reckless 2/3 enjoyment of the trip. Unfortunately, the film ends up being "confused". Although I know that some of the rivalries in the plot are standard for "police friends" movies, they have been drawn to characters who frustrate each other brilliantly, but in the end the film relies heavily on chase chains such as crutches and lost interest. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own things, and we got to know who they were and knew with both police officers early on. We formed our own view instead of feeding them forcefully through constant bickering. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is a lot of going on and it greatly detracts from what could have been an enjoyable piece of escape. Here is Joe Gavillan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate deals 2. His relationship with a psychic radio 3. Being interrogated by internal affairs 4. Investigating the murder <br /> < If you add Casey's fears that you love most, he wants to be a representative and vengeful. The death of his father. Now some of these things are grouped together well, but all the elements of the scheme are gathering amidst this long and pathetic pesky pursuit so that I hardly have time to break ennui and give crap about what's just happening. Acrobatic action in scriptwriting can not overcome bad filmmaking. <br /> <br /> As if a chilling chase sequence was not bad enough, divided into four separate sections and could last about half an hour, it was not bad enough, the fields Joe Gavilan calls about a real estate deal While chasing the culprit with a pistol. All these lines and jokes plot outside the curriculum make me meaningless at all whether the criminal is captured or not. We have already forgotten or are no longer interested in the murder plot at this stage because the multiple plot lines and dessert of the sticks have fooled us beyond understanding. <br /> <br /> While I could continue the chase and how they destroy a decent story, I will not. This may be a very enjoyable film, but it has become too big for its bumps and has become a waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett performed well in fact, and it is worth mentioning that Gladys Knight's appearance is small. Unfortunately, none of the actors can help this hopelessly misleading film of forgetfulness. <br /> <br /> Although this will be better than "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II" which still do not make this a good movie. I once heard that Ford Harrison claimed only the production of films I thought would earn money, I'm not sure whether this is true or not. It's true that getting a wonderful box office does not require a great movie or a great actor, and this film does not play its main roles. My advice to Harrison Ford is: Stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.
