"Look, I know this may be absorbed right now, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever, everything you do now is being burned in celluloid all the time and for thousands of years to come." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> This was initially a film by Steven Spielberg, where the director assigned several screenwriters to adjust the script to fit his subjects. Thus we have a dysfunctional family whose job is threatened by a mischievous monster in the form of a recently released prison from Robert de Niro. Such as "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the dysfunctional family together to defeat the monster, the monster is creating a father, a lawyer failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical Spielberg style, the father kills the monster who undermines the family and then gets rid of his sins immediately. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam, Neil, Tom Cruise, and almost every "Papa" character in Spielberg's territory, the father regains his parental duty in a sweet and bitter drink that Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was handed over to Martin Scorsese, who was trying to experiment with a more commercial fare at the time. It can be said that the result is the worst film in the Scorsese filmography, and ironically that most illumines it. <br /> <br /> The artist's failures or failures are often revealed, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not continue or do not burn the pictures, we find ourselves together in a kind of internal pulp. this is ?? The remaining sacrifice is what the director's cinema is about. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film, so we will not find any objective links to the rest of the Scorsese films ("I've already sacrificed" I! "De Niro screams, but the films from the Catholic redemption are the cookie cut) What the film does, however, is to expose the type of language on which its film is based, witness how the Scorsese camera is hopelessly stuck back and forth, and how it frantically grows on door and window handles in an attempt to impose tension and how all its characters are loud and shouting. From that, watch how the film is meaningless Spatial confrontation on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an acoustic theater There is simply no geographic meaning to anything in the picture, Scorsese is unable to depict space or create any sort of spatial environment. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that the Scorsese camera must always be connected, or closely linked, to its central character.In order for the world to be about the personality logically, its camera must focus on the personality. Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance on one of the streets and the highest building, Cameron can offer you a tour of Titanic, Wim N that Scott re-create a full futuristic view of the city, and can give you a Lucas planet desert strange and can most other directors to create a sense of space through "close to the mid-wide snapshot snapshot" groups in textbooks, but Scorsese could not do so. There is no hair, there is no concrete space in his films. It's all about personal. You break this rope, leave a boxing ring, taxi, look at De Niro, and everything collapses. He simply can not get away from this documentary mode, which is, in some way, a prerequisite for making motion films. <br /> <br /> Scorsese has tried to correct this problem by using "Gangs of New York", where space and personal groupings become central, but even this spatial experience of self-consciousness is sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel DeLay Lewis, the actor who paints a camera Scorsese towards it like a bulb moth. <br /> <br /> 5/10? Even with being a B-year-old film, it's an ugly-looking movie. Take a look at the non-glamorous panels, the ineffective stress attempts, the special rotated flip-flops, and the first hockey match. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the recession. De Niro, who gave his body to Scorsese like the tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great spectacle. In an improvised romantic sequence with a young Juliette Lewis, hangs his thumb in her mouth and kisses her. A sort of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, and gets angry and repulsed by this man's attention. <br /> <br /> De Niro's performance, which was so enjoyable at the top, can not be simply imitated by Scorsese. You will need an opera tone and baroque parables for someone like De Palma to accomplish this work. But Scorsese? Both. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
