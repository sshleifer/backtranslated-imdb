The deceptive cover, title and very small hidden copy of Power of Prayer in the rental of this film fooled me. <br /> <br /> This started very well and attracted me. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of it, the film began to throw things that were not prepared and meaningless. My first thought was, "This was not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up re-watching parts of the film, believing I had missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time you reached the last 1/5 of the movie, everything about BORING, ANNOYING, RELIGION THALPING DIALOG was meaningless, nothing said, it was annoying to listen to; you've turned off sound I quickly went all the way to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this click. <br /> <br /> Beware of the DVDs labeled Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> I am a practicing Catholic.
