As far as I love Japanese films, this film has not only been cut ... The movie is supposed to be about the rebels and the survival of the royal blood line turns out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot. Photography is good, although I have seen far better scenes to fight the sword in other Japanese movies, the quick cameras and the way characters followed did not convince me at all. Voice imaging is very poor, so you have not noticed it. But worst of all is how the plot developed. I must admit that sometimes, I had difficulty understanding who it was and who was being. .. Anyway, Platonic love between the main character and the other person was absolutely unnecessary, and seems to have come from the Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a sexy Japanese movie, that's not it. It's very slow, with very few sword fighting scenes and very emotional ... in a bad way ...
