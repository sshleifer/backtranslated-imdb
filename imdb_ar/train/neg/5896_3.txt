An unanswered call, another Asian horror depends on the cell phone. I recently hired a horror film from Korea based on a mobile phone called "Bon". One missed call was equally boring. The phones may not be scary or anything, but the move was tedious and cumbersome. No tension or excitement for me, the final beast was cheesy disappointing and disappointing. Pull the film a little in different parts, long hair. Did not keep my attention. The phones seem to be intimidating, it's like trying to make a weird pop selling machine. It is ridiculous to compare this to "The Ring", it seems that every Asian horror film is compared to it so far I have not seen any of these measures at least. To the directors of horror - take the phone out of the hook as a device of terror.
