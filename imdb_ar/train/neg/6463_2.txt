I watched Free Money last night and had the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing crew, I really thought I was in a fun place - especially as I liked Brando. Error! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to see it at times (like the cattle scene), and there were lots of missed opportunities for comedic settings (why did not they show Charlie Sheen back to Brando?) Trying to be a comedy, but I did not. Skip this one. Only for fanatical Brando lovers. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think that the worst movie ever was Skidoo.
