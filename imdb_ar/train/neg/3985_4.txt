A common and exciting excitement about a woman colluding and deceiving everyone she loves in order to strengthen her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the role of Tracy the Deceiver, married to Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old friend of the school named Andy Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, the problem does not stand behind him. <br /> <br /> The script fails because it does not develop the promising hypothesis that effective and exciting excitement, and a severe lack of personal motivation, background and development make the presentation complete. None of the actors can raise interest in their shallow personalities, especially Bill Pullman, whom Andy's curiosity is hard to understand. <br /> <br /> The poor director Harold Baker left trying to revive the dead project impossible, unable to make entertainment from any of them. By the time the "secret" of the plot is revealed, you will not be interested in it. <br /> <br /> At least, the cinema in Massachusetts looks good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher, and Joseph Sumer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
