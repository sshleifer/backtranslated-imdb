This film features the look and feel of the student film project. Yes, there are some interesting (though imitated) alterations and footage, but the end result was events. <br /> <br /> The director does not seem to say "Look at this movie." It looked like he was saying, "Look at me, I'm a manager!" <br /> <br /> Excellent.
