spoiler. <br /> <br /> What are the three words that can guarantee a terrible film? Canadian cheap production. The brain fits those words perfectly. A terrible script, stupid representation and ridiculous special effects make this a necessity for all BAD film lovers. Horror is hilarious. The post-production team seems to have surrendered. What makes Brian great in the second half, he actually tries to be good! Could a little ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It is Christmas time. The mother and daughter are killed by one of the most entertaining villains of all time. The next day, a rebellious teenager faces enough trouble to send him for psychological analysis. <br /> <br /> If a policeman's head is cut off and a stranger is told that he has blood and bloody blood, some of the children have done it. What starts funny turns boring and tired towards the end when the brain tries to be serious. The child can not be afraid of frightening moments. THE BRAIN is a very funny concept to try to be brave. Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and his fianc√© get credit for pulling out some of the worst behaviors that I've seen. The viewer is strongly recommended.
