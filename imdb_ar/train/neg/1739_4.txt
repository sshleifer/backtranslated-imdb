Watching that lady in Ermin, I was wondering what Betty Gabel was doing in a project that Marilyn Dietrich seemed to be doing. Someone in the 20th century may have decided that the sex symbol is one like a sex symbol. It was better to know Daryl Zanouk. <br /> <br /> Betty plays the role of the 19th-century Italian Countess, which was invaded by the Hungarian Hossar band captured by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., her ghostly grandfather whose picture hung in the palace hall with the rest of her family tree, A young kid in Doug now and another invader about 300 years ago had dealt with her when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that my current Betty was just married to Cesar Romero, the invasion came at the most inconvenient moments, before things were done. This will give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> New, healthy all my American home is not represented to do seductive and mysterious. Marilyn Dietrich may have finished, but with Betty, he has become more tolerant than the presidential candidate yesterday. She and Fairbanks do not have any chemistry at all, although Doug is as charming as she has always been and someone I can see in anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Rubin wrote the result for this film and The Is The Moment nominated Oscar for the best song. That opportunity fell to Ms. In Ermine to glory Oscar on Buttons and Bows. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died midway through the film and Otto Preminger finished that lady in Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitch had taken into account the foreground here. You can not see that lady in Ermin.
