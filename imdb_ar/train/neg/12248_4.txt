The only real event in the film is the death of the false man and the reaction of the remaining characters. <br /> <br /> In every other way, this film is a very lame rash in Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with little Godzilla (1998) thrown out. <br /> <br /> As is usual for a horror movie like the 1990s, all females who do not attend the tournament wear off at least once. Do not lead the female, where obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The entire film is surrounded by a very stupid extreme sport called "Blood Surfing", where buffooners cut themselves off and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a huge crocodile also takes place with salt water in the area. People eat. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the horror film Bad, but I really hate the horror film Boring Bad, which is definitely this.
