If half the footage of this movie looks strangely familiar, then you see a lot of this wonderful Italian worship! In your opinion, the notorious Desi√®res Folsi did not only produce this film, but also the freedom to reuse the most sadistic series of murders in his movie "Cat in the Brain." The opening scene, in which a whore was brutally cut off by an ax, appears in the subsequent film Volsey, as well as another handful of killings and moments of corruption. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails miserably as Gilo, because searching for the sadistic killer among the cast of a horror film is nothing but compelling and stressful, but still well entertained if you are in a trash can. The unbroken text offers a whole host of hateful characters, all of which are potential crazies, but none of the red spoons that Biachy brings is reasonable and the killer can be referred to almost immediately. All that's left to enjoy is the truly hideous makeup effects and the ghastly performances of the cast. When there is no bloodshed on the screen, such as between the first and second murders, the "carnage" is slow and almost improbable thanks to unfamiliar dialogues and not entirely exciting photography. Fortunately in the second half, there are women who break into the walls and are stabbed repeatedly with rusty heights. The music is nonsense and the use of photography sites is not too imaginative. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go directly to the "Cat in the Brain" listed above. This one features all the wonderful moments of "Massacre", then some.
