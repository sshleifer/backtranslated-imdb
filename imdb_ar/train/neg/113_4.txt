I found the day "they all laughed" on the VHS for sale in a rental. VHS was very old and very used, and I had no information about this film, but I liked the references on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn and John Ritter and Dorothy Sturten attracted me specifically, the price was very low and I decided to take the risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the user rating was 6.0 excellent reference. You searched "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wonderful ?? Four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and see it immediately. In fact, I just finished watching "The All Laughed" and found it a very boring film. The characters were developed badly, and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (special eyes fall in love with the women who haunt her), but I did not laugh throughout the story. Seashells, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Ghazara as an attractive and very attractive man, with the fall of his women as if Brad Pitt or Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is very ridiculous. In the end, certainly the most important attraction is the presence of Playfold Centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by her husband after the release of this film, whose life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story "; The stunning beauty of Patty Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; always wonderful, so that I was fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song" Amigo ", by Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos was the most famous Brazilian singer since the late 1960s and his fans are called "The King". I will keep this film in my collection just because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Straten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laughs and lots of happiness")
