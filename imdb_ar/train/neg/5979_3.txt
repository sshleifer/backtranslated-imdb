Pokemon 3 is a little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, built together without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting, and resolution where everyone is finally happy), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot (over the final credits!) Are filled with no explanation, and everything is very sweet. <br /> <br /> Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my children enjoy Pokemon, and by showing my interest in what they like, we are closer. Still watching a movie in the theater is different from watching it on the tube, and my kids enjoy the full movie experience. I was given the movie 4, mostly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
