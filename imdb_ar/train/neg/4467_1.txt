<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides what category suits the film, but this is not a horror film. For the story, it was fairly interesting, but somewhat slow. I was particularly disappointed by the end. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on earth she ran away to her uncle's house (?) without contacting the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what is going on at this stage, plus she has a video as a guide. Instead, she runs over there and starts eating nuts and says "I know everything, I have a guide! I did not expect proof, did you?" Then she is surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking to her as if he will hurt her. Well DUH! Of course it will hurt you idiot, I told him you know everything and you have evidence to reveal everything. What a stupid end.
