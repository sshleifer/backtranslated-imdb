SH deep .. is more like it! The cartoons are only in the film. I think "Mr. Lambeth Incredible" meets "Leviathan". Very tacky. <br /> <br /> No personal development or relationship. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very vulgar and predictable. It's an interesting idea, but badly written text and LOUSY makes it necessary!
