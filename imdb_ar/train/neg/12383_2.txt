While some of the performances were good - Victoria Royle, Adrian Barbo, and two Italian friends come to mind - the story was lame and derivative, the background was focused on his racist girlfriend in a clumsy way at best, and relatives were often portrayed as stereotypes not real people. I found myself crying uncomfortably in many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can hardly understand why the local newspaper here said at SF that this is a good film, and I wonder who published the glowing review here on IMDb. I was very disappointed in this film, and I'm already crazy I went to a theater to watch it, based on the wrong relationship with Garden State, a more entertaining, creative and touching movie. I must mention in particular the emotional peak in the church, which was largely wooden and the figures from which I left almost, others of the public already did. This was followed by a silly climax in the cemetery, which I saw arriving 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like to be misguided to spend my money to no avail.
