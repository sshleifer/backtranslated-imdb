I firmly believe that the best Oscars in recent years were in 2003 for two reasons: 1) Steve Martin was at his best: "I saw that the two teams are helping Michael Moore in his box" limo "and" It's better not to mention a gay mafia if I wake up with a dog's head in my bed. "Surprising winners: No one Adrian Prodi falls for the best actor (original) Applause) or Roman Polanski for Best Director (booing) But they won. <br /> <br /> Last year's awards ceremony was not so bad, but there were a few surprises and I was happy to see RETURN THE KING NUR The awards were trotted out even if it was not the best in the trio (FELLOWSHIP was much better) but what made the BBC cover down was that Jonathan Ross got a few of his classmates and pretended to be hilarious when he was anything but. So when I heard that Sky was covering up for British television, I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Crowd to do the links, but instead we ended up with Jimmy Thexton and Sharon Osborne! Oh, if British television is desperate for film critics (obviously they are), I'm sure both Bob The Mo and Theo Robertson will happily travel to Los Angeles to give their honest opinions about the winners and losers <br /> <br /> Chris Rock So bad, but it was not Steve Martin while the site looked like a gym with seating in it! Not much of the arena is attractive in my opinion. The main problem I faced at the ceremony was the coordination of the Oscars 'High School Awards' for the winners who were sitting in their seats! There is nothing like a "secondary" Oscar and because the award is for the best moving short film or best fashion design, it deserves the best picture or best director. All winners must be allowed to walk up to the platform. What a bunch of fanatical fanatics turning into an academy, and I fully agree with the comments that this coordination is shameful, and if it is not surprising for surprises, this could be the worst concert in history. For the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Kate Blanchett. Not a big surprise to a competitive class <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman. There are no real complaints because Freeman is one of the greatest representatives of American characters. <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jimmy Fox. Award more than expected of the night. Yawning <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. A big surprise because everyone thought that Annette Penning would simply win the Academy's policies but Swank deserved her and delivered the best speech at night. <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. A big surprise because everyone thought Scorsese would get the prize just because he did not win any of them. In fact, I'm happy because if it's not worth it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, it's not worth it for the pilot <br /> <br /> Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Again, another big surprise because everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought Hollywood's friendly plot of the pilot would have made it a dead certificate for the best picture while the subject of the controversial MDB has turned a lot of voters' vote. What the awards show is that voters decided this year to ignore the Oscar policies and give them real prizes to people who deserve something they did not do in the past, means a beautiful mind of winning a ring for Jude! The academy may vote for a long time with their heads instead of their hearts
