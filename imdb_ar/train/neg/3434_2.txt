I'm a big fan of horror / spit, I even enjoy horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also love Gore. The more joy it has as long as it has a point. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of others on the site, you are sure that this movie will be a small gem. But to my disappointment, it proved to be one of the most useless films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was useless, and the useless special effects were likely to be edited by someone who had died two years earlier. I usually find that all of these properties make a great horror film. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> You have waived â‚¬ 11 for this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really enjoy a useless game (eg "violent" movies) avoid them at all costs!
