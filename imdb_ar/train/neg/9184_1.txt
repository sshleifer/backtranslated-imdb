F * About me! I've seen some incredibly horrifying movies in my time, but this takes pictures! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can not express in words how bad this film is. Along with the plot that did not already exist, the comic staggering representation, horrible appalling excuses for the zombies; you know what, I can go all day long. Everything small in this movie is either stupid, useless, crap or embarrassing. I express anyone who wants to watch this movie ... NO! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say, I have this on the shelf. It's hidden away right down God's curse from a huge pile. I could not even give this excuse to the horse for a distant film. This is how bad it is.
