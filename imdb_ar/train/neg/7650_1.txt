I know I'm in the minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll revolves around a talent like a frog. Not even a frog. Just a frog. It reminds us of about a hundred other untrained infiltrators who are doing a rude, useless festival after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? Is a crap festival. Slater's talent is used only in the minimum, leading to the belief that he has other things (such as his failed relationship) in his mind. Reid plays her role as if she had forgotten her acting lessons, hit hard on her head and became MADE forget her acting lessons, or have one of the worst directors in the film's history. I will vote on the third option, myself, although the other two options are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll did not do one thing and got him even the slightest pleasure. Frankly, I'm relieved that he made this stink. I was interested in the bludry competition with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I am sure that Len Wiseman does not have anything, I mean there is nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> This evaluates a 1.0 / 10 rating for this clown clown clown, from ... <br /> <br /> Punk :.
