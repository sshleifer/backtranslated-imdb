Oh my, I think this might be the most interesting film I have ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best movies b. The first proof is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, this is mainstream for this purpose. I've got this on VHS, from a container full of previously rented videos in my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I may quote this error: "In Japan in the seventeenth century, the samurai lived who put his name Mayeda, was sent on an epic journey around the world to get 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain, While in the sea, a violent storm swallows its precious gold, which aims to buy weapons and almost kills its life. Maida must fight all odds to survive and secure the fate of beloved Japan. " Then goes on to say "epic adventure filled with dollars in a group of three continents" <br /> <br /> I have to see a different film. This was not an epic and certainly nothing was in the millions of dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the adventures of English-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). It's not even a really Shogun, but that's not important. What matters is that he makes a great impression on John Cleese's repeated charge of the only castle in "Monte Python and the Holy Grail" and his ability to move from serious sights to show his mental abilities in the samurai. Wonderful. <br /> <br /> The greatest thing in this film is the tone of Kosugi Sho in Engrish. The film may lack everything that makes a pretty good film, but it compensates for some of the most fun lines ever, presented in the finest Engrish tone ever. Frankly, do you really want anything else? You can fast forward "Shogun Mayeda" to the end, re-read the final line of Kosugi again and again. The ribbon is likely to fade before it gets tired of this line. Wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Very cheesy.
