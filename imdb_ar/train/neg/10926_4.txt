Although the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, implementation is still unusual. Although the practical mummy effects are not bad, and the character of "Gun Nut" outperforms the higher laugh, the only real draw is the vision of Morina Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen. I think that's the idea all the time. They are doing their best for what they have, but "I must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morina was wearing some Tomb Raider shorts. I do not know cinema with a high eyebrow but you can not deny true beauty when you see it !!! Adam Baldwin once again describes him as the man you love to hate. If you just want to watch two of your favorite Firefly characters having fun with some sub-material, it might be right for you. If you want good acting and personality development, we recommend you look elsewhere.
