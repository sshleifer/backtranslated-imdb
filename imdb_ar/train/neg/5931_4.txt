This movie must be only 10 minutes. I mean there is already saturated content of only 10 minutes in this thing (so I hesitate to call it a film). The opening credits for the film were fairly promising. When the film begins with short comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and watch more of the shots about Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of the cave's performance makes you more eager to see more of Cohen, who tickled her smart and verbal words. But as it turns out, the performance of Cave is just the beginning of the super-long tedious performances through a group of people who do not even have the minimum attractions to keep you on your seat. I mean what the director really thinks? Shots for five minutes up close Want to be singers at a fake concert in Australia !!! What the director really believes in insulting the public by adding "fake applause" to these endless bad performances. The perfect torture film shows you very little of what I came to see. There is no single passage from Cohen's past. In fact, except for some photographs of his first days as a singer / poet, there is nothing at all! If you add all the minutes spoken by Cohen, it may not reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are presented a little step by step between the disastrous camera work that captures some of the most attractive people screaming in Cohen's words. If you decide to lose your money in this movie, do not! Just throw it in the trash and save your time at least.
