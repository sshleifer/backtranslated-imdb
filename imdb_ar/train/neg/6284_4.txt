I liked the premise of this film, which prompted me to look for it. But the problem I discovered quickly is that one knows very much what will happen in the first 20 to 30 minutes (the doubles will come from behind the mirror and grab everyone). <br /> <br /> There is no real evolution (which is good), but the final revelation also does not make much sense (how can you be suspicious of the entire film, if it is an evil identifier from behind the mirror? Looking for a more attractive story or scenario, the atmosphere builds up on the atmosphere and the scary sound design top for 80-90 minutes does not really cut, actually becomes very boring.
