I felt that the producers of this mess had come out in order to make the Westerners the most painful and ridiculous at all. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, you have wonderful color photographs and beautiful Ronda Fleming. I sympathize with Jack Obuchon (who played paralysis), who acted well enough in an annoying role, so horribly written that no actor can perform well. The production values ​​were very good, which only helped to highlight the terrible story and scenario. <br /> <br /> Things she hated: Stuart Granger seemed a bit like a Western character, what his British accent was, elegant clothes designed, and a silly clean white napkin always tied around his neck. It was exhausting, as the townsfolk and his son kept yelling at Granger and insulting him, never talking or responding. I know that we are supposed to stop disbelief and appreciate Westerners as practitioners of symbolic ethics, but this image is shattered by unpredictable, unpredictable scenes, and the worst that happens in the end as Granger quickly and dynamically sprawls and individual dynamite around the valley. So pass through the cattle of the bad guys, then granger is planting himself in the perfect place so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create a rocky slab to bury her and terrorize cattle and bad guys, apparently destroying them all, two of the main villains. The worst thing is that everything is about the plot being loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seems reasonable: I could not believe what the whole conflict was about. The bad guy was driving his herd to the market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; I did not see why nothing could be solved. Need a land ownership dispute for it? Do not bother to see it.
