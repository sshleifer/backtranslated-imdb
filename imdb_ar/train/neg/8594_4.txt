At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) Neil (Celian Murphy) told her why she was always looking for an adventure. "Because I carry phobia," she said. This means that they can not really continue their lives by doing some mandatory activities. Well, I think its cause and the way this movie goes is very ironic. Because "watching the detective" is a merry boredom. <br /> <br /> Has any of these characters done something exciting once? Neil is a geek who runs his store for a very small video rental. He and his other obsessed friends hang around the store and watch the movies together during their discussion afterwards. But Neil's life is full when Violet enters his shop. She is an eccentric woman hiding a little secret from him. Anyway, after some dates, they decided to see each other. The problem is that the violet is the person who continues to joke jokes about Neil and can not do anything natural, while Neil totally opposes it. the question is. Will they be in love in the end? You're betting. <br /> <br /> "Watching the detective" is a romantic comedy in essence. They made it worse by pretending to be something else. From the first two months of preparation, we know that Neil is a fairly relaxed man who has not really committed to anything. After that, Violet enters the scene, looking for everything strange and annoying. At this stage, we all know that we will sit down despite all the senseless positions to see how they end up in the end. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the audience. The "detective watch" is trying to talk about commitment. Note how far people go to get something they want. We finally realized that Violet's crazy things were to test how ready Neil was going to win her heart (or anything else). Well, I think it's totally nonsense. The film will end very quickly if Neil says to himself "Forget it, that girl is one of the nutjob!" After collaborating with several great directors recently (Danny Boyle, Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Ken Loach, The Wind That Shakes Barley and Breakfast for Pluto for Jordan, to name a few), it is a very strange choice for To SÃ©lian Murphy making a film with a broken comedy soldier, Paul Sutter. After all, it's not bad (as usual), but such a talented actor should not waste his time in the film like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is as horrible as violet. Her acting is a mess. I mean it is everywhere and more. Tony Montana will be proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not least recent error is that the movie that was created is an irrelevant title. You can not simply connect a point between the plot and its address; then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. In short, "Watching Investigators" is fun, if you're a forgotten animation, you might have a chance to catch them on cable TV so fast you can not imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
