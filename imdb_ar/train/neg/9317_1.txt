I purchased this from Blockbuster for 99p. The man behind the counter said the reason for being too cheap was that the disc was scratched, but he failed to mention why it was so cheap because the film was a very bad effort that was absorbed more than Paris Hilton in the hotel room video. Talk about home videos, how long the game was fair to be released as movies - I mean movies used for hiring actors, technicians, screenwriters, etc. - and nothing more - just bring your friends and ideas together on weekends, enjoy production with a budget of £ 8.00 , And make someone fall on the stairs using a keyboard Casio (soundtrack) - then slap it on the shelves, so that you some poor sap (I) go home lonely despair. The next night, while watching "Hellbreed" by Darren (£ 1.99) to take him home and get away from the blockbuster and different ). Now that the film "Grim Weekend" sounds like an exorcist, Grim Weekend was hit again, catching up with some of the moments on the impressive IMDb boards, which viewers claimed were hilarious. Certainly, once I got the misery, the pain and the horror, Grim Weekend's realization was an amusing voice in toast, and I could enjoy and enjoy it frankly to funny things. A lot of it. Check the boards. Then check out the flick. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
