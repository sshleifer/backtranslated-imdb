Horror / Sci-Fi is interesting because it's laughable. F / X is very good ... for what you can see. Made in a TV movie not as bad as the worst. Jeffrey Combs plays a prominent scientist although he is misled by stem cell research and deals with human DNA using a hammerhead shark. Horrible results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsyth and Hunter Tello have been invited to a remote island to check out the wonderful new experience. Of course, after laughing and stammering in awe ... Compus created, by the way is his son merged with hammer head, loses to look for one of his teammates from his father. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also cast in cast: Elsie Muller, c. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Felizar Benif.
