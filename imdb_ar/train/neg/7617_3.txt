It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but Youth House is definitely much worse. This film is more funny and silly, than scary. I laughed most of the time when I saw him. Low-quality effects (when you see them, you'll understand what I'm talking about, how quality is low), bad actors (I hear them for the first time), and apparently filmed by an amateur camcorder. But at least I had the patience to watch it to the end. Like comedy? See this. Do you want horror? Continue watching Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movies. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about Legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify it as a Horror type. Just some low budget crap. <br /> <br /> I built 3 out of 10
