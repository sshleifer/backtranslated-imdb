Double Bobby "Salsa Pineapple" Veli and Mario Battali drop this. <br /> <br /> Flay being the worst. Certainly one trick, I think they could have had other American chefs to come to the table on this chef named Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes that this duo really brings ... is not reflected in the original Iron Chef series. I do not think Patali went to the chef's school, actually. There are many chefs in America, and I wonder why they do not appear on the food network. <br /> <br /> This may also help to get more regional components and possibly co-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he gives up / very funny for this role.
