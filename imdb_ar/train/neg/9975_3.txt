I remember watching this movie several times as a very young child, and there were parts of it (many of them actually) I did not understand. I think I saw it once as an adult, and then I understood those parts. The only problem with seeing him as an adult was that he was not amused at all. What kind of film is this? Is it a "children's movie"? Not barely. It contains language and subject not suitable for children. Is it an exaggeration in what all his parents feel like passing through their children? Maybe, but then why not focus more on the personality of John Ritter instead of Junior? When the film has a 7-year-old child as the main character, in order to do a good job with its audience, it must be a seven-star film and under the crowd, otherwise older people will not have a means of communication (until 8) Watch a movie about a child a year younger). I'm sure this movie did not achieve good results at the box office, and the reason for that is that it was unable to find a place on the market.
