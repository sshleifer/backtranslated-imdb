I saw it at Artie Cinema also featuring "The Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give the opportunity "Immortel". I almost came out of this movie, I love science fiction! The story takes place in a futuristic New York City, full of Sky Runner-like ads and some similar discussions about cloning human beings. Unfortunately, the scenario was not intensified enough for an hour-and-45-minute film. There are three groups in this world: human beings, synthetic humans, and Egyptian gods. Artificial man seems to have the upper hand and control city policies. Humans are slaves and are used for birth control and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (like the great pyramid of Khufu, complete with the exterior degradation, leaving a smooth "lid" on the pyramid. The pyramid is located above the city and no one on earth understands what it is or why it is there. I will not carry you so-called plot, but there are lots of unnecessary scenes and many overall scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by the fifth element and matrix. At the end of the film, credits were credited to the UK, France and Italy. The film is French but uses British representatives who do not speak French. Thus, it is clear that their French dialogue has been named. This is distraction, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations was very distracting. This does not help in being a bad cartoon - not the best video game. Skip this one.
