This British film is truly shocking, and it is hard to believe that Glen Ford is there, although he sleeps pretty much. The idea of ​​the bomb on the train looks good ... but it turns out that this train ends up in the vast majority of the movie! There is no action, no movement, just a steady train. The area where the train is evacuated is evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone either. In fact, this movie can be used in a film chapter to show how not to produce a suspense film. Real thrill is created by allowing the audience to know things that characters do not know, and this fact is unknown to the director. The spoiler: The train actually has two bombs, but we think there is only one bomb. After defusing the first bomb, it seems as if there is no longer any reason to watch the film anymore. But at the last moment, the villain, who has no clear motive for his actions, reveals the existence of two. Nor are we sure when the bombs explode, so we do not have a classic tense sequence of time bombs. She spends 10 minutes or more watching the French wife of Glen Ford thinking about leaving, and then wondering where he is. It's an annoying figure that we do not care about whether they reconcile with it, so when you do, there's nothing emotional about it. Most other characters are somewhat devoid of character, and there are no problems or problems. It takes only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it is dull and boring. do not waste your time.
