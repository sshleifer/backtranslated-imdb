Although I can not deny that his films are often amusing, I always felt personally that Martin Scorsese was a bit overpriced in his abilities. It seems that his use of brilliant styles in a good number of his films screams "Look at me, do not I be a fantastic way out?". The best film I have ever seen is the film with the lowest boom, the movie "Raging Bull." <br /> <br /> On this new version, it seems to be working as usual. The staggering stock of films that was in the 1950s was so nice that it was a distraction. It is likely that close-up dramas alongside the substandard tradition of "psychological" classics will be more ironic than cynicism in the atmosphere. The result of "Psycho" was brilliantly alarming, and this "greeting" just seemed noisy and annoying. Even the cast of actors, who can sometimes be decent, make historic "caricature" presentations; the notable exception to this role is the clever role played by Lewis as an impressive teenage daughter of the Bodine family. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly the worst criminal acting here is De Niro. Certainly, it seems appropriately threatened, but once it opens its mouth that drains the aura. Now I'm not an American dialect expert. I came from Manchester near England in everything, but surely he could have made a more convincing southern tour than that? Being a talented physical actor is, he overcomes this almost fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disturbing to me, as a De Niro fan, to wish he had been out of the screen, instead of escaping his performance. <br /> <br /> (Potential spoilers.) <br /> <br /> The entire film's high style extends to an overly ironic end. When will Scorsese learn that underestimating the situation can sometimes lead to tension as much as to give the viewer a loud and audible blast? I also thought he was well-respected for his reputation for the cheap, "non-lethal" trick used by less talented people. <br /> <br /> In general, "a completely ridiculous film". Scorsese and De Niro did a much better job together.
