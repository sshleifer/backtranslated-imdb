The fire of St. Elmo has no effect on life after university at all (for the majority of us people anyway). Why did you make this garbage? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors who have had to deal with such a terrible scenario. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who did a good job elsewhere. You should just have one complete joke for them in a group. <br /> <br /> I found this "film" actually offensive to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this was the hope that Mr. John Hughes had laughed hard when he saw a show this year in the same year that the "Breakfast Club" masterpiece was shown. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake that you did in watching this because you enjoy 80's movies. This is really an attack on this genre.
