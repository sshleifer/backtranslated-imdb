Lots of death happens in the wild. You do not need to be a scientist in rocket to see it! But should it be the focus of a documentary about nature? What is this magic with the heinous death? Should we see an adult villa torn into bodies by a group of hungry lions? Or, the leopard clutching a deer in a slow motion, no less! I thought this would be a family-friendly film! <br /> <br /> Why do not you have the courage to show outrageous violence in film trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> Then in a typical comic style, we can see the magnificent birds of paradise that perform the mating rituals into the most disturbing and stupidly humanly possible narrative. It was surreal! It seems as if the directors think they were only addressing a group of first and second graders on a field trip to school! Wonderful! From the middle to the inherited in the heart beats! <br /> <br /> If there are any future documentary filmmakers in nature waiting in the wings to read this film review, why not focus on: animals actually accumulate; breed; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping. Clean each other. Socialization. (Yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; in other words, stop focusing on violence or violence; Lower the level of beauty, why not be more almost - and focus on cheer and inspiration instead?
