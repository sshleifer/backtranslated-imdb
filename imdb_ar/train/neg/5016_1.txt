Nick Stahl, the young actors and the attractive cover of VHS made me buy and watch this, and I expect to see a good teen movie. This is nonsense! Filled with scenarios of clich√©s, dialogues and performances are awful, horrible, too bad, awful, horrible? Summarize, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just a very boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, but three pairs, like a group of friends, but in fact very bad people who seem to be enemies. They play a silly, meaningless game called "taboo", each writing yes or no to some taboo. That is: there is no previous evolution of characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and their relationship. After that, there is a deleted tag a year later, the same group meets together at a New Year's Eve party, insulting each other in a very harsh way. But the plot and twist is very silly, predictable, modest, unbelievable and deserves no extra line in my assessment. Just one tip: do not waste your time or your owner on this trash, you'll definitely regret it. One voice (awful). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo ?? Playing With the Killer")
