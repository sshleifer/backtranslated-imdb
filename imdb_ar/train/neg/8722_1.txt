The film "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" ends with a dramatic trio by Sergio Martino near the end of the 1970s (including "L" L "Isola degli uomini pesce" and not a good "La Montagna del dio cannibale".) The obscene tracking plot of the "jaw", the script fails to create any suspense what ever the creature is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani poorly portrayed the adventures of these silly tourists who have been introduced from the beginning as clear elements to the reptile meal.No thrill out of this, but teachers in fact! This pathetic excuse can be found to be very funny if the dialogues and the appearance of the indigenous people are not clearly inspired by pure racism, and very soon laughter is stopped in favor of the sour feeling of such a patronizing attitude. Kind of mental.
