This is almost like two films - one known to read, write and participate, the other stupid and cliched. It's really a shame that all the problems have not been successful in writing, but given how fast B movies are produced and produced, this is not unusual. It's a real shame, although it could have been a very good film. <br /> <br /> First the good. The film is original and includes World War II code breakers. This is very cool and I loved watching the leading man (Lee Bowman) walking fast as the main law. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now for the worse, the film continued for a long time and lost its power in about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers should be "laughable friend" as one of the worst linear and scattered roles in the history of the film !! For every clever move by Bowman, the idiot Rogers intervened to fix things as a kind of misleading "misleading comedy". If its role was cleverly written, the gross movie would have improved dramatically! Instead, by watching it, it's hard to understand how we won World War II !!
