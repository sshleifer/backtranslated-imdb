I'm sorry but I did not like this document very much. I think a million ways could be better. It is clear that the people who have done so do not have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting and offer no real vision. The footage was not collected in a very useful way, either. It is very bad because this film really deserves special special features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rossellini becomes more beautiful as she grows up. All look, this only gets a "4."
