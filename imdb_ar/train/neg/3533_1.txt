Let this film be the death knell of the "big" films that emerged in the 1990s. Known in some circles as Kaiser-Suez Syndrome, this light-to-death film was now discarded by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna") uses the Soze model in a much more restrictive way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham stars (with a highly dubious head of hair) stars like Jack Green (known to all as Mr. Green.) He may or may not be the mastermind of Mr. Gold. Or, perhaps Mr. Gold is a sour soul that members of the underworld can possess. I'm not quite sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most extreme examples of film overtaking, I've been resentful of endurance in a long time. Watch the broken time structure, the painful jumps, the continuous internal monologues, and the painful, buzzing sequence. The "Everything and Kitchen Basin" style makes the appearance of Quentin Tarantino a graceful look. Smoke and movie mirrors only lead me to believe that Richie was bored when I told her a vulgar story as I watched her. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments of revelation supposed to be shocking, but only Mr. Green's news comes. I wanted to love Green because I always enjoy Graham as a person who takes two steps for everyone. Here, though he struggles as a therapeutic reader in the separation of English university literature. His lack of intelligence is matched only by the lack of restraint shown by his enemy Macha (Ray Leuta). He walks to Utah on a scene like a starving man in Smorgasbord, spits and Utah and screams through the film in an embarrassing display of speedos printing cheetah and over-printing. <br /> <br /> There are no substitution attributes for REVOLVER. It's another Ritchie industrial faux movie and may outperform the miserable rerun of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film yet.
