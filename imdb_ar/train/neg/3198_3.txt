In short, the film had little to do with the weak first acting with some forced representation, rhythm and detachment to a certain extent, to some extent the second decent act that succeeded in building some tension and intrigue despite some uneven rhythm and some poor performances by the crew, Third ... there was almost no work! <br /> <br /> With respect to the third film, the film ends abruptly. There is no accuracy and no path down from the peak of the second verb, so there was not much third verb. The bad guys are dying that is; end credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the hero, supporting characters, and so on. The audience is likely to leave the theater after the film, wondering "That's it?" The song is a real disappointment. <br /> <br /> He composed the music David Bell, who worked well enough to serve the film most of the time, but it certainly is not great. It is only a process, but it does so by being generic and derivative. It is also clear that the result is very dated with the use of composite buildings for some rhythms. I was least impressed by the fact that some moments of tension bode well for music signals that seem to have been separated from the 48-hour James Horner. And "commandos", especially copper. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the film was likely because the same basic story was good, but the implementation was weak with the medium direction, poor acting, and somewhat inconsistent rhythm. <br /> <br /> There was no third action to finish the story correctly, and this omission is great and unforgivable because the film is not allowed to end satisfactorily. This may be either a scenario or maybe it was on production cut photography or editing the third act in the final film due to budgetary constraints (but I expect the reason for the lack of a third procedure). Whatever the reason, the sudden end hurts the film in general. <br /> <br /> This is a good thing to show if you're curious and you can get the movie at a very cheap price and know why you need to have 3 works (beginning, middle, end) if you write scenarios and produce movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste time if you can not get the MST3K version to get at least some laugh out of it.
