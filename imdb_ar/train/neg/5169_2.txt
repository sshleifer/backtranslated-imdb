Warning: I recommend that anyone who has not seen the movie so far not read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen them all, the Hamilton team has certainly made a simple piece of entertainment, which is not seen at all entertaining !!!! I thought this film was in common with the plot of the semi-bad plot, the stupid scheme, and the development at the end of the film, which was too lagging, sucking these films !!! They are people who eat other people. Yes ...... I noticed that people are not human beings, not because they are not human beings, or wait I think they, or do not wait, did not tell you !!!! Well, are these people cannibals, or are they suspicious, or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe they just "things" came here to see what people looked like or were they cannibals who ate? People for a long time now, or maybe this movie HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! that was !!! If you think the Hamilton is good, I ask you why, why, why, why, why it was so wonderful, because for me it was just an awful apartment! ONE BIG BOOOOOOO FOR THE HAMILTONS !!! Go See The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of entertainment !!!!!
