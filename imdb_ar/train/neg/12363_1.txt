This is one of those movies that were apparently trying to ride crazy martial arts. Kind of like Billy Jack think. However, while Billy Jack had a prominent art scene in martial arts, there is nothing in this scene unless you think of some wrestling and madness as such. We knew the star who was described as judo in the marines. I was in the Marines and while I was in boxing, I do not remember any confirmation of judo. As a result, James McCarthy's opponent points to judo when he offers an excuse for why the state wrestler is so easily beaten. Lame.
