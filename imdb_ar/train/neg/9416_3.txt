Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans out there. He was certainly a charismatic fellow, one of the most attractive characters the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can not keep this turkey of the film, filmed as a Brownie camera at the actual locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen's new baby with no criminal record has been brought to the layout of the bank robbery by one of the other gang. There is more than just a broad hint that there is a continuing gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He does not like at all by members stealing others, mainly because of his lack of criminal appeal. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy who suspects something happens, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton, James Dukas and Clarke, all of whom are pretty characters. This will certainly raise my doubts. <br /> <br /> The theft of St. Louis the Great had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Steeks. Guggenheim mostly made documentary films and Stokes did nothing. One of these clowns decided that Steve's performance was better than performing the bad Marlon Brando tradition. <br /> <br /> This movie may be downgraded as Steve McQueen's worst. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed on Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they'll get it if they see it. <br /> <br /> Or they saw something the audience had ignored except for dressing up for this turkey.
