Somehow, a woman working with a world of round metal balls puts in the mouths of people who are supposed to change her personality but in fact turn her into zombie-like killers. The "guinea pigs" of the experiment are young women in thin clothes and badly in need of acting classes. This film is terrible, terrible and surprisingly bad. It has no logic in the script. You will really have a problem in following what is going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen, which is supposed to represent a huge scientific advance, does not look more than the old Atari screen. Worse still, there is also a puppet with hairy threads (looks like a lonely child in the summer camp) named George, like Jessica's personal maid ("the leading actress.") Throughout the film, she will be exposed to the mysterious and nice words of this doll. But wait ... You'll also get lots of nice, non-dramatic, barely naked scenes with girls with some players. However, disturbing background music is played in the background like a kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors are good. There are varying degrees of bad. The aspects of injustice and "horror" are portrayed inefficiently. The film really looks like a teenager put it together. It is no coincidence that Henri Sala, the director by name but not by trade, did not make another film. I was almost bored in a coma I see stupid, stupid and angry! How does the end fit? what happened? If you know, let me enter in the secret because I can not know that for my life. All I know is that I lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of the weekend a real nightmare!
