I am a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I will go to any movie to see it which took me to Purple Butterfly. As far as I wanted to like this movie, I must agree with many others who commented on it. It's very confusing and also very slow. Since the entire film seems to have been shot with a handheld camera, important parts of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and little to tell you. There are countless scenes for people standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other without a conversation. The way the film's time turns is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even after reading a number of reviews in advance and having a general idea about the subject of the film, I still had a hard time understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the film was not remotely similar to the previous Ziyi Zhang films but was looking forward to seeing it in something different but unfortunately I was disappointed in the end. She has never smiled in this film although it is recognized most of the time that she does not have anything to smile at. I could do without sex scenes because they were sexless and without any obvious feeling among the participants as you can find.
