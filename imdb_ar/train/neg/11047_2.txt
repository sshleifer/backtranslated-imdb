There are two reasons why I did not give 1 to this film. One reason is that some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) are working, who have tried to play a generally good level of acting. But in many scenes it was blocked in one way or another because of bad scripting. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the brilliant idea and feel of Cyborg, which is quite different from most of the other roles I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as possible. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialog boxes, and bad script work. It seems to have been the first film for many actors. It could have been an interesting story, but it completely failed.
