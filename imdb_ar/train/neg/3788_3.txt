There's a lot to admire here. First-class actors, the script provides a good dialogue to capture the atmosphere of a loved and tightly knit family. However, for this reason the film does not ring true. Leo, who seems to have just learned about the diagnosis of HIV infection, is reacting fundamentally in a way that does not fit into the supportive environment for which he finds himself. Also, the film ends somewhat abruptly to avoid what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must deal with in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays the role of Leo's brother, Marcel, is as impressive as the rest of the actors. Unfortunately, scriptwriters could not determine whether they wanted an insight into the effects of HIV on an attractive functional family or what the effects of HIV on the victim were - so he only hinted at both. While this film provides food for reflection, it leaves the viewer wanting much more than he offers.
