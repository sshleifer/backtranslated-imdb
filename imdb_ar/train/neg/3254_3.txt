Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this movie fun to watch and of course, this gentle little gallet burned the screen with her artistic abilities and exciting hot body. China O'Brien is annoyed by the police officer and decides to call her left and return to her hometown and return to her roots and father, a local mayor. Her father grew up and the city changed. The gangsters took over the city and began pushing local women to start the tricks. The city's inhabitants were sick and tired of their city going to hell. Well, you can almost guess what's going on, and you're right, China O'Brien is fighting again after a great tragedy hits her life. Mismanagement over the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful end.
