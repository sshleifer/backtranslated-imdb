This film is not just a very bad film, with terrible actors - or supposed actors - a boring trend and an unattractive story, but also a wonderful scene from the excellent film "Giallio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago) Famous Italian film and cult film around the world. In the film "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director returns the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with a peeping look from the bedroom window. Of course, the scene in the film Rizo is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of the film Martino. Putting another black girl, another white girl, and another looking at the scene, is simply the best way to prove that Rizzo has no ideas, no authenticity, no taste, nothing at all. I think such things are a crime for the spectator.
