Good performance and artistic direction do not make good films. This film is very depressing and depressing, and I felt no joy at all in the happy ending of the trade union strike. The humor attempts involving Leake's pregnancy are disastrous at all, and any film in which Baldwin's brother already has a blow against him. On the positive side, Lang is still one of the great American actors, he alone makes it worth celebrating in a VCR. I give this 4.
