After finishing the book the same day I saw the film, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations for the film because of the ratings. The only reason to give this movie two stars out of 10 stars is that it was fine trying to have a movie. I have two main points to dislike this film. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. Casting. Jack Nicholson hardly fits the character of Jack Torrance. Also, you have never chosen Shelley Duval for Wendy. Wendy was photographed much differently. I can see why they chose Jack Nicholson, though, smile, tapered eyebrows, but he is not supposed to really look "evil". It is supposed to look natural, and turn into evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was fine and he needed more life though. He behaved in a manner of Ladrony. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut a lot of things that were in the book, and they added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking at in the movie were either deleted, altered, or incorrectly processed. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (hedgehogs, rock hammer, elevator) were not in the movie, and were two and a half hours !! I felt very angry. <br /> <br /> 3. End. The finish was completely changed, Haloran died, Jack froze to death, and Wendy was never hurt ... The Overlook movie was not blown. The end was very cold in the book, and the film was horribly spoiled, I was disturbed. Haloran was not supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they want to kill him, at least use Jack to hammer a Rocky. She never saw a Rocky hammer during the entire film. <br /> <br /> There are other things I did not like in the movie, but there were things that were fine. The camera angels were wonderful, and the blood outside of the elevator (did not happen in the book) was wonderful, but maybe I felt very angry because the film did not go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I recommend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for agreeing to the signing of a contract for Dis Stanley Stanley Kubrick. I never did, I would get all the rights I could shout at all day long. I can not wait to see the version which takes 6 hours, at least contains hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
