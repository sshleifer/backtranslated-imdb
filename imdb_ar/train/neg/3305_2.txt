He never failed to see what was funny in this film. The humor seems to be reserved for the bodies. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not raise much sympathy, aside some important figures aside. Nothing happens surprise. What did the book think of this text? "Oooo funny! Let's make some old lady so high in the pot ... let's make them laugh ... let's make them ... act like little children !! Oooo, yes, this is fantastic and very innovative!" <br /> <This film has generated great anger from all the films I've seen in the last five years.
