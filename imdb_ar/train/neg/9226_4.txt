Well, maybe the film festival loved her. But the return of your average popcorn movie, which has raised up to $ 10 or $ 15 to watch a movie these days, is likely to ask why it made that choice. If the "coppola" is stamped they are wonderful things automatically, right? Error! It's a neat parody of Filmmum's claims. But it is terrible "in". I am concerned when filmmakers are more interested in entertaining themselves than the audience. It is interesting as a cinematic masterpiece with a muffled laugh or two. But once it is turned on in movies and television, dust will thicken on film boxes and tape cases. Hardly either epic or epic!
