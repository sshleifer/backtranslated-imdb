I have not seen one of these original versions of SciFi before, and this was the first. I think it is just fair to judge the representation, direction / production, set design and even CGI effects on other SciFi movies. To compare it to your model Hollywood production is unfair. However, I will say that the total Rex Aztec did not quite remind us of the masterpiece of Werner Herzog Herzog, the wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I will start by pointing out that, yes, I understand the fact that this film has more to do with cultural clash than with dinosaurs. Although it is a scientific film dedicated to television, there is some basic context for the story I will discuss. The listed symbol elements are clear enough. <br /> <br /> Thus, as a student of history, theology, mythology and cinema: I found the dialogue to be outrageous and the themes of the plot somewhat insulting. I do not ask any culpas mea on behalf of producers - as I said before the film is what it is. But what worries me is that most of the younger demographics of this film may rely on television for their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is clearly manifested in personality. Ayacoatl (not a comment on Dichen Lachman's performance, but simply how I wrote her character, although I will say she has some work to do before she receives any verbal gestures). Through her character, the actions of European Europeans are justified. Her role in the film as a love of Rios confirms that the European way is the right way, because they are simply Europeans. There really is no other specific reason. It is really a mere assumption that the viewer aims to connect the Europeans with Aztecs because their clothes, language, ideology etc. are more familiar to them than Aztec - so the Aztec is portrayed as hostile and "backward." It is not simply that the scenes are left with this assumption because of the perception But it really seems that the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the Aztec were not able to come up with a plan - if not better - to attract dinosaurs until her death on the Punjabi bed. <br /> <br /> In fairness, there is A subset of Spaniards who portray themselves as looted temples and intend to simply exploit "At the end, the Aztec warrior is still portrayed as the main opponent of the film, even on the" Radical Lizards " (More about that later) He portrayed him as a traitor and a double and tried to send the European romantic spaniel through his deceit in eating the fungus that changed the mushrooms - an important spiritual element of certain aspects and religions of Central American and indigenous peoples (again, more about this later ) That he can keep the female that he feels belongs to him and away from her Spaniards. <br /> <br /> Now, in analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving explicit Christian themes and obvious paganism on the table) from a symbolic point of view - the viewer can easily take the so-called thunderworms to be representatives of Central American ideology / theology, Filmed in this film as a single goal: the thirst for blood, cruelty, cruelty, bad guys, and perhaps even evil? In the opposition, we have this group of wander Christians, led by a young Hernando Cortis portrayed as na√Øve, but noble overall, carrying lambs in the dark pagan world of the Aztec. Also, the film's name is Aztec Rex, prompting one to believe that it is dinosaurs to eat people. Aztec Rex, however, is Aztec King, the head of the Aztec state, or in this case the "state of existence." (Thus, why the movie title was changed). Who in fact sees the new Aztec king in the end? It's the Spanish Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to the new European ideology which, through disease, bloodshed, war and famine, overcame the Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the ideal European - the filmmakers want to be remembered (as opposed to Curtis, who represents "practical European - so far - noble"). But when you study the Holocaust in the Americas, let us be honest: do not the symbolic components of the story of this film lag behind? <br /> <br /> I must say that Aztec Rex is at worst a bit racist, or that he is nice, ignorant at best. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's just a movie, I understood that everything was fun, but in the end, we left the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what the Native American people should think about at this end ... As for me, I thought he was a bit lenient. <br /> <br /> The best supporting performance of the film goes to Ian Zirring wig - though clear - it has at least changed the appearance of Zirring enough so I did not think I was watching the Yobi from 90210 driving a group of invaders In the heart of darkness. Ziering actually proves that he is more representative of the ability in this film, I have already purchased his performance, or at least forgot that he was Ian Ziering anyway. I do not know who his agent is, but he must get more work. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I was also pleased to see Jim McGee again. I've been a fan since his very short performance to steal the scene in the film Scrooged 1988. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
