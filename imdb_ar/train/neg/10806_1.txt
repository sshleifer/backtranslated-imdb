If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think there's something funny, you'll enjoy the doubt. The first to put professional players in the films barely works. Shack was one of the worst actors I saw alongside Dennis Rodman, who made some bad films. Well, this movie is also bad due to the heinous child. I would give this zero but this is impossible.
