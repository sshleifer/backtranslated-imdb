Hard Movie Rating. I did not give it a concentration of 110% and therefore I was simpler than the plot, I could not say with certainty exactly who was doing between the FBI figures and what their roles were. I can not take Irwin seriously as film characters when their lines and scenes are all in the style of one of his programs, and they are not represented. <br /> <br /> This is just a glittering episode of the Discovery TV TV show, with a sub-plot that does not matter much to the going, which seems to be blocking the way. Although any show for Irwin is always worth watching, this movie is worth watching too, but not on Christmas Day. If I'm talking about it, I'd rather do a lot of things here. High 4/10
