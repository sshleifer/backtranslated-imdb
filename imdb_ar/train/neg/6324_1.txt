I spent eight years running movie theaters in the 1980s and 1990s. This was by far the worst film I've ever seen. The only thing that made it so bad was that it was put on air in an attempt to be a wonderful and inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Beck could not save this horrible piece of driving from being below average. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her early role in a horror film, has clearly demonstrated that she has not yet learned to act (still trying, but not getting much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because it scared the kids of playing a small baseball game in the league! Even the shows on Nick and Disney are not stupid enough to try to convince us to give up on you. <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time you will miss watching on cable TV. Not worth the price of renting a movie; it would be better to spend your dollar on an extra pack of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it could be better than this only).
