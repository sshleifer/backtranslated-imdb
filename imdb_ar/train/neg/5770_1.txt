If you want to create a film thermometer, this movie will be zero at all. Of the ten stars, I would like to make it as follows: <br /> <br /> Widget: 0 stars Video quality: 0 stars Sound quality: 0 stars Starring: 0 stars <br /> <br /> It looks like High school students met one afternoon with the camera, made a conspiracy and filmed a movie. It lacks any artistic value so much so that I prefer to watch the children wandering around high school instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is something that can be said in deep depths. An "exchange of fire" in the stairs is one of the most devastating scenes ever destroyed. First of all, the fighters simply throw plastic weapons at each other, wearing their arms back and forth to simulate the bounce. In fact the pair "duck" bullets are not present to each other. No irony, no sparks, no blanks, just waving steam guns. If you want to see two grown men playing "representative," rotate it one day ... After you clean the fridge, comb the carpet, polish all the door handles, break the gravel, straighten the books on the shelf, etc.
