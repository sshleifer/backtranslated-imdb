A fragmented film about a couple of people in Austria during a heat wave. This type of film has been often, and most of all, better. Stories have nothing to do with each other, apart from the pathetic end: "People are cruel." Ugly body, bad people and a film that goes on for a long time without really raising a point ... very realistic? Barely ... boring? In fact. Not even the wonderful Francesca Weiss can save this! 10/03
