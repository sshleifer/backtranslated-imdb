Let me start by saying that this does not sound like a movie. It looks like just another TV show about famous girls and boys who do not have a real movie language to re-introduce. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are very clear forward so that the story is told in the simplest way possible that the audience never communicates with it. This film takes us to where no film I have ever seen before: to a world where film theater becomes a warm medium that gives the audience every element of interpretation. very clear. Do not use the large cinema screen except as an expanded TV, where we can see each feature of these women more than life. <br /> <br /> Recently, young directors seem to be introducing the art of filmmaking to sales. This is very scary. Industry corrupts art in films. We must educate ourselves and our children about the reality of cinema and its language. Not only sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate with emotions, emotions and even culture. Not as a launching pad for singers and young women.
