There was a possibility. I saw crawling and thought, "Oh, this is interesting" several times. However, interesting lines of intrigue have been made clear or not ignored in some way, as they have not. The leading figure was annoying throughout the film, and one time I and I both screamed that we wanted her to die. There are some really nervous / scary moments, but these moments have overwhelmed me with hell. It's another horror film that interests you and interests you for a while, but it eventually makes you feel a little bit frustrated and confused about what filmmakers were trying to achieve. The film is the bad person, but when the boy is more likable than the leading character, you know that you are a loser.
