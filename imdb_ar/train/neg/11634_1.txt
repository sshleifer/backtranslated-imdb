I watched this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival, in the presence of Dr. Oy Paul the Great. <br /> <br /> The movie, simply, is very bad. And no, not the usual way for Uwe Boll "very bad, it's actually amusing", but just bad. The plot relates to a man who lives an awful life (apparently because of a past criminal record) and can not get a job, with an awful wife of Â£ 900. The man turns to his uncle, the commander, in a plan to steal a truckload of games containing the avian influenza virus. Al Qaeda also has designs to steal games, and the following is just under two hours of sex and violence is completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The representation is terrible (except for Dave Foley, who really tries, though), jokes never rise above shooting children in slow motion, people take stools. It's supposed to be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think of "Airplane!" , But was done by the creators in South Park and without any jokes.
