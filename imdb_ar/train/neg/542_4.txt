First of all, there is the Gujarati Theater and then there is Bollywood. Both have their strength and the following fan. Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati theater when Bollywood is produced. Initially, Aachen (adapted from the Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot but could not bear an Indian film - was made. He has now adapted another Gujarati play called Waqt - a race against time. In short, the emotions are strange. The development of the plot is not for Indian films. For example, it is better to leave role-playing between the father and son at the Gujarati Theater - do not attend an Indian film. It is best to leave the comedy track to the Gujarati stage. All offers are mediocre - nothing screaming - except Chevali Shahaya Shah which is wonderful.
