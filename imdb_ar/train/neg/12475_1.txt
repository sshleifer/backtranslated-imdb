I do not remember going out of the theater only once. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An interesting plot, characters made of clay, useless violence. I did not care when the good guys died. I did not care when the bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic were put in the form of a powder for the liver and there was no cohesion. In short, great entertainment if you spend too much time in hell.
