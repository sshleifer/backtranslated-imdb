First let me say that this should be at the top of the boring film list. Nothing, I mean nothing in this exciting film even remotely. Most of them are very confusing and with your progress you just wish it would end! Some people want a film that makes them "think" about everything, which I say ... "More power for you" !! On the other hand I just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinking, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and time consuming. It seems that most here also agree. Most of this has no meaning, and by the time you think you have one scene discovered another lame scene .... well, I think you see where this happens. Avoid, this one sucks .... Bad!
