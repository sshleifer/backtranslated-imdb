This program really exaggerated. The interrogator, like Danny Pino's hot-headed figure, had been transferred to the Rubber Rifle Squad for years. The entire group is composed of dignified, dignified figures who try people whose deeds have been back for decades according to the 2007 standards. Each Vietnam veteran has never been the killer, unless he is a veteran of Vietnam. There was only one black murderer, and his white boss put it on him. The only Spanish-born killer was a "traitor race" who killed another Latino man to frame a Hispanic street boy for a crime he (naturally) committed two rich white children. What a bunch of publicity. Hey, screenwriter: Minorities and the poor are also committing murder. In this show only, most of the killers are white from the upper layer. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the arrest of people in the 1970s, 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 50 to 60 years ago is a joke. A real-life person will not pay homicide because it means that the state will stumble with their enormous medical bills until they finally kick in. The state will do their families and insurance companies in favor. The prosecutor will charge them with manslaughter and will never serve. The only old criminals who go to jail are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, who reinforce their high-level convictions of da functions.
