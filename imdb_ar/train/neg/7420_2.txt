A love story without feeling, drama issues in vain (or drama) .... It is supposed to be all this film and failed in every account, as if it is not trying. Or as if the director / editor / script team is not really trying. Representatives are capable - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One of the things that does not fail is George Delaro's score. Beautiful and moving. What a shame she attached to this film. In the good words of actors, movements and music coincide and enhance the effect. This editor was edited on music without regard to dialogue and motion. The sight of love is particularly grateful in this regard: an insult to the talents of the principal actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that works: photographing the site. Especially one moment at the Grand Central Station. I guessed in advance what would have happened; but the way they were filmed in this place was impressive. <br /> <br /> Some commentators at this forum have pointed out that the United States' assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists has already occurred during these years of MacCarthy's horror. The moment the film seems to have begun to look seriously at American society, it turns into traditional romance; before any human emotion can move us away from a "predictable" escape. <br /> <br /> Just as the film defiles the talents of actors, it deplores the issues it claims (and fails) to address. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
