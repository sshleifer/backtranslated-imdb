Parasomnia has interesting headquarters, but the story did not go well without any tension or even a logical approach. Uncensored actors, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played wonderful roles in films such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the crew is unknown (not very well) except Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the Big Animation Animation Trilogy). But he can play such roles in his sleep (which he does here a little). The main problem is that the actions of the characters are meaningless at all. The story is somewhat tedious and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some wonderful scenes, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This could have been a lot better, and I do not get good reviews on this. It's really below average.
