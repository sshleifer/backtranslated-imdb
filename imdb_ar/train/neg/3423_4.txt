This is the perfect sex in the seventies of the last century in the genus Ross Meyer, although it is probably less surprising than some of Meyer's works. This movie has higher Production Values ​​than many of its contemporaries, indicating a larger budget. It's a conspiracy to write and act directly outside the B area, though. More recently, it has become the mainstay of B movie channels (like "Drive In Classics") in the 500-channel universe. If the core pulp is what you are in the mood, then it is "good" like anything else in group B. Do not expect Polanski though, Sarno is only Sarno. No more, no less. Perhaps Jennifer Willis as the "mother" was the best actor. None of the actors in the film took part in greater fame, and no surprise. Confessions of a young American housewife are not far from the worst example. It's viewable, if that's your movie type. Thirty years ago, this was a wonderful and risky film. You can see the same kind of things on Showtime / HBO these days and at peak times.
