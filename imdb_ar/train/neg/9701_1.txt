The sequel is really bad. The first part went through a lot of ridiculous moments - Part 2 was very bad (in a boring way) and obviously it was done to take out fan money. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The joyful moment in the film is Helge Schneider, who seems to be nervous about other characters. Very easy to identify with ... <br /> <br /> Screenplay is dirty / does not exist. The manager must work for everyone and leave his job immediately. Representation is worse than a school play in the second row. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very bad, but who can blame the photographer / vocalists who have been forced to work with such an incompetent director?
