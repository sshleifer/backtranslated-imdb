The title above is used to show "Gen" on his audience. The general revolves around a young doctor (Doga Rutkai) with a sick mother. The film begins by leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While driving, we realize that it is not close to home because the hospital is located in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital garden, she sees the body of one of the patients. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in hospital because all the roads are cut because of bad weather. All their contacts with the outside world are also broken. There is no way out !! In those few days, there will be more bad murders. Now everyone is suspected of each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is great. It could have been quite scary indeed. There are positive aspects of the film of course. I really liked the beginning of the film. Especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in hospital. The verbs are fine. Some of them are trying hard to be vague and frightening. I think the last shock should have spread out of the film. What I'm saying is, it was a good development, but instead of being a parody at the end, we should have realized that it would happen when we saw what was happening. The director needed to explain it completely and I think he did not work well. He is also supposed to be the most serious patient in the movie at least 48 years old, but his body looks very young and fit for a person spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say some things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently discovered that he was only 21 years old. This made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I will not rate this film out of *****.
