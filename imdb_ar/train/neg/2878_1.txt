Do not see this movie. Bad behavior and stupidity stupid effects. waste of time. I was hoping to see lots of cold killings and hot chickens, and instead the director relied on the animal slaughter videos to shock you, O Watcher. Disgusting. Murder is very lame, mainly choking. One woman fills the worms in her mouth, one puts the raw hamburgers on her face and stifles them. BTK = BTK beef, the new "killer" sandwich for Burger King .... ha ha. I do not think this film relied heavily on the actual facts. I mean, it's a true BTK killer that did not carry a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and yes ... a cow's head was also slaughtered. Go and conclude.
