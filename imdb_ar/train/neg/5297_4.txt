It really amazes me when someone encounters a movie like this and claims to be one of the worst movies there. This is not by far the worst, still not a good film, but it is not the worst though. Go to see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake, then go back and tell me if you think Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has a good work on the camera and its adjustment, which is much more than I can say for many obscene films. <br /> <br /> The film does not show deaths on the screen. There is one death that sees a pruning prank in the neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a violent film, but a bad film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the film was meant not to be taken lightly. The film appeared at the end of the second bright cycle, so it was certainly a reflection on the traditional bright elements, which were made in a cheeky way. For example, after the murder, Charlie goes to the "welcome" sign in the city and marks the population down. This thing can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are in miserable movies, be sure to watch this movie for sure. It's a bit different from your usual usual film with the possibility of killers, but not much. The comedy tells the audience to relax and not take the film, so God is serious. You may forget the movie, you may remember. I will remember that because I love the name.
