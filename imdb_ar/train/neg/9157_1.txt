The first idea that this is a cheesy film is that it was filmed on video, not film. The story is wrapped up, production is surprisingly dirty. Note, for example, that when the couple on a plane apparently landing in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their engagement at a civil union ceremony, the plane appears as it leaves for an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their celebration - in Fairmont - is held in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which will not last five minutes in the New England climate. On another plane flight, the formation of a FedEx cargo plane took off. Presumably they can only travel in guidance. As for the plot, this film expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's religious Christian brother, is being expelled from his church when the congregation learns that his brothers are gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually prepared Victor with a successful man to kill Ben and Arthur "to purge their souls of sin." Apparently no one in this church has heard of the Ten Commandments. Lola Jimmy Britt Jable, who was surprisingly effective like Arthur, would have no advantages at all.
