My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever. Certainly in the top ten of those I've seen all along. At least, Plan 9 was fun. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Christine, The Dead Zone, Firestarter, Carrie, and some of his other films. I did not care much about "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad on the versions I saw and I could not quite tell what people were saying) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Petemetery)". > <br /> But this chaos was a complete error in every way possible. The "creatures" looked the same by a 9-year-old boy. (There is no insult to the 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even the "individual lines" made us naive and we were not remotely amused.
