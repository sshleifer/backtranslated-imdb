I saw the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 pounds and House, M.D. The character of Tucci is wonderful but socially inefficient, as with House of Laurie, but without the sharp intelligence Laurie brings to House. In the meantime, Tucci's "straight man", the sure-to-be doctor Seger, has not been developed into a more interesting character, such as the wrong "straight men" Cody and Wilson. The character of Andrea Pharma Adrian Holland is very similar to Cameron doctor Jennifer Morrison so she is not associated with anyone else. <br /> <br /> Obviously someone at CBS noticed the success of Haus, MD, and demanded his employees get him (her) a similar offer, hoping the tradition would prove successful. However, copying a show like House requires the same high level of sophistication and sophistication and Tochi and the company is not only challenging. <br /> <br /> I did not know the offer was canceled until I read comments on IMDb, but it does not surprise me.
