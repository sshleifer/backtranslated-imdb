Nathan Detroit runs the illegal waste dumps in New York City, but the heat is on and he can not find a safe location. Betting on the chronic gambling Sky Masterson that Sky can not make the main missionary, Sarah Brown, come out for dinner with him. Sky faces the challenge, but the men have some surprises in the store? <br /> <br /> This is one of the 50's expensive MGM musical tunes, with great collections, loud music, larger roles of life and performances to match; Broadway pictured for the big screen if you like this kind of thing, which I do not like. My main problem in this genre of music is music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinoni to the ZZ Top, but Broadway shows tunes in a swinging time with the endless Bah-Bah-Tah-Dah trumpet at the end of each fourth bar. This was written by Mark Lisser, Mankowitz, Joe Suerling and Abby Burroughs (based on the stories of Damon Ronnion). While the plot was very weak, the songs were weak. Two figures, for example, are identical, unnecessary, do not go along with the plot, and get on the ears (they also hate obscene women if this bothers you). There are only two unforgettable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit, You Rockin 'The Boat (performed by Kaye well) but you have to sit for two hours to get them. The winning film is a young brando that offers thoughtful performance; it sings well and even dances a little, and is consistent with Simmons always interesting. The sequence where the two flee to Havana all night is a welcome respite from all the noise and bustle of Noel Yok. Music fans may dig this, but from my point of view, the musician has to do more than just film the play.
