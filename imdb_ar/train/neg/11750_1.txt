The person who has written and directed and gazed at this dreadful piece of garbage should really think about changing the caregiver. Yes Rob Stephanieuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this crap? There are many talented writers who can spend money on them better. I think the idea is fantastic but the representation, text and output is awesome! Jokes are not very funny, I understand that they are supposed to take Mickey. However, this film screams in 1995 for Saturday. Why, I say again why studios give money to piracy such as Rob Stephanieuk - never give the comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his film. DUH!
