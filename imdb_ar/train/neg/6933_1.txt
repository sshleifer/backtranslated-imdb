For other Colombo films, this can only be classified as 1 (bad). I do not seriously understand what other reviewers have seen in this horrific incident in a film. I did not watch him except through the patient fascination - to find out any strange or incompetent decision the director would take later on. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that it was a walk-through Falk's only because it interferes with acting acting. In fact, I think the real reason lies in the heads of the studios, who must be terrified when they see what he did with their money. It's no wonder they did not kill him.
