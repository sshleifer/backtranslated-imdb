I really mean. This will not help the Australian film industry make this type of film without any value of any kind. Well, if you're stuttering and you do not have anything better, maybe. I think filmmakers here should try to show the rest of the world what great talent has, and this is not the appropriate tool. Come now, this movie is just tacky.
