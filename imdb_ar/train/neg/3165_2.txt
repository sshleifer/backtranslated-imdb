This movie was terrible. I thought with all the decent actors, would be better. do not waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrifying. Housewives must be desperate. Paul Rod became a representative b. His mess in the film and I could not be a woman is an example of what I'm saying. The bell lake was nice but definitely needed more acting lessons. Watching just like paradise with Reese Witherspoon ... was the best boy. Or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful that you did not waste your precious time. PS: I love you are also good from behind serious romance! It's time to start watching movies that have been rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it
