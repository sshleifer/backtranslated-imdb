What a huge pile of manure. Shot on video (really a crappy, non-digital video camera) a pile of trash. It is by far the most stupid thing. The fact that this crap actually released is quite asanine. Anyone who sees this will become stupid to watch. seriously. She felt that she had killed several brain cells after seeing this garbage. Obviously, the positive reviews of this crap $ $ made by the "director" (I use the term "very loose") himself and / or his family and friends because no ordinary person has the intelligence of the squirrel will frankly love this waste of life. Trust me, stay away from this video. You will thank me for that. Avoid it like herpes.
