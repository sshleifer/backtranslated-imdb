The Russian film "4" follows the lives of three people (not four) strangers who meet one night at a local pub. One is a musician, a frozen meat seller and the other a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4", I gather, aims to show the gloom of life and despair in post-Soviet Russia (characters to make the stories to make their lives look more interesting than they already are), but the film is so incoherent and boring I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit all the way. There seems to be a suggestion that the mysterious Russian government is based on some suspicious behind-the-scenes work - the operation of clandestine reproduction facilities and the sale of frozen meat that has lasted decades and so on - but the film has no shape and can not be understood to the extent that I suspect anyone can know What anyone really deserves here. <br /> <br /> Despite decent representation and a few carefully guided scenes, "4" is a two-hour stamina contest to be avoided at all costs.
