I saw this film, along with all the other adaptations I could get - including watching the plays - in preparation for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as is music. Unfortunately, all life was taken out of the story. I have not seen such a terrible picture of Mr. Rochester. All his basic qualities are over. Where is the wit? Where is his passion? Rochester Scott is more like the frustration of Rochester, St. John, than the character of the novel. In fact, the St.John actor played in this adaptive St.John passionate role while Scott was satisfied with smashing things or just staring at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking about. I would like to give this film a little louder based on music and cinema, but frankly I can not bear to see this film for a long time because of George C.'s performance. Scott.
