I totally hated the film. He was very retarded. They need to get some acting lessons .... No, wait, this will not help because the band Naked Brothers Band is delaying. You know why I'm here even though I hate the Nude Brothers band? To warn people before they watch the stupid movie so NBB gets no money from it, so they can not produce stupid stupid songs that any older man can write in 10 seconds. Not only are the lyrics of the song retarded, they sing badly. Well, I kind of like the movie here ..... Anyway, it was boring and they were acting horribly. It was not funny at all though they tried hard to do it. I think they deserve some credit for it ... Well, the film is not worth your time. Just look at their classification. The movie (and serial) is very painful to watch anyone with half a brain. Seriously, if you love it, then you need to watch movies where the actors actually act, and not stumble upon their lines in monotony. I'm in a drama club at my school and some people are actually better than these guys Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of the stern. I do not even know why I passed half the movie. I do not think it's even worth calling it a movie ...
