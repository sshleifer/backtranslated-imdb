The story begins slowly and nothing funny happens for a while. All the events in the end, but you will not have to laugh because the film funny, but because the story pathetic. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part is when Harvey is "not a paranoid" Keitel really loses and begins a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
