I was looking forward to seeing Nana after I saw Renoir's first startling work, The Whirlpool of Fit. I had read that Nana was considered the best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it looked like a big step back. <br /> <br /> Katharine Heisling is the main problem in this film. Her representation is the best, even for the silent film. Her representation is like what one would expect in a film of early teens, not the late twenties. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) to someone suffering from constipation pain. It was also very hard to believe that any man would fall because of this sedition. There was nothing enchanting about her at all. <br /> <br /> The film was also long, and the camera work was uninterested (along with a snapshot of the horse race) and the adjustment was dim. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora. It is interesting to compare the two because there is only 3 years between these films. Pandora's Box is simply scored on every level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir compilers or very serious silent film lovers.
