Wonderful. This was probably DCOM's worst ever. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with her hot boyfriend Jock and clings to friends who are determined to be Queen of Homecoming. She is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and Xin comes to help her to help her in the martial arts. She teaches them the skills of the snake, the tiger, etc., and she has to learn certain ways to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for children who want to learn martial arts and Chinese culture, but acting and acting were terrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian and I can not see her playing a dangerous role. He was laughing loudly watching her scream at Shin. Chen could not act at all, and everything was unreasonable at all. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing I reached was Power Rangers. This film is very fake and the stunts were so exciting that he was very angry. The characters were not likable and I could not stand to watch them. Disney really needs some time to produce some decent movies. High School Musical is the only film to be on the Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It, Weep, and Stuck in the Suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like adventure and favorite jokes, you will love this movie.
