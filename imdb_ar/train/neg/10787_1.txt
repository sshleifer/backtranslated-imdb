Let me put it another way: balls. Or, what about bollo * ks. This is really terrible, and more embarrassing than those who try to ridicule it. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, usually her work at the highest level. This film lacks direction until you struggle to look ingenious. The professional is usually ingenious, but I swear that in her eyes there were signs of confusion and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that might have saved this move is the idea of ​​director (Chris Welken) converting the film into a secret documentary about actors. Unfortunately, this topic is not explored because it has full potential. Very little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was woody, and Kozak Kozak, Crystal should be committed to acting. The two talented former stars of Buffy had different experiences - desperate desperate greens, Balfour's lack of use. Well done to Julia just to prevent this from being the worst movie ever.
