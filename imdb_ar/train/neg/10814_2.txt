As a Jane Eyre fan, I was excited when this film came out. "Finally," I think, "someone will turn this book into a movie that follows the story actually written by the author." If the casting director intends to photograph "Jane" who was clear, he certainly succeeded. However, it is certain that he can find the person who can act as well. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the frightening suspense of the novel when the laughter seemed to appear at night seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the luster of the child who danced and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot eventually changed? One wonders if a scriptwriter has already read the book. What a disappointment
