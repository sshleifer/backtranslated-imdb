The story of the film is bad enough, which can occur in real life. I very much can not understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is a reason. 1. If Madonna is rich and can do whatever she wants, why fall in love with this bad guy. 2. How can the script be a very weak story? She was very rich, she could do whatever she wanted, but she dared not divorce her husband and this is very impossible. <br /> <br /> Words that I love you mean nothing in this film.
