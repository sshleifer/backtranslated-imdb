As a shepherd priest I heard good things about this film. Then I saw it. Acting was not the best. This can be forgiven. This is not the message: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll do better, make the catch amazing, stop feeling, start with the landing passes, and even make the playoffs. All this because Jesus magically transforms into terrible weaknesses for American athletes. I laughed loudly when the coach transferred the Bible to explain why he kicked the field goals. But hey, that's not all. You'll get a new truck, an increase of $ 6,000, and you and your wife will end up with infertility suddenly in pregnancy - twice. Then she will win the state championship because God helps in a weak kick the goal of winning the pitch 12 yards from his kick before - and in the wind - not least - all because "God wanted him to do so." Then will win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus with all their hearts. <br /> <br /> Here's what he took from the film: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to - and it's all about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chose his favorite team and helped them win the matches. Which Bible depends on this story? I bet that St. Stephen wished he knew the keys to this safe life before stoning him to death. Someone had to make this film before he killed 10 of the 11 apostles to follow Jesus. It would save them a lot of trouble.
