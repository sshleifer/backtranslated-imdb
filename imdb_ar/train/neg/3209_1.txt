I also saw this amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the London Science Fiction Festival. If you want to see this thing, do it with a large audience and preferably after a little beer, you can then have some fun from it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue joyful, and I found in my mind an introduction to the Holocaust. Awesome animation. It was poorly designed and poorly executed. Perhaps it was a good idea for producers to appoint at least one person who was not blind. <br /> <br /> There's nothing else really saying, this movie is a failure on every level.
