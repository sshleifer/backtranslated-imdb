This film is very creepy indeed. Unfortunately, not for the reasons that will be hoped by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> There is a domineering murderer, too, but he is not. It is just your evil comic book, a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Krueger, although there is nothing new to add to either. By the way, even for the most brutal and most repugnant criminals, can they be chained up in stress mode, on their feet, arms outstretched 24 hours a week a week? I assume in the world that Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay gave us anything possible. <br /> <br /> No, what is really creepy in this film is the central character, Danny. This unattractive young man, with the help and instigation, is true through some cynical security arrangements and a doctor who is fully interested in any idea of ​​professional ethics or patient confidentiality, wandering around the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a very weak young and unarmed woman, The absence of anything (chronic sleep prevents her from being able to give anything like informed consent) imagines himself to have a kind of special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> It seems that within days, West has the right to kidnap her, believing (quite falsely, as we discover) that he is more capable of caring for her than anyone else, and within minutes of returning her to his apartment, he sexually harasses Although she (again because of her drowsiness) is completely unable to consent or resistance. <br /> <br /> Our doubts about why he feels this relationship are confirmed soon. Of course, he is somehow unable to form any friendships for mature adults, let alone sexual relations, so she instead retreats from this mainly infantile woman, who because of her permanent sleep has a mental age that is compatible with a life experience that does not exceed a few years. The scene where ice cream is discovered makes a frenzy, and the look she knows quietly when she tells him that he will have to clean it again causes a special jolt of terror. But again, I am afraid, this is not the terrifying horror that filmmakers hoped, but a more pronounced spasm of anger. All of us can clearly see what is happening at the end of our throats here - it is the ideal pidophil dream of innocence, sexual compliance and total dependence. Horrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> What do we have in this mashed mash? Twisted dreams are not as good as Del Toro. The mandatory argument "You need to go to the police", where the leading figure always has a reason not to do so, although it is the only reasonable course of action. The sequence of autoplay, which has been greatly praised in the comments here, although it is completely useless ("It serves nothing!", As Sigourney Weaver invisibly protested in the Galaxy Quest) and looks exactly like the doctor Phibes Phibes Consider a publication of its derivatives. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs is doing his best, so a star for it, and two others because you must keep lower ratings for the movies that are worse, and in general this is a good shot and performing efficiently.
