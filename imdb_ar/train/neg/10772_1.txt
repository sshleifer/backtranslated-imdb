The worst part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes I will not go back. I realized that this was terrible from the beginning, as the man was dressed as a crazy Indian president over the roof. (See whether they can get rid of it in 2008). My 10 year old son really enters baseball now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Although he seemed to enjoy parts of it, I had to bother when I heard all the unnecessary obscene language. Bad movie, bad. This was a terrible rupture of bad news bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I do not mind if a film is predictable if it is good, but this film is not.
