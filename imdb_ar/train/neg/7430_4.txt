It is interesting to know the shape of the life of Pierce Brosnan before the arrival of Bond to the scene. In this "strained" film, Pierce Brosnan plays the role of Patrick Latif, who leads the ghetto children in "trust courses". He is a romantic woman, has a mop-level baby top swamp in the mid-nineties called Eric. The drunken ex-husband soon arrives at the scene and begins to mess with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point, Pierce makes a "vegetable" parrot. Enter the husband. Pearce resumes making vegetables. Then the husband attacks Pierce. Small pieces of half-vegeburger eating call fall from Pierce's mouth. The battle ends abruptly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
