An awesome and mischievous attempt to implant a personal sheriff bar from Mel Brooks Saddle in the weekly sitcom, this is really bad as some people say! <br /> <br /> The Laughter Path serves only to remind the non-Muslim viewer of what all this comedy is meant to be a joke and how much laughter it really is! He did his best to impersonate Little Cliffon. His embarrassment appears in every scene. It's been more entertaining in HBO El Diablo than it was here in this cheese slice! <br /> <br /> Truly, the best thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
