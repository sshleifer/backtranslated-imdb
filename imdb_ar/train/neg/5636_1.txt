This was the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no conspiracy, but the time you realize that this movie goes far beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch a long time close to recognizing the director's complete incompetence, also known as the laziness that plays the clutches in the movie , And we do not believe that Willem Dafoe in this film, it is a reproduction, because the real Dafo, as we know from "Apocalypse Now" and "Saints Bon Bon", will never agree to such a scenario. <br /> <br /> Duo, (Da) wrote the enemy of this bill with twenty years minus his infant. The film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Davo and Colandrand, then scriptwriter, Davo and Colandrand, and then director Colagrandi. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (The Story); Widow meets a young man, Guy Blasts widow, widow smashes windshield with a man who hates her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; Black Widow (different title, same nonsense). <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie !!! It's total waist time!
