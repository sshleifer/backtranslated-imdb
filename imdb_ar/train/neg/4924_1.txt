This movie is really bad. It may be harsh, but it is. It really is. A bad scenario, all the vampire cliches are used in the book, and no sympathy is ever offered to the principal personal origins ... ie the first Dracula. There have been some really wonderful Dracula / vampire movies in the past, but that does not make them into the "dire" box. <br /> <br /> Choose a group of people who seem to have emerged from a teeny step, add dribbling from Dracula Lohr and mix in an intoxicating tonic of the religious / surreal dream ... and get a confusing mess from a movie - Dracula 2000. < /> <br /> I really can not find any good things to say about this movie, as if it was not bad enough because it was created in the first place, and they seem to have made the impact of Johnny Lee Miller an English accent ... what is The problem I hear is you cry ... well, it's English, but it looks like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> In general, you can also tell your money (if you're thinking of buying it)) or rent it out and watch it and discover for yourself why it's scary like Tlyttubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Although not too scary!
