Yes, it was the first "howling" classic. I started a fairly good waswolf film I admit it started slowly, but it gained momentum along the way to get a pretty good touch and then the announcer turned into a cute wolf just to be shot in the camera. Yes, it was confirmed that the horror horror film was certain ... forget all because this film has nothing to do with this film. Sure, they have made it clear that the announcer is the same and that her brother or something wants to know what and why things went down as they did, but they move from the comfortable little retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they have to fight the evil witch wolves or something Such. I often wonder what Christopher Lee was doing in this film in the world, but I read the trivia here saying he was not in the movie Wolf before, but I still read the script before it plays a role. Maybe you've got in the "American hell in London" which could have been possible. He was appointed in London after all. Heck, wolves do not seem to represent much in this film except for a strange and long-term sexy scene. In fact, the most distinctive death in this film for me was when one gal started talking loudly and began to let this man bleed.
