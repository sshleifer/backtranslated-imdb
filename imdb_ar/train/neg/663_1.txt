Imagine the scenario - you're in the movie theater just because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you'll end up in museums. You think you might go to see Sarah Marshall's movie as the trailer seems so and you do not need to attract your mind. It sold out. Options? - Bank function, in Bruges, Leatherheads or night prom. I've seen Bank Job (an amazingly decent theft film) and in Bruges (again, very good) so you're in a second. You do not imagine watching Clooney or the gentle of Office running around in the 1930's football uniform, so you see the right night prom? Error. You take $ 8.50, walk to a stranger on the street and ask him to trust you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. <br /> <br /> It's actually more a comedy of horror / excitement or anything you're supposed to be. If I'm funding this film and they show me that as a final story I will not know whether I'm laughing or crying. Maybe both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... My roommate was laughing loudly in the bulk of the film. As for acting, they might have thrown robots (or maybe dogs) into the roles, and they were more realistic. The detective should be the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Kristensen (I hate to represent him a lot and do not care how to spell his name) You feel comfortable with your nickname (s) <br /> <br /> So briefly "
