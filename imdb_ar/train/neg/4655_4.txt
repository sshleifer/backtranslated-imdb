I wanted to give the blood fee the benefit of initial suspicion. The opening moments, with a nude woman spread and painted, Diana, is about to paint and then suck her blood to drain so she can use it in her art, giving the impression that this may be an art from the kick of the ass. Vampire Vampire. This initial impression becomes a mistake. Oh, Troma, a sign of a kind of lack of quality: sometimes they will offer something rude but funny with some efficiency at least in a junk food (or sometimes not). This is a case where there is not much fun to see if his attempts at humor (that is, the father of the protagonist is an old vodafone doing impressions of Jimmy Durante?) Are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs undermined by Sergio Lapelle's bargain basement approach. <br /> <br /> This is not without him trying, Lord do not. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producer had money for the lights, but the way they used it in the film made me, a former filmmaker and aspiring director, sitting in my seat. If I saw that in a theater, I had to blind the eyes in many cases and I would wonder if His DP really understands the lighting set as 3 key points or not. Although this, along with a very weak voice design (or just a loud buzzing sound as in the Art Gallery scene), should not be something to draw attention to during the Troma version, but it must be something essential * for a film director who can Even if the script is not funny or very scary (and not so) or if LaBelle is doing a strange mix of songs placed in strange moments. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie at all, and maybe if you're a tense vampire (or just a vampire period), it might have some appeal as a lower alternative to a low-rent deal, or a slight improvement, for example, 1972. You have better ways to waste time in general.
