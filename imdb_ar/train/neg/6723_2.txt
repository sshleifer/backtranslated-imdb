Charlotte's killer beauty and deadly kicks make the movie cooler than if it were otherwise. The story is very bad and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way, wondering if this is the end they thought of in this film. I hope someone says that there is an alternative end, but I'm afraid it will not happen. As for the rest of the cst, well, I say they simply did not act well; although it should blame the script badly. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Zai died in a silly way, because she was the only one who stole the show throughout the film. I can give this movie 2/5
