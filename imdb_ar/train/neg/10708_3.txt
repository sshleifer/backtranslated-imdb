This film has the potential to be really good, keeping in mind that some elements of the plot are borrowed from the science fiction actor The Hidden. And Dolph always gives some cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone really threw the ball in this place. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk recently (!) travels to New York to retrieve a key that opens a door behind his monastery and incarceration of the Antichrist. For 2000 years. He must fight the client, who is the spirit of jumping from one body to another like a hiding place and Jason goes to hell. The client, of course, wants the key so he can get out of the Antichrist. Alongside the ride, there is a disturbing antidote scientist and she and Dolph are chasing with the bodies owned by the client. <br /> <br /> If you make this sound amusing, forget it. The speed is very puzzling and slow, Subaru representation at best, fighting scenes poorly organized. Dolff walks through his role and publishes some of the worst dialogue in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor actually rises in the end when the client fights an army of heavily armed monks in the monastery, but the rest of this flick is snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
