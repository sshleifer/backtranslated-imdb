This song keeps humming in my head. Not the greatest song, but it was in the eighties. The film revolves around a major "supposed" singer killed while being charged with murder, chasing his girlfriend, who is sung in his band. The main singer named Billy "Eye" (yes, on the right) died two years later and his band returned to attend a concert only the lead singer is the lead singer this time. Bailey haunts her and eventually kills them. She kills all these people and frightens the girl and makes the people around her think about something wrong with her and imagine things. I finally decided to go to the cemetery and dig his grave to see if it was still there. You see that he is dead but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film, we find out why Billy has a brother named John (again directly). John acknowledges that he is jealous of his brother and that he killed all these people and returned him to blame for his brother and then took his girlfriend and terrified her for calling him crazy. The end is very cheesy and the representation is very lame and wooden. But .... I love it anyway. I watch it for the song. I wish I had.
