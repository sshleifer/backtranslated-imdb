This movie is very bad it's funny. He is starring Scott Bacula as a coach, but that's not important. What's important is his huge black teammate who plays the first round. First, he must be at least 75 years old, yet still plays a small baseball league, and secondly begins the film abroad despite his inability to walk, let alone running. Coach Bacola brilliantly transfers him to the first reference to the fact that when he tries to run he stays in the same place for a very long time. Backula shows a brighter training strategy at the end of the film (SPOILER), and tells the player "Downtown" by hitting him on the pitch, and it is clear that the "downtown" is a good move. He has achieved great success at home and won the title of his team, a small league team playing with the Twins who were of the category of major disciplines in the film. Now if Tony Mosser, manager of the Royals club, will be a smart coach like Bakula and ask his players to get up easily to home in every battle.
