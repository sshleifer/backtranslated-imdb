Tim Robbins Humidly here, being selected as a garage mechanic in New Jersey in the 1950s, he falls in love with a fake blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although it's on the screen a lot of time, Robbins only eliminates the inner workings of his intense personality and fades in the background (easy to forget that even in the picture!). A romantic comedy is combined with a gimmick, being Walter Matau playing the role of Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonized character). Other than that, it is rich and sunny, directed by a somewhat sleepy Fred Chipsy, who shows the heart without wit or brains. Meg Ryan is herself the usual friendly and chemistry between them and charming Robbins, like a loving sister and her great brother. ** from ****
