Obviously I did not care about the things that come (nicknamed "Shape of Things to Come") as far as most viewers are interested. This means that there is a good chance that you will enjoy it more than you enjoyed it. In any case, you may find it helpful to hear a movie described from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who was very experienced as a production designer and even as an artistic director, this is a film by HG Wells for his novel of the same name. In my view, this helps explain why the great novelist does not necessarily become a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film begins in 1940 in London's Everytown. War brewing and Everytown citizens are worried that they may reach them. Yes it is. And turns into a long relationship that extends to decades that destroy civilization fundamentally. Wales and Menzies continue to jump forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one dropped, reconciling with the consequences of the fighting. We meet a post-apocalyptic society ruled by a potential warlord. We meet a man from a prosperous future society. See how technology is changing. Finally, we have taken full account of this future society around 2036, where leaders discuss the advantages of sending humans to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may sound very exciting, but it may be very exciting, just not working as a movie. Structurally, the film is very remote, with little to tie it up dramatically. In the third part, I completely lost interest in trying to trace the characters. I barely managed to sort them out in the first couple slices. There is a constant procession of new faces. We do not know anything about any of them. <br /> <br /> This does not help that individual parts, except for some exceptions, tend to be unusually directive and editable. As they manipulate from time to time - can begin to feel like a propaganda film. But it may be paradoxical. The sections are also cool and somewhat dry emotionally. <br /> <br /> In fact, a long clip looks like a promotional video / industrial music video. If the footage includes building a future city, with lots of big machines, lots of welding, and so on. At some point, the astronaut-like man is waving the camera through a kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between military grade and exaggerated horror. I can not say that "the things that come" consist of engaging material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the common cry for supporting "things that come" is that it is a "film about ideas". This may be true, but there are some problems with this if we look at this path. First, it is still not successful - as a film, ie as a visual and audiovisual work, and two, there are many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is that war is what it does for civilizations. This is a good thing to make a movie about. It is also one of the highlights of the Second World War, where things were written and photographed in 1935 (issued in 1936). Wales has some interesting things about the war, some of which conflict with the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the end seems to indicate another outbreak of war, or will erupt at any moment. The public message seems pessimistic. The wells seem to show that war is simply part of human nature that can not be excluded, although it does not prevent "progress" - in fact, progress may feed, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> This will certainly be enough for a single movie. However, there are many ideas here. The scene between the pilots is one of the most moving scenes of the film. It deals with a complex dilemma. One of the pilots dropped the other, but now he is coming to help him. But the pilot, who was shot down, was carrying poisonous gas that was now rising through the field. They can not breathe both gas without harm. Girl come along. They only have two gas masks working between them. The dropped pilot offers his mask, as he says he dies anyway. what should I do? It is not that this scene itself can be extended to length, but the ideas - the strange complex of helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of war - are enough to build a film on. <br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes that show the potential warlord, in a post-apocalyptic environment, there is a contagious infectious disease called "wandering sickness" around him. The victims turn into something like drunk zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims at the site in an effort to ward off the disease. These materials are treated as if they were a later idea. It's a great idea and deserves her own film. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Wales presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for his own film, too. It is impossible to deal effectively with a lot of things in 100 minutes, especially when it is supposed to be the essence of the film rather than a dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to give things to come at least one offer. If you are a science fiction fan at all, this is a historically important film. Due to Menzies background, the production and designs of the group are interesting, even if the cinema looks very dated. It is also interesting to see how Wales was either spiritually or spiritually retroactive in his "predictions." I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which strongly reminded us of George Milice's 1902 "Journey to the Moon" (also known as Le Voyage dans la lune). Do not expect too many things to come.
