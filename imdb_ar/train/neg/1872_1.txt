be cerfull. This movie is such a mess. It is a disaster. Do not waste your time with this one. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, story, dialogue, and music ... Basically, everything is over in the foreground, it's very annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw it (if the dialogue / acting / story does not, everyone shoots it). You will feel you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the supposed funny parts are not funny. Acting, story, cinematography, you can feel that everything trying to experience WAAAAY is very hard - but it will never work. Practically every shot is dipped but what? This movie looks like a student film. No wonder they filmed this with high accuracy because it would be a waste to spend more money to film this on the film. <br /> <br /> If you easily enjoy or like bad acting, writing, editing, directing or full cliches, everything is imposed on your face, oh, and have you mentioned the bad representation? (Well, in fact, not all of that is the actor's fault - it's the director!) Then I think you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this for a semester. You may turn it off immediately if you can. If you still can not figure it out now, you have hated this movie. It made me want to lie down and restore my time ... at least I did not have to pay for the garbage. <br /> <br /> As you know ... Jeff Goldblum, the man from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, is present in this film, but he certainly has since retreated - where he has accepted roles for films such as this disaster.
