I do not know about you, but what I like about Tom and Jerry is the interaction (often violent) between the two people. Mouse in Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom to succeed in New York, and for me, this adventure certainly suffers from a lack of cat! <br /> <br /> A wizard like Jerry's exploration of "Big Apple may be" for other T & J fans who hung here on IMDb, I could not wait until this lax self-contained garbage ended, so I can watch the following animation on the DVD. <br /> In fact, the only part of the full episode I really enjoyed was when Jerry bought the farm almost, hung uneasily off the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy road.
