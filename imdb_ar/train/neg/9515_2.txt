Well, I've seen the original French version. But I can not imagine that this is better through translations. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that this movie is the most boring film in a long time. There are almost no replacement properties for this movie. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. It may be somewhat realistic but it is better to leave some real stories motionless. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow-moving films as long as they serve the purpose of the film. Tarkovsky Solaris is very slow but allows reflection and adjusts the mood of the film, for example. But in this case, the film is presented only with a mindless dialog box that can tell us a bit about the characters. Nothing I can recognize or care about. In many scenes, I found myself thinking: "When will you be silent?" The acting was very bad. Not in an exaggerated way. But none of the actors seemed to care about their personalities and they all seemed to want to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This may be because the dialog box is not inspiring. I also felt the full flow of the film completely mechanical. Move from scene to scene. This film seems to have been just written (badly) but never directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films I can say that generated no emotional response from any of the scenes. There is no suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no hope, no stimulation of my mind, no attention to the above. <br /> <br /> An ideal example of what I call a hostile film.
