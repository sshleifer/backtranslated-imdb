It ended with the slashes around 88, so it's time to get into these old movies. The script reminded me intelligently, the program reminded me of the video, but in a more disruptive way than before. Representation can pass by. But these are the effects that make you laugh, the so-called Brin is really Turkey and never shows blood. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are done wonderfully and reminds me of Nightmare on Elm Street and remember the phone that comes alive .... some how you can keep watching this flick, waiting for what happens next. It can be seen for all freaks because there are no stitches in it, and as blood is said to be nonexistent, but there is nudity to the perverts. I've seen worse movies than this movie, I just wish it made it more bloody ...
