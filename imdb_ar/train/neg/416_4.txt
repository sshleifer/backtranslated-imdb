(Some spoilers) - as if you do not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. Very good commercial, director like Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, as well as a very interesting subject - Disappearance. Every premise has been achieved for a wonderful movie. Unfortunately, these things were not important at all. The film was very week-old, without suspense and horribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a group of scientists who have discovered the disappearance. After the tests on the animals are successful, Kevin Bacon decides to test it himself. Once it is invisible, it changes completely, and realizes the advantages of not seeing it. From this to murder there is a very fine line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick film. The disease suffers from many new films: special effects. From a challenging subject that can lead producers to a great psychological thrill, Verhoeven destroys everything that focuses only on special effects, without giving a damn about the true value of the film. I have to admit that Forex is great, and it's probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. Actually this is the problem with movies today. Like Verhoeven, most directors are interested in just the stunning scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and perhaps Matrix is ​​the only film that combines quite impressive special effects and brilliant plot. <br /> <br /> After Starhip Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. Instead of a wonderful movie, the HM is cr * p. There are only two reasons for watching this movie: 1. Special effects 2. Joking with Superman and Wonder Woman. <br /> <br /> Well, then what's wrong with the film? everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- He's not nervous at all. It should be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- Very predictable. You know from the start who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - Lots of cliches. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bad guy wakes up several times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As with all low-quality horror, the first rule is to allow the characters as separate as possible. Every time someone is in the laboratory, the perfect victim of bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. For example: At first, bacon must scan his finger to enter the laboratory. After being invisible, how could he do that? <br /> <br /> --- END: It is very terrible. <br /> <br /> After Shue hit the bacon in the head, the bacon fell to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then he wakes up the bacon, and attacks them, "kill him" again. Then Shui shouted "I heard the sound of an explosion" (happened minutes ago), then suddenly ran inside. Did not you hear this explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhofen, I expected you a lot! <br /> <br /> If this is about Hulu Man. What was supposed to be a wonderful film turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
