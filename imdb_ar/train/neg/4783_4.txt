This is another bad movie you might have to avoid watching. The plot can be bigger "thickening" than it actually is and will be better as a popular genre. <br /> <br /> Acting is desirable, although you can not put your finger on what it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you watch on TV late at night, maybe in the USA, just because you can not sleep. Watch it if you want but do not expect too much of it.
