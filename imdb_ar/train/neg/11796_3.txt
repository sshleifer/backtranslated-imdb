Nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Fat Beach. However, do not hire it and definitely do not buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However, there were hidden jokes and comments I laughed at. If you're looking for a very funny "hood" movie, check out Friday. If you are looking for a strong emotional movie (something that tries this film in ... of its kind) see something like a chuckle dreams or Jason Lrake's song. If you're looking for some good "booty" black, look for Dominique Simon's pornographic watch, because nudity in this movie is almost non-existent. However, if you do not have something better to do and this was on the cable, keep watching it. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
