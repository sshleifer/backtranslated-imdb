This is the kind of film one sees in a very horrified silence, yet continues to watch it, mesmerizing, as if watching the wreck of a train in a slow motion. However, in the back of your mind, thoughts flounder: "Who has EARTH shed light on this litter?" <br /> <br /> Some of the previous user comments say things like, "a good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to children everywhere. The need for a kind of training plan to learn the love of comedic comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the fulfillment of the descriptions of the two stars Laurel and Hardy that I will answer: What then? One might think that the series of BOMBS series based on a popular series (Rocky and Polwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mood Squad, Nausea) taught Hollywood that there were some things that could not be recreated. Laurel and Hardy's movies are easily available on the video: Why do you care about this? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, a good actor in the theater and screen ... well, all I can say is, you should be in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, away from TV if this garbage has started!
