The basic premise of this film is political caricature. I suppose for those who do not know anything about the army facts that this film may be "good" about gender equality. In fact, a commentator recently said, "It allows women to know they can do anything they want." What a claptrap! No one, no man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "flies" in the SEEL Hell Week program of the 27-week BUD / S program with a few sessions at the local gym and her only desire is that the seal simply will not Make it as well. There is nearly 80% dropout rate in what can be said to be the harshest military training program - those who leave voluntarily, can not compete on a physical level, suffer from frequent physical injury during training or can not handle psychological harassment. I have never exceeded the shallowness of the alleged alleged message to this film. In the real world, Demi will not continue during the first 24 hours of this harsh and continuous physical training. Those who wish will not. Skip this movie as a wishful thinking, and spend your time better reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what is already going on in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
