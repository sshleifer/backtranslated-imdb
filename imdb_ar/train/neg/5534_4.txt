I work my way through Horror Classics 50 and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES. I watch them with my seven-year-old daughter, making most of these films laugh. <br /> <br /> I had great hopes in the zombie revolution, after watching the movie White Zombie, which is in fact an introduction to many of the basic pillars of zombie cinema (Clive Barker thought the rainbow snake and the scene of Live and James Bond funeral, not night Dead living). <br /> <br /> However, although the title includes the word "zombie", it is nothing more than a love triangle, in which the anthropologist Armand Loki, who is fond of Claire Duval, Grayson. What a festival of yawn, my daughter fell asleep half way. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time deciphering the work of these people - allies or axis; but, I think that does not really matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bella Lugosi in the credits of this film; but of course his eyes (from White Zombie) were a mind-control tool for zombies.
