Certainly the product of young minds, this piece may attract the audience of the twenties, who are still trying to find their place in the world, while grabbing all the nerves. However, I can not imagine that the sheer amount of cynical narcissistic stare, vulgar humor, or familiar subject matter would be particularly attractive to anyone over the age of 30. The other problem is that the peripheral characters, who obviously have no disdain for filmmakers, are distanced from these ridiculous cartoons of comic influence, so they can not be linked in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, one has to give some pattern points to filmmakers, who grew up clearly in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book to create a non-existent scheme otherwise. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of the festival's dear ones. Second, although we live in the era of YouTube, everyone's narration of their mundane lives deserves treatment on the big screen. But these young filmmakers have every right to produce their film, and if others in their twenties can find something to get to know, that would be better. However, I could only think at the end of this film how this newer generation, which has just reached maturity, will be in a real world that presents many challenges and complications. In an age when every child is constantly reassuring to the point of being distinctive, and everyone deserves 15 minutes of exposure, flexibility and ability to deal with adversity, does not seem exactly a strong point for this generation.
