He burst into tears to watch this movie. Not from the laugh but from the memories of Rodney Dangerfield's great film. Candyshack was his first and stole the film, and Easy Money had it at its best, and back to school is by far a classic masterpiece in the 1980s. Then there were beetles and this when they started showing up. The poor Rodney was getting older ("Sparx" was a simple step from "beetles" but did not say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives, Rodney plays Monty (a name he should love since his name is in Easy Money), a rich man (not always) who loves women and marries like nothing to him. Well, he inherits a huge piece of land now, and since the land was run by Amish, he inherits five wives. This sounds like a great idea for Dangerfield. The problem is everything. The text is so bad that Rodney seems to be telling him his linings in the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. The movie looks like it was filmed on video with some really nasty stunt sequences obviously not Rodney. Andrew Des Clay plays a gangster who seems to die to say the word "F" (which he should have done since the movie was rated as R but plays as PG) and Jerry Stellar has a lovely veil two minutes that will not miss me, Some Rodney jokes, but the poor man has become very slow and very slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. The film turns into a very personal computer, thanks to the terrible 1990s, and Rodney no longer works in the 1970s and 1980s.
