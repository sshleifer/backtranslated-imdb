If you want to get out of a good movie for Jason Scott Lee, I recommend: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> " Timecop 2: Berlin's decision "is a terrible film. The production values ​​are terrible. The representation is terrible. Horrible script. I would not recommend watching this movie by anyone who seriously thinks that such a film is a high-quality entertainment or that offers American-Asian awareness in Hollywood. (This film does not.) <br /> <br /> I would at least say that this movie is Acceptable entertainment on a rainy day if you encounter it at any time while browsing the channel. If you're curious, you may be renting from Netflix, but this is definitely not a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who have seen this movie as a way of raising your awareness of the Asian-American film and disappointed, then recommend the following movies for your personal viewing. These well-written films with high production values ​​feature talented representatives of Asian-American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
