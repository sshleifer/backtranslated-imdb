Jesus Christ, I can not believe I waste my time watching this movie. I just watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this film almost left her. This is terrible too! I could see Survivor Series 93 on this. <br /> <br /> The lead man in this matter was nice and working. If Mistuharu Misawa Tiger DROVE '91' was to be ass through a glass window. I was angered every time he would say "lake" and "cabin". I kicked his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. Real angel. But she could not even save this absolute joke of a movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act as if she were far from the nut when she took the medicine. It seemed joyous. <br /> <br /> I also liked the thing that Jordan had accidentally plunged into. Remind me of this in time ... so how about you. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie because of its horror.
