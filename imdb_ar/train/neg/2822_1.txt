OMG This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and IV I've seen so much I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie will be in this film? Did you need money badly? I loved AJ and I saw almost everything I ever had so I watched this 2 mark one last off. Seo was bad! Not bad good, bad just bad. It had a funny little moments or 1 but all in all was a bad waste of 101 minutes. I can not even say AJ looks so good at it because it did not do well. The plot is predictable unless you expect to re-list Romeo and Juliet then not her. Every tour is disappointing. Maybe if you're 12 years old it might be a good movie or I would not really recommend it.
