The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like "The Man From Planet X," this is a strange science fiction story drawn from an age when fantasy and science fiction were still near the same. In other words, we have some very laughable special effects and the spread of pseudo-science masquerades as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" that was released with high-quality transitions with a clear image and a sharp voice - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's certainly the full time for our Mars crew. (What did you think of "Angry Red Planet" refers to Neptune?) Before that, there was a rather lousy space crew on a spaceship, smoking inside and roving in a sexy chauvinistic joke targeting the "obnoxious" member. the crew. It will be somewhat offensive to today's standards if it is not funny. But Mars is the real reason we watch this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars screams bloody red. Filmed in this strange strange red sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of excessive redness exposure. It is really a wonderful sight as is the case with foreign viewers (ha ha). Best to be "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think this is a joke? That's what they call the movie! It is a huge fantasy (a small doll) that combines the features of mice, bats, spiders and lobsters. It limits all dolls and frightens sh * t from our "heroic crew". There are strange foreigners, and poor perception, can be seen, but this person takes the cake. Eventually, after their horrific experience on Mars, the sexual bias crew escorts their "ship" and returns to whatever planet came from them. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Amateur science fiction movies, curiosity seekers, and some general movie buffs. Mystery Science Theater fans will have 3,000 field days with this day (if they do not participate in the show at all). <br /> <br /> 2/10 The recent score, 6/10 points Nostalgia, 4/10 in general. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
