This was better than the movie I thought of, because it was on the cable. I was expecting something like Melodrama cheese and the bad special effects seen in classics like Christmas Rush, First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen ... I particularly liked Ron Livingston as a Swat leader who was hard pressed. It is good to see him visiting the same article that he had a great fortune in the fraternity. The producers and designers did their duty because all the scenes and footage looked as if they were on that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So, if you get a chance to watch this movie, I'm sure you will re-run FX 50 Once ... take two hours and enjoy it.
