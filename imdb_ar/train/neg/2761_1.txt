Everyone does things that they regret later. The things they want to blame for drugs or alien possession. Things that seem rational at the time, but they later reveal that they are engraved calls for suffering and endless accusations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people, you sign the new Hammer note, and for others, you choose by intentional murder, while others send their bank accounts to third-world millionaires mysteriously tied for cash. <br /> <br /> For me it was a film. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars At the end of the day, I had to guess how this eco-friendly, fully recycled film would be from its faltering and repetitive title. But with my wish to disbelieve as it is, and a na√Øve belief from the magnificent poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Sadly, by the time the old man in the pawn made the entire back story clear, fifteen minutes after the picture, I had the sudden soaked revelation that comes from knowing each plot point of a film that is still not visible. Worse still: you know how poorly you absorb every point. <br /> <br /> Let me be quite clear here, English lacks the nuance and depth sufficient in the field of absolute evil to describe how bad this film really is. <br /> <br /> As for all the movie transitions, I was wrong. In the spirit of old Godzilla films, which do not deserve to fill these scales, additional subtleties appeared comfortably each time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> Close-up calls, miraculous flight, and concentrated deposits are full of unexplained anxiety. <br /> <br /> This movie is what happens if Mighty Morphing Power Rangers are given access to the national defense budget. And lots of alcoholic beverages. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you can get some of the finest musical tracks from the successful motion movies of the last decade: First, take the Star Wars Episode One starcraft's Amphibian Army and remove Prozac until they are ready for Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Next, get close to Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (so you can call him Ethan as a "hidden" signal to the "Mission Impossible" privilege) and give him plenty of movie narration, so no one gets confused while His attempt to follow the depths of their ideas. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a rude voice in a tapered armor worthy of the Yardal of the Rings and two giant cobra, angry at the deletion of their scenes from the latest version of King Kong, and put them all in any particular arrangement in Los Angeles talk. <br /> <br /> Now, go to the pharmacy to find something to treat sudden migraines. When you return, mix these ingredients until any hint of originality that is ignored is dissolved into a homogeneous mass of cheese and sub-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> At several points during this picture, I found myself saying aloud, "Make the movie bad," and break the tears. <br /> <br /> He described this movie as a "B" that would give him an unworthy show. After a summer school, and lots of physical therapy, you may pass a C-level movie if you can sleep in some way during most of it. <br /> <br /> In short, if you find yourself with money and brain cells burning, and the need to punish yourself for the unspeakable unspeakable sins against humanity, Dragon Wars may be just a movie for you.
