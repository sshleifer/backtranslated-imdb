There are some good things about the film. Music and cinematography are wonderful. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a wonderful performance. Ryan Power is also hot. The production was very lucky because they threw it because they really give the film production value. Johnny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of boys in the movie who do not speak very cute. Why is not the actress that plays Amy listed in credits? Brandon Alexander performs great comedy like Clarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about the film is James Townsend. Can not act it is also very lean, not nice to look at everything. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They do not have muscle tone at all. No wonder he made his own film and cast it. No one will put it in anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not certified as a person who can even have a girlfriend because he acts gay. They had to choose someone else as a leader if they wanted the best in the film. Then again, he might just want to use this film as a way to launch his career in soft flashes, and certainly not really true because he would take some acting lessons. In addition, anyone who is a pornographer is on the blacklist in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most ironic thing about the film is Latina's choice of tan skin as a mother of Daphne. Sonia Fisher does not seem an actress at all. All in all, this pornographic film is a kernel and not the best thing you see on Skinemax. I think Alex Wilson, perhaps the best thing in this film, is embarrassed by it and does not want to be associated with it. There is no image on his IMDb page and there is nothing else listed, so maybe Alex Wilson is a phase name that can be discarded. In addition, I encountered him in West Hollywood once recently and when I mentioned this movie, he turned around and went away. I understand. If I worked in this film, I would be embarrassed and would not want to join it either.
