This movie is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those films that children show on a rainy day at school when you can not go out for a holiday and you would rather watch anything, nothing else. At least that's what happened when I was in primary school. I just remember hate this film. Granted, I have not seen it in 15 years or so, and probably do not use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone: it would be best to use this to put your kids to sleep from entertainment with them. Trust me, choose anything else. Although the subject is controversial, the plot is so slow that I can not remember anything about it but I hate it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against it.
