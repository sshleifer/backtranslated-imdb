So what is the big fuss of making Indiana Jones wannabe when your actor casts the role of a fictional man from stories of adventure stories not wanting to go out on an adventure ??? The scriptwriter for the JAKE SPEED may have been released, but for whatever reason, this film lacks much excitement! This does not mean that he has no action, but look at the dark side of the picture. This must not resemble the similarities of INDIANA JONES or other excitement and adventure that contain cliffhangers and narrow escapes, JAKE SPEED has been promoted this way using clever propaganda to make me and many others interested in it! Moreover, I have never heard of a man, who needs his attention?
