After reading the other comments on this film, I would like to share my view that this is a difficult film to be seen only if you are entirely Brooksville. I'm not like this. <br /> <br /> When viewed as a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced story that offers us more non-expendable neurons than absorptive capacity in a single session. It's very hard to watch. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is not so sympathetic and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to it - not to mention its root because it stumbles from a dysfunctional dysfunctional state to another. He should not take a naked scene and is not expected to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man can have a lot of exposed foliage and is supposed to run a child like Katharine Harold ---- unless of course Albert Brooks is in a production run by Albert Brooks. Romance "has fun moments - but it is fragmented and rare ... More often than not, I felt as if I were on a trip with a perfectly loved person and I hope that it really ends, and confirms the problems that can occur when a lot of control is placed on the film.

"James explained to us how Albert could create a credible, entertaining, "Albert allowed us to see James (in general not cast the role of actor) playing a rare comedic in an amazingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Now the fans of" Modern Romance "moved on to the next binary comment about it. - There is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie dedicated to entertainment.
