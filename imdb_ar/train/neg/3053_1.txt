Wonderful. Who said Edward Wood Jr. had never affected anyone? Fumigation of donkey feces This is the ideal case. Makes "violent years" like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" makes the worst memories of Keith Richards look like the first nighttime emission. I had nightmares, you know, I woke up and burned, and never came close to the mysterious horror that Santa Claus discovered from soil that looked pure. However, I can think of some parties where this movie might actually go well. Also, if you're looking for a perfect example of the duo of Santa-Satan on the VHS tape, look no further. Do not check this movie, as I was told that the MST3K version is now available. Move the devil, here is Santa Claus.
