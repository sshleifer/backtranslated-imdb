Considering his popularity, I found this movie very disappointed. Maybe I was expecting a lot from this film. After all, it is one of the most famous martial arts movies of the 1970s, but I could not find out why. The story is not interesting. It is also a very attractive film with a sequence of intermittent motion. My biggest problem in the film was that the story did not offer a character I could get to, because the hero was an idiot. Zhang has no sense of elegance, and is unable to hide the stark flaws in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be a high art, but I found the film tedious. Certainly not the best example of this kind beloved. Her state of worship escapes me. I recommend you to skip it.
