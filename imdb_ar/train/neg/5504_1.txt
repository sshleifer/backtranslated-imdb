There is no possible reason why I can not understand why this film was ever shown. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to look for a terrible update for every classic film? (Examples: Mister Magu, Avengers - Horrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was very unhappy in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is indescribable in being a criminal. His screams, grudges, frustrations and histories do not give us any reason to look after his character except for cartoon figures of one dimension. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that quick movements and dialogue are shouting and "taking the person". "He had some resemblance to comedy, he seemed to tell each actor to act as if he had red ants in his clothes. <br /> <br /> The error should lie in the irresponsible script, I think the writer used "it's madness, madness, madness, madness" as an example of a good comedy scenario, regardless of the classic obsession of 1963, Much better than this film - in fact - seems suddenly good compared to it. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this film is that it must have been written to appeal to young children. I sure do not know which child respects himself and holds the card! <br /> <br /> If they have to reshape "Mars of choice", why not add some of the immortal charm of the original classic artist? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not consider "zero" as an assessment of its readers, and this is the only classification that comes to mind when describing this farce. <br /> <br /> One good thing happened from this movie, Paying fees to representatives and crew - I think.
