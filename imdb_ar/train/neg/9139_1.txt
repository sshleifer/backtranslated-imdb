I do not know what this film director Sam Marovic is about, somehow, spoiled every aspect of this film. I usually say that this film should not be present, but this film may be the most important at all. This film must exist for the sole purpose of "undoubtedly the worst film made." I've seen bad films in my life, but that somehow explains what I've seen as bad for something that's hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is fun, but the funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this movie great. <br /> <br /> Hey wow ...
