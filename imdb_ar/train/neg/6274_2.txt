I'm generous giving this 2 star movie. The line for "Have You Seen Even the Wizard of Oz" was the best part for me! With terrible writing and acting as shown in this film, it is no wonder that many real-life television programs are worthless. Go ahead and go home and hit the Royals baseball game, you'll be happy!
