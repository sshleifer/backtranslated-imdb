As usual, I do a crazy dash to watch movies I have not seen before in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to watching this movie because it looked like a sniper. For the rest of my life I can not understand why this film got the buzz it has. There is no story !! A group of men huddle around Iraq. One day, they are deploying a bomb here. Tomorrow they do the tools all over the countryside, themselves no less and start shooting snipers. Do not wait here they came back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so significant that they are just cartoons. I mean that we have a beautiful child who is afraid of death. We have a hardened military man who is practical and just wants a safe return. Then we have a reckless cowboy who does not follow the rules but has a quiet place for the little Iraqi toddler who is trying to sell DVDs to the soldiers. What do you think happens? Well, do you think that a cowboy who does not follow the rules will hit the beautiful child in his rebellious ways? why yes! Do you think that the Iraqi child owned by the cowboy soldier has a soft spot that will kill and injure him crazy? why yes! There is no story here. Scenario is a predictable event! The camera was shaken a lot to make it look "artsy". For all of you who think this is a great picture of war, go to "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money in this boring movie!
