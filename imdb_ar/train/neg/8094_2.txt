As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, I have a different view of why the film has faltered. First, any comparisons between the novel and the films are purely superficial. They are different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is likely to be limited to spelling, but as a cross between tragedy and controversy instead. Any comedic elements such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film's version are merely incidental to the author's monotonous approach. And so that the white writer who is everywhere thinks that this is Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the ghost of Ambrose Pierce in a hat and tails. Tom Wolf is part of an equal clown, as he is more famous than the author, always looking for a new mill for his own plant that he absorbs himself. <br /> <br /> So it's no wonder that the excellent production and direction skills in the film industry have been a success from the start. Unlike real satire, which translates well into a film, not based on controversy to observations universally accessible in one form or another of human behavior, but in a monolithic attack on certain people - whether real or imaginary - who somehow got angry Writer. Every effort must be made to create a successful story or story from the beginning, a clean start, free of writer influence or intervention. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find fault with the transmission. Not only are unqualified people like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith failing to rise, but those real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either completely wasted or given cartoon roles. <br /> There are enough topical stuff here to get a really great movie satire, but it fails to get close.
