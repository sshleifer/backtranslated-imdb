I felt bad for the actors in this thing. There is no doubt that high school drama can do a better job or at least do a good job. The actors should think that this will be their big chance to work in a film, certainly not. Along with the terrible representation, the stories were boring and predictable most of the time. The person on the remote control had no meaning. For a bad reason, he had the best hypothesis in the group. <br /> <br /> I'm all supporting low-budget films and giving new filmmakers a good chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and insulting the viewer. I've only seen it because of some good reviews posted here. They must have been planted by people who have links with the film. People may be fooled by this, but you can not fool them into admiring what they see. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2 instead of 1 because the boxer's story at least tried to be warm. She certainly failed miserably, but she tried. I book again for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Make yourself an interest and skip this. I wish I had.
