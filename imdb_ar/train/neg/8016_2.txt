First of all, this slow motion film is icy, and I can see most viewers lose their patience completely in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film was a subject that I think will form an excellent film. The most that we lack here was a conspiracy that would present the basic themes. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer such as Lanford Wilson, I believe that symbolism like the mountain lion invades the school campus can take dramatic proportions without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I think, with good text supporting the film, the filmmaker himself, with the same tastes, and even with the same actors (who did not even get a chance to impress me), they might have been able to provide a meaningful and moving picture of pain and conflict Which the boy goes through when he develops a strong "crush" on an older boy he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I regret to say this without this foundation, armed with a vague, boring, and largely uninterested text, without any plot in sight, lacking any kind of reasonable structure (eg, after Watch it, I think you'll find that you can not point to the climatic scenes, and instead you'll find yourself listing "well, maybe that scene, or the one that was peaking ...") - the result is 95 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> Without a good conspiracy, we will never care about any of the characters; their trials and difficulties are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, the dramatic devices and surrealistic guidance freedoms become confusing and confusing rather than improvements to the story line. I did not really believe, for example, to create "Lea" and I think most viewers will be completely perplexed by the traditional way in which their phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> While the movie stands, I'm afraid I can not recommend it at all. What I can never understand is the reason why a movie like this was not made by an adventurous filmmaker ... instead of reproducing medium films that were good in the first version! All you need is a good script, written by a good book, and I think this film can easily be turned into an unforgettable classic story about the aspect of the appearance of men who are rarely dealt with in drama. All the elements that were very boring and that seemed volatile in the film (messages written on the boy's belly and scenes of "Leah" and fantasies on TV) could become rich if supported by good stories. <br /> I see in a few comments that people are talking about this film on it somehow about the "gay" theme, I think this is a mistake. It is clear that the "crush" shown is the image of a modern boy on an older adolescent boy, but the character of Logan is too small to settle on any particular sex options. In fact, in his fantasies about masturbation, we see all kinds of stimuli, both sexual and We expected a very young boy like him. I think "dowries" like Logan are common among young males who grow up to get a specific preference for female sex partners.
