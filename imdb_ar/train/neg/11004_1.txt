It is truly impressive. The director / writer / actor must be attractive in reality. I can not think of any other way of passing the text phase. What I want you to think about is this ... While watching movies I feel sorry for the actors. I felt like you were in a comedy club to stand where the man died on his feet and sat sitting there, not enjoying him, but feeling really bad for him. I really like to know what the budget is, I think it should be low because the film quality is really poor. I want to write "jokes did not appeal to me." But the reality is that they like you, you must be the man who wrote them. Or delay. Imagine it in script format ... and this guy got a green lighting that's impressive is not it?
