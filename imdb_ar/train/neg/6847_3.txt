This was one film I always wanted to watch when it was released. The posters were eye-catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the movie is not good <br /> <br /> It has a lot of flaws <br /> <br /> The start is good and everything is walking on But the film falls when the romantic track begins between Govinda and Charisma and the songs that follow. Then, the attraction about Govinda and Taboo's love leaves more doubts and flaws, and then how does Govinda become a rich criminal from a poor villager? <br /> <br /> Last again in the flashback and the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra Disappointed Music is fine, highlights Bahot Khoobsurat <br /> < > Govinda tries to play a negative role and does it well, although he sometimes beats it. Charisma is good, but it sometimes irritates with its screams. TPU is fine. Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between high shouting and comfort in acting. Y
