I agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. He rented it, believing it would be a good film since the movie "Mira" and "Olivier". I was surprised by their performance, which was more predictable because they were good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start but it got worse. So I laughed at some bad stunts! When the film is supposed to be ambiguous. You can even guess who the killer is in advance! <br /> <br /> For what happened ?? <br /> <br /> Sorry to say but do not bother until you waste time and money. <br /> <br /> boring !!!
