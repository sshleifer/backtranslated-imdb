Although not as bad as it was made (I've seen much worse), this movie is still very lame. Basically rewriting the film "Coogan's Bluff" from Siegel, the main difference is that the Clint Eastwood hat enjoys more charisma than Joe Don Becker, an unattractive actor if there is one. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is great (and very enjoyable) as a bad guy, a kind of budget Vittorio Jassman. It is the main reason to sit through this steamy potency, as the rest of the actors do terrible acts mostly, especially the girl. Poor Rusano Brazzi Poor, it's hard to believe that he was one day romantic (saw "Cane Mundo" to see him running away from women). It seems here like a second class butcher son, he did not give anything to do. All this is a show without Joe, unfortunately. All this has been recorded in the music of "Action Movies", which did not exceed eighty years and can not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Graydon Clark can make good B-Movies movies ("without warning"), but here he travels, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, the sites of Malta were at least nice, and there Venantini to try to save the day. 10/03.
