I watched this movie for a project about love. Please tell Nicholas Cage to figure out how his personality will be, then re-read the lines he says. My life can not go on ... I cut my hand by mistake ... my brother was soon. Obviously his fault. Since when did the happy ends include the gentle man who takes care of my sad and lonely mother. There is no close or bad script and it does not have enough extension for lowercase letters. Save yourself, unless you have a good laugh. The costumes were suitably fit and the extras performed wonderfully. I'm sure it was good to make a fun film, but keep it more specific, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual film. It's not a chick flick. It's not a strict romance. I can not show children about sex and the questions to follow. All in all, not just a good flick.
