This was a terrible film! I gave it 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and the other for the beautiful Porsche at first ... unlike that story that was easily absorbed only and the cars were not moving across new cities in 1970. Happyend was probably what was more annoying than ever, I rarely saw anything Constructed!
