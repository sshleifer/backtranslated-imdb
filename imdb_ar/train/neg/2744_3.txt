I felt bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie. I could not stop laughing. Everything was very ridiculous. The way children behaved like they were older than 11 years shocked me. One of the children had a gang, which supposedly killed people after 3 years or so. This gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act like everything like this big problem, as if Billy (the main character) does not eat worms and then the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (except for the fact that this 5 year old person says "penis", but not for young people or adults who do not want to waste their time.
