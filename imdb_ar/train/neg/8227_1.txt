I will keep this fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a football match decided to take a "shortcut" that leads them to an abandoned, forest-filled road. Of course nothing but good things happen to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> Well, they did not. They are quickly pursued by a dysfunctional chick with severe mental problems, and the result is 90 minutes of extreme boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope I do not see any of these actors in any film again. Their voices gave them a scream and a scream, and the text was so badly written that it contained many repetitive phrases and hysterical hysterical screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
