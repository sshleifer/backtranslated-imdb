I can not believe I saw this I expect more. It starts out OK. This film drives the limits of reality to the limit !! At least the first one was fairly realistic. The first film is torn and the Joshua project is remembered. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. She has one good message in it though watching for his big brother !!! The film makes it look as if Big Brother is bigger than reality. That was very stressful. Even make-up on the actors was absolutely bad. Some representation is very good. Some representation is really bad. The script was OK at some points and was completely corrupted in other parts. This movie plays on comfort every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I saw him expecting more. I think I'm going back to earth
