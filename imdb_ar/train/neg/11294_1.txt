Well, I've been a big black fan for a long time and I was upset after watching this movie. Let's mention the problems ... First, this film contains a lot of the same crew that I had the first two. PREQUEL has also been called to the original black stallion. Why can not they get the name of the correct Shit√°n Dam or its color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was the mother of Black ChestNUT, and in this film a name is a gray knight Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? He was appointed in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I may be wrong, but the first mistake was in the 1940s when the ship crashed. The timeline does not seem quite right for me. Also, as a gibberish, there is Freesia at the beginning of the film that is supposed to be Shitan's father ... After another notice, it seems artificial. Ben Ishaq is the only person who has stayed to make this film seem to be associated with the previous two people in any way. It may be a nice family film for some but it is the biggest disappointment of my film this year.
