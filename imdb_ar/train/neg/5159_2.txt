It's like watching a dinner that contains only meringue. It looks cool initially but in the end does not offer any satisfaction - nothing. <br /> <br /> The plot is a chaotic mess about a factory of games and evil forces. So, how can this film through this basic plot and Robin Williams continue to show the film badly?! The reason for this is that the picture shows all without any content at all - such as the terrible Bob image Williams made at the beginning of his career in the film. The movie should cost a fortune, but maybe there was not enough money to hire a book they graduated from junior high school. <br /> <br /> The movie is an unusual joke that goes on and on. I'm really not sure why I made it in the first place - certainly not offered to provide any kind of entertainment.
