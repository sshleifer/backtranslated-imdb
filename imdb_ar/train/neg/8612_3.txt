This was a famous film, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's previous films. However, it was worth the time to watch. I gave this 5 out of 10. So, basically, one of those movies that do not go out of your way to see it, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
