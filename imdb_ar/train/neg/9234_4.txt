Set this day, this dark comedy movie will be very disturbing and very disturbing. The chase, obsession, and a network of lies and manipulation are given the luster of 1948 from unkind damage. Drake plays the role of stalker, a shameless user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, playing Grant the victim stalking, angry and stupid alternately. <br /> <br /> Very annoying; I have not been able to look at classic romance with the same suspension of disbelief ever since. <br /> <br />
