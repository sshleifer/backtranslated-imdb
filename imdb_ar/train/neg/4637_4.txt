Bangfield Police are supposed to be the first sign in Keystone Kops, named after the studio where they worked. However, in this model, do not wear silly police uniforms or drive a fast car that represents their brand. Anyway, Maple Normand is a farmer girl here begged her dad to calf. Later you see some strange men in the barn and call the police quickly. One answers and chasing on. After that, Mabel slammed her door just as someone would come. Turns out that her mother is jumping up to be concluded thieves! So while Maple clogged her door with furniture, the mother and father tried to fight! This was probably the most wonderful part of the short along with some police car explosions. These were 7 short minutes passed quickly before they started. The only real character that has been developed is Mabel, who exudes charm through her large face and eyes and looks very cheerful here except, of course, when she is afraid. It's easy to see why you became a star. This is largely because I was recommended to see this at least once and why I give this number 4.
