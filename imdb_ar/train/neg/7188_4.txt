When I took a look at the title, I thought we would get another bitter hard thigh, but I actually found that "5eveny 5ive" was moderately acceptable, and about 80 seconds of recoil after a slow and strenuous average section. The momentum for the half-hour final culminates in a heinous climax and a terminal end. You will not win the awards of authenticity, because it is as systematic as you can and steal its thunder in the way of excitement (the usual cheap jumping fear), location (secluded palace) and the motivation of other films. The brilliant trend is through the book and the material that has completely penetrated with the red herring is poorly understood in its sketchy outline. Sometimes it's laughable, but I was mainly enjoying the brutal and heinous violence he has committed against some university students who are pretty much alarmed by a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of brave young actors, but the characters they portrayed were not particularly attractive. Rutger Hauer always looks good in a short supporting role as a terrifying informant. Made brilliantly, but add shallow and forget to fold.
