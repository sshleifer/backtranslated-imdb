I saw this film in my film class. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I came with an open mind, and I was a bit excited. I really enjoyed Ed Norton, Ivan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the actors were interesting. I just do not ever relate to this movie. The acting was great, and cinematography was interesting, but the film's story, or rather its absence, was a problem. There was no central theme connecting the film. Was it a love story between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it Western? Kind of, but not. I'm all about the twists in movies, I have recently seen "Brick" and loved her, but the place where this film went was too far away. It was very strange, and if I was not required to sit in the whole film, I would go out. The writing was not awful, but it was everywhere. At the time this movie ended, I was confused by my confusion and wish it had ended sooner. There was something about this film that did not resonate, and I understand more anomalous films like "Fight Club", but I did not care about the characters at all.
