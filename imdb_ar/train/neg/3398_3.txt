The aim of the film seems to be to show the aggressive character (like the Mafia) of the Russians, or at least those Russians who can travel outside their big country; it is very easy to steal a bank in England; the British police are so ineffective that they can not find the person The bank was stolen even when these people left the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and her supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language that has not yet been identified anywhere, and may have been spoken by foreigners in the Ural Mountains, but so far are Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and be busy learning Russian grammar and pronunciation.
