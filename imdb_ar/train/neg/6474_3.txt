This was the first supplement I saw (apart from Jaafar's return) and I honestly thought before watching it be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story story was, in essence, the first scenario with a few additional characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who was not happy with life on Earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when Melody finds out she is angry and angry. Then decided to run away, and become a mermaid. So she was happy to swim, and Ariel began to find her - like a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not look too bad written, but the clich√©s and the repetitions of the positions of the first film are only very clear. Adding the fact that Melody, in general, is very annoying, the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There is also a whole host of other new characters - Tip and Dash as two. They're not too bad in characters - just try not to think of Timon or Bomba! The songs are left too much to be desired, they do not have the magical energy that the songs enjoyed. It is clear that the animation did not include a full load of the work in which it was placed, either in the passing parts, and much of the imagination is not used for character movements. <br /> <br /> Another tip - try to forget the original Ariel character while watching this movie. "The rebellious and curious teenage girl grew up to be a nice wife and a boring mother, her red hair tied in. You can see this better if you've never seen the original - you will not have anything comparable to it. <br /> <br /> With That is, in all, it could have been worse - not as bad as it is certain of another complement, like Cinderella II, but it is not in the same league as the original But for your group, if there is nothing else, , Will lose all the fans of the oldest.
