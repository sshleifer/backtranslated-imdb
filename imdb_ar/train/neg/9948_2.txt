Ice-T plays the role of Mason as an African-American homeless man who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F.Murray Abraham, William William McNamara and John C. McGinley) This funny and slow-paced actor who takes time to develop procedures then fails them completely.
