When reading my assessment of the house he screamed, many may assume that I am 14 years old and I think SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case, since I am 30 years old and have been watching horror movies all my life. But I'm an 80-year-old boy who grew up in horror / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. So it's usually better to shoot horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, photography or in this case, the film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this kind of film ... I just do not ... <br /> <br /> <br /> The house he screamed is a boring and very boring film about a school for girls who are involved. The cruel school mistress rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in a row. She has a young son who sneaks around the girls and chats while bathing (in the nightgowns at least?). At the same time, the girls disappear from school because they are the victim of a murderer who is in his place. As far as the campus is concerned ... <br /> <br /> I can see why the house, which mostly screamed with Swisperia (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion ...), compares in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between girls and their parents - This film is so boring and so serene that I hardly wake up. I'm all for "tension" and "suspense" in horror movies - but this movie was not mine. Fortunately, I did not expect much to go to this one, so I can not say I was really disappointed - the house that I screamed reinforced the fact that I personally do not usually enjoy most horror movies much more than 70. This is not a solid and fast rule, Those that I enjoy are certainly more of an exception. It's probably a "must see" for horror enthusiasts who enjoy horror films that are more scornful - but since I do not know many fans of this kind of material, I can not really recommend this ... 4/10
