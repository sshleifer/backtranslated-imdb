Social commentary was largely exaggerated, and the mystery itself was constructed and solved through a series of improbable coincidences that were completely implausible. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last decade making it interesting remotely. <br /> <br /> So I have a problem understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia compared to his puzzle-solving opportunities in England. Can not he hint at the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial plot point to involve in the investigation of the crime. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were extremely melodramatic, unreasonable, sometimes contiguous with strangeness, and this captures this jacket rather than returning to focus on one series. Sad.
