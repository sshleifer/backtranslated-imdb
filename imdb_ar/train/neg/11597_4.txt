I will try with the Alice plot, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, find the deadly dreams of Freddie Kruger starting again. This time, the funny killer attacks the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddie is his dead mother, but can Alice free her soul in time to save her son? This film started really well. I saw Alice dreaming that Amanda Kruger would be trapped in the room and raped by 100 Manics. She was taken to the hospital but she was no longer the pregnant woman, but she gave birth to Freddy again. . <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only people coming back from the fourth movie, and then they got some new friends. It was not long before Freddie started killing again. I loved the first dead well, not as good as others Of deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> It seems that Freddy himself was not scary in this film at all, the nightmare was really boring was not scary or scary at all. <br /> <br /> Acting in movies was acceptable for a fifth film in the series, but overall I think the film was too expensive. (Still the movie is not worse than serial, Freddie Dade is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
