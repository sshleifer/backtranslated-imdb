The plot seemed as if it was a promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire film. After about an hour of film I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it ends? The answer was clearly not! It was not the fact that the human body could not perform a transplant of a different kind without rejecting it. Nor the assumption that secret government authorities had chased him for a human / wolf transplant. The reason was that the film was badly written, acting was lacking in emotion and I did not understand many dream sequences with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a dog pack and left them at the front of the zoo gate, the phrase "If you can not run with the big dogs do not leave the balcony", kept in my mind bored. Save yourself time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that you dare watch it You'll sit there decently as I did and I wonder why anyone is wasting money, time, energy and effort to make this outrageous outrage for American cinema.
