The most important condition for any film that follows the troublemaker is that they must, at least at least, pull on us, as well as their wet marks, the police, the mob and (ideally) each other. But this film does not draw this. Every scam can be seen a mile away (especially biggen!) As it is not very exciting, complex or complex. Perhaps Mamit hoped to make up for this with rapid dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, it has failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in a simplistic, unnatural and sophisticated way so I thought there might have been a smart point about our work all the time ... but it was not. As for psychological complexity, the main character is somewhat suppressed and leads to some Fridays, which forced her to ridicule her father as a whore, but she overcame them. I really liked the street scenes though. It is quite like the Edward Hopper painting.
