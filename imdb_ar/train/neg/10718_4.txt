Come on Tina Fei you can do better than this. As soon as the film began I knew how it would end. It was definitely funny at times. So laugh out loud funny. But there is not enough laughter to save this film. I do not recommend buying this. At most I would recommend renting it but that's it. Baby Mama has some funny but predictable scenes and her failure to end the enthusiasm she is striving for. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fei and Amy Boullahr have done well in this area and have done a good job in this area. But this is no better. Baby Mama was cast a big support. Dane Cook and Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the greatness of the actors. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie of pregnancy campaigns on the world of cinema. After the great Knocked Up and Juno game, Baby Mama looks very mediocre when compared. Knocked Up and Juno Farhanan, intimate and endings make you smile on your face. Baby Mama's end was not strange and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy this year and does not try to be. I highly recommend it but do not expect to be completely hilarious. Expecting a medium comedy does not give the big emotional end you are trying to get. I give baby mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
