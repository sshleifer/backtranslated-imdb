You all know the story of "Hamlet". I am doing. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "To Be Or Not To Be" (not the same speech) has been overcome on Earth so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact, it was not fantastic to start with). In fact, I find Hamlet a good play but pretty much overpriced. She is not the best Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo and Juliet" are ten times better, with the "summer night dream" and "Othello" not far behind. "Macbeth (hit your table, off his drawer, Imp will make adjustments, ah!)" Is not that bad either. There are many others better than that by Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not comment too much on the film, but will dissect the absolutely horrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Well. . . Mike and the bots win a game of paper, get the movie. . . They ask about "Hamlet," Pearl sends this, yadda yadda yadda. . . And getting ready for the most boring science fiction episodes of the MST3K at all (admittedly I have not seen any of the CC Ones). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" presents this terrible episode, because it is not really a film, but random scenes, and divided together (I remember Mike's line of "The War of the Future": "Perhaps this is a choice For short films without a plot "), SOL Crew a lot got off a lot of good cracks. The same can not be said here. <br /> <br /> When the movie itself (which is not so bad) is actually better (I mean, as a good movie, not as a camp, like the "Prince of Space") From the MST3K version of it, you know that the display should be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw her was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried and TRITED to be entertained - but I could not. Just cross-line, such as "Hail coach Queen Dilbert!" (And when this is the furthest line in the loop, well, important) - and sometimes I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe I'm even chuckling. The second time I tried to watch it, I did not even laugh at the few jokes I found funny before, and gave up forty minutes ago. <br /> <br /> The movie is not terrible; it's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although dubbing is not the greatest, it is not in itself a reason the film hates. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; three, yes three for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: Why why, MST3K!
