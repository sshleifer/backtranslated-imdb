The plot is not worth discussing even if it refers to corruption, murder, power and other related erotic topics. Interesting characters though sometimes. Not realistic but interesting though. <br /> <br /> Development is as slow as a tea drinking ceremony. Images are not spectacular, but they are good enough to relieve eye strain. Good movie to watch it after dinner before going to bed - nothing too shocking, nothing impressive. The style of the sitcom of films. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. He had to fight the conspiracy of inadequacy and did a very good job. The rest is possible although it is highly predictable. All are famous and best of most TV shows.
