Always enjoy great films that deal with the supernatural and profound thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film closed me away from its production and direction. There is nothing to engage in a deep debate about what this story should tell; all I can say is that it was a waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, Mark Ady and Thomas Garrett, performed superbly in their home country, England, and we saw it in a television series "Still Standing." Heath Ledger, the real dude bad guys we recently saw at Brokeback Mountain, '05, played a great supportive role. Shanein Samaan (Mara Sinclair) did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any religion. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
