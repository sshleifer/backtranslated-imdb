"House of Spirits" is very terrible. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship just like the country that tries to describe the film. Although everyone knows the films may be far from reality, this particular film treats viewers as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as they appear here, and of course the political process is more complex and interesting than that plot in the "home ...". If you can not show that the complexity on the screen is better not to produce a film at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the cinema, without many common places. I felt in some parts that Carmen Miranda may appear inside parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you should not only be careful, but respect the intelligence of your audience.
