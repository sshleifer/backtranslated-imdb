The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, Old Gnostic Clusters, Robert Englund in a Double Role, Sex and Unjustified Nudity, Murder and Chaos ... On Paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors seems as if it should be fun at least, . it's not. It is a piece of land that is less stressful and incoherent that brings little entertainment. There is basically no conspiracy beyond some ambiguous things about the worship of the work of De Sade, who for some inexplicable reason feels the need to seduce and kill the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist. This is largely - I think it is related to the Gnostics, but who knows what the book was thinking. Most of the film is a chaotic mess where the heroine is subjected to many oddity, a series of dreams and dramatic encounters, and overlaps with scenes from Englund during the prison of De Sade imprisoned in the nineteenth century. It seems that the manufacturers were trying something serious, but whatever their pretexts, they were buried in cheese, malpractice, corruption, and headless heads are fake. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund is interesting to watch, as always the leading actress, Zoe Trilling, while she is not very talented, she is attractive at different stages of undressing through the film but watching Night Terrors is a must. At least, I watched the film "When You're a Crimeer Like Me" from the Australian Film Testimonies Guide, which was at the forefront of many VHS tapes from the 1990s.
