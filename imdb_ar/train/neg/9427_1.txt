When I hired "Unhinged", I was expecting Gore film. The fund also claimed that the film had extreme violence scenes from the drama version (I now have serious doubts about the film's release in the theater). After completing the film, she wondered how she could even get a video version. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: A group of three young women on a car trip collide with their car in a tree. These women somehow managed to make their way to the palace, which contains a highly gender-biased woman. Beyond this point, the film consists mainly of useless scenes aimed at making the film long enough to produce it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie bad is acting. Lisa Monsoon, who plays the role of the main character, seems to read her lines from newspaper cards. Others behave badly, but not as bad as you love. Another thing that makes this movie a bad one is camera technology. Many shots are taken by cameras connected to the ceiling. This is very annoying as the movie progresses. Moreover, there is very little tampering, making the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this one. My ratings: 1 of 10
