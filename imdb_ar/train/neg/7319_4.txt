When you reach the scenes that include Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to hold on to a fur game. <br /> <br /> I love Albert Brooks. I saw most of his films, if not all, but it was the first time I saw this film. Modern romance is an interesting subject on the theme of love. There are a few films dealing with the despair of love or overtly like modern romance, although the scenes of the 1999 Chilly Scene of Winter are coming to an end. They both deal mainly with men who are obsessed with psychosocial craziness for their respective women. <br /> <br /> Where Chilly Scenes of Winter is located on the theme of stalking, this film has a more relevant basis than love because both people are already connected and outside the relationship ... and return to it again. <br /> <br /> Because a movie was released in 1981, it's time for styles and like. This is the main reason I like this film. My basic rule when it comes to movies is "if you suck at least it may have some historical significance", you know the time capsule stuff. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the horrific scenes of the Albert Brooks jersey is nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Man is hair. Very hairy. As if wearing a fur collar of black fur. Worse still, it seems like the victim of his hair is burning. It is not a wonderful sight and the viewer with him without a shirt goes on and on. Back in the early 1980s, hairy men were seen as natural and did not shock anything. But in 2009, the sight of such a thing was disgusting. Sorry, Albert! I hope at some point that someone says "Hey, try this scene, but with you wearing a simple shirt, I mean you might scare people." It is very bad and I am sorry for the poor actress who treated the naked body of Albert Brooks on her head. She might have pulled his hair out of her teeth for several days afterward. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie. It would have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long long minutes because that would permanently distort my vision of this film.
