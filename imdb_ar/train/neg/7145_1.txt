Hollywood seems to be distributing money to anyone with a camera and the ability to talk. This movie was bad bad mind. It was a terrible casting, indescribable acting, and the story is full of holes. Script? Who needs script? I was surprised that the film was not as trivial as I thought it would be, yet I got enough footage from T & A to age me throughout. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) telling a story. Because of the bad writing, I thought the brothers in the film were lovers at first. The scenes on the racetrack, along with the lead actress in the film, kept me thinking of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film that Greenhouse designed herself after ... Only the writers thought they were serious.
