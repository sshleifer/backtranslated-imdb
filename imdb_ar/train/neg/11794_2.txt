Original image of science fiction channel. A little misfortune, but not much. The US nuclear-powered submarine Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep in dense ice ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant electric snakes charged. One crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) believes she has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but has not been given a chance for vague reasons. Among the crew are David Keith, Mark Shepard and Shawn Wellen. This movie could have been somewhat better if the snakes / monsters were not too caricatured.
