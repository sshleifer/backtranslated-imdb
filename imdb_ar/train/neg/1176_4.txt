Revolutions always represent opportunities for dramatic films because most revolutions are in fact dramatic events in themselves. Unfortunately, what is lacking in this drama is compensated by the abundance of boredom. One does not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish them as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. The scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a quality cardboard for them. It may be better to do on a bare stage and leave it that way. One can not expect the amazing effects of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but after all, this is a digitally mastered production in 2002. It seems that the characters are entering a scene in order to enter the scene, The number of people entering and leaving the room is lost. In my opinion, this film transforms the French Revolution of the 1890s into the "paper pulp" revolution of the paper-paper world.
