This is an extremely attractive film for a relatively well defined group (not part of it). I went to preview this movie do not know what to expect - in the end I found it disappointing. The history of a dysfunctional Hungarian Jewish family (often explicit) is not a cup of tea. Such an epic must provide its viewers with something more in the end. In the end, such images about the humanitarian situation - this picture does not receive any new light on any of its most important aspects.
