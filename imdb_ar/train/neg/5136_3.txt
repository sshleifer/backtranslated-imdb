It falls within the category of "The Road is very silly in the departments of dialogue and implementation so that it is not taken seriously." While yelling If you know what I did last Friday the XIII or my friend knows they are bad, the scarecrows do not know it. Evil Dead put such a high standard of comic horror on the budget type, that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> There is uncertainty about the lack of experience immediately due to the lack of hints of noise or vibration in the cockpit of the airborne aircraft. The repeated display of a picture of three men screaming only for the arc story, but nothing comes. Although men are clearly scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing this movie is very dangerous because it may produce some smiles. I do not remember whether Joe Bob Briggs did a Scarecrows preview, but I think he will not slip to that low level. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, there are many people who disagree.
