As an enthusiastic fan of Flashman Books for George MacDonald Fraser, I was looking forward to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this movie was first released. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed at the time - so I left her alone for 20 years before I came back to see her again, but she was not better off the second time. Mr. Fraser is a very talented writer, but I am not a fan of the screenplay of his film with Richard Leicester. The "Three Musketeers" has been spoiled by the same for me. For me, the whole movie tone and feel wrong. Flashman's books are funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is a great seriousness in the way in which the adventures of Flashman - after all, is involved in dangerous situations. This is transferred in novels, but is never transferred to the film because of his comic style. It's a huge shame because he could have a great movie if he were more faithful to the style of the book. When I first read that the book was going to be filmed, the article said the film would have been starring Oliver Reid. I rejoiced, because Reid for me was an example of a flashman. How I loved to see him in the role. Malcolm MacDowell is a good actor, but it does not fit into the visual image of Flashman created by the books (looks very scary! Reed was never as excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it was made as a comedy. The only scene in which the real atmosphere of the book is created is the scene in which Flamman de Gaut (Tom Bell) is killed. It is very shameful that production values, costumes, collections, etc. are wonderful, and castings are excellent in general - everyone in the film is well molded by Malcolm McDowell. Richard Leicester's release may have been responsible for the way the film worked, as the latest radio adaptation of Mr. Frazer's "Flash for Freedom" worked well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman justifying justice on the screen.
