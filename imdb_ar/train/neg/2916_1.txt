This is the worst film I have ever seen. The plot and the message are appalling. There are a lot of mistakes in this film which can not be kept up to date. I do not understand how this film can get any nomination, let alone 2. That's why: 1) Sam depicts me as an angry / irrational investigator due to his father's disappointment. Pros: It's fine angry. Cons: When it comes to the scene of interpretation, he can not convey grief / disappointment to his father. The sight of crying was very fake and seemed to swallow tears from the corner of his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect the movie to the title, there were barking sounds or a dog beating while fighting scenes and rape scene, which is irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but that's just stupid! 3) Why did the titles fail to shoot the murderer? What the heck is wrong with this movie. When the murderer began stabbing an officer, he shot him. He's already dead! My jerk? There was a lot of chances to kill the killer, but I do not know why it was not! 4) During the scene where the girl was hit by her feet. In the scene, it was very clear that the foot of the left girls had been hit, so how do you check the next scene as she lends all her weight to her left foot? Is this actress nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are not synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I think this film is trying to raise awareness of the brutality and violence among children in Southeast Asia, so why does this bad guy win and then the cop would join the fight? 7) This film is very violent without a goal. The police beat CI on the pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is generally the worst film. I really feel that the person who wrote this film is a sadistic and patient person. I have never seen a more disgusting film in my whole life. Worst film ever!
