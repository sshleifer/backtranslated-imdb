Well, it seems the video was filmed in the 1980s, I was shocked when I discovered it was released in 2001. Second, the plot was everywhere, right after the bats raised by the story. If there were some brief intro or introduction the story would have been better. I also appreciate the imagination but this movie was too much. It was strange and filmed badly. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and perhaps the translation was difficult to understand. I love the Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for an epic Chinese epic film, I recommend the promise (visually stunning, interesting plot and development of a good character) and not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.
