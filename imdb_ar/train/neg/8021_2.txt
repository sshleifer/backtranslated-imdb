The director seems to be visually separated and full of himself, and has apparently chosen to pursue Fu's depth to expand the plot of 5 minutes to 81 minutes of the snore festival. <br /> <br /> The moments of action in this film are very limited, and the characters do not even feel realistic. How can you feel the investment in the main protagonist who made a very surreal? <br /> <br /> In essence and in my style, all this sounds like a strange dream sequence. Stimulate the camera's work irregularly, shutting down critical and gaps in action, and what happens with crawling the little spider across the screen? Anyone who has thought about it needs to go back to the cinema school. He made no sense, just cheese, and did not even work with the rest of the film in a stylistic way (assuming the film had a style, close contact). What a flipping.
