I appreciate the need to hire unknown people for this kind of horror film, but they should at least hire some suitable actors. The sergeant is particularly guilty of using his monotonous bulldozer for every single line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is no identifiable plot, so most of the writing includes the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other bad languages ​​rather than the appropriate dialogue. <br /> <br /> The "story" consists mostly of gore and death at random, with some interesting "surprises" that occur after about 10 minutes of seeing exactly what will happen. Not only that, but there are many holes in the plot and the mistakes of continuity (why do they go there? He did not have a weapon? He was not dead?), So the whole movie seems to have reduced the number of hours needed to fix it. <br /> <br /> Another film relies simply on blood and calm rather than any real cinematic experience.
