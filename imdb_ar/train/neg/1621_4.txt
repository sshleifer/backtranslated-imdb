"Fox and the Child" is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary "The March of the Penguins." He focuses on a little girl (played by Bertel Noel Bruno beautifully) and her flourishing friendship with the fox. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful moments here; the Badger mocks him, the lynx chasing the fox through a forest full of snow; one scene in particular when the fox is tortured by a group of wolves is very severe and sometimes frightening. However, there is not enough of them altogether. <br /> <br /> A wonderful shot; great cinematic photography. The Champagne type of film is wonderful. It is undoubtedly a very fertile production. <br /> <br /> Kate Winslet, the English version, but there was little dialogue that already existed was called a very bad name. The result is also very thin, or at least liking me; the scenario, while hidden, seems to move from scenario to scenario, eventually leaving me confused. <br /> <br /> While there is a beautiful moral in the heart of the film, somewhat quiet performance of Bruno Noel is very beautiful, the real star is the fox. Those attractive moments that focus only on our furry little friend are enormous. However, again, there is not enough of them. <br /> <br /> - To keep up with the latest events in the movie, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
