painful. Painful is the only word to describe this horrible rendition of Shakespeare's entertaining and entertaining play. I gave it a chance but was very disappointed and could not even finish watching it. To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this amount of a lot of ado, I pity you and your mind bored. You may raise your arguments about young viewers with impunity. Please do not take this disgusting and disgusting excuse for Shakespeare's famous performance. You will have to induce vomiting and you will need a flint close to the TV you choose to watch these craps because involuntary defecation will occur.
