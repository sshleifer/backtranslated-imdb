*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it would be a wonderful story at least. But like most of the original films of the supermarket station I left disappointed. This stupid family ends up driving in this "abandoned" town to take the brakes and find the video camera that shows all these people what they are doing and discover that they all disappear in the end. The family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what they are chasing. They are more gaps than I can calculate and do not explain anything that happens how or what. It ends when the family is hit by a car accident and is hit by a passion, a brain or anything (never explained). The next thing you know in the hope of discovering somehow how all this happened but it ends up leaving you completely confused.
