I'm just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was so bad although it was hilarious. My friend and I hired him on purpose because he looked so bad. The cheesy old horror clicks are always good for some laughter. The plot was startling, and some voices were called, the quality was terrible. But I'm sure the explosion was watching it!
