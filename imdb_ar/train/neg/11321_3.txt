You can not go away when the initial story is not great. The blood hypothesis that cyborg needs is just a trick. <br /> <br /> Scenario blas√©. The actors do not have much to work with. Groups in the desert were organized to cut costs. It is a trademark that if the background is the desert, the film does not have a budget. <br /> <br /> No budget is fine, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work without a dollar. But it seems that this film seems to have been forced to cancel the change together just to buy a sandwich photographer. Again, it can be forgiven if the story is not just sucked. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is the biggest crime ever: it does not end! It simply ends as if it were a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Strange only. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
