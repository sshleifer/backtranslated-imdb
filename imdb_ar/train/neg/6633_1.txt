from where we start? The best way to describe the horror of this movie ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the humorous humor. This is not very funny. Add a group of musicians who impersonate actors - Meat Loaf is terrible and Deborah Harry is worse. It was unfortunate Art Carney, who had to know better than doing this film. <br /> <br /> Then there's the plot. Roadie's goal is to introduce Alice Cooper and meet a girl whose goal in life is to be a groupe for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, just when the film ends, they can not get out of a final scene acceptable more than a scene - well, I will not ruin for you if you really want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some actors that let you know that this will be a "B" movie or maybe even worse. Gailard Sartain someone for me - has a more prominent role. This is a sure sign that the film probably will not be very good. If there is nothing else, the film lives up to the low expectations - it goes beyond being worse than the poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say this. This is a movie that compares all bad movies. And there is nothing worse than Roadie.
