The occasional version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers is shown at a deadly slow pace, after Johnny Rico left his parents, the (not very attractive) girl she craves and joins the Mobile Infantry. Aliens at the show do not resemble the barbarian bugs of the film, rather than being squid-like monsters that release lasers from their mouths. <br /> <br /> While watching this version, I was quite amazed by the fruity range. They were able to make everything. The show is often concerned with the relationships between the recruits, and the painful and long looks they give each other through their battle shield masks, with the arrival of pop music in the 1980s sometimes in the course of the sporadic battles that finally appeared at the end of the episodes. In terms of construction, he owes Top Gun a lot of participation in terms of speed and content (and all that means).
