This early B class in the national category has slapped Gene Tierney on posters and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you hint to her, riding the camel train in Hollywood. Previously, we created George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as people who barely live, but they must rally in the face of the attack. I saw Sanders as a lot of cadres so much fun to see a rare good turn. However, the attraction of Bruce Cabot is pretty mysterious to me - it is a base and indifferent compared, but I always felt that he had just come out, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and teaching sixth grade. Some people admire this way, as did the character of Queen Jane Gypsy. This is a game full of adventures, and as we have been warned by the local invasion of guns, and ready to sabotage and attack the British in their land, there is a final battle of battle in which we lose the main character is good for all. This feature does not require more than your keen interest on Saturday afternoon, a programmer who does anything else that has been better aligned. It was more interesting to identify the supporting actors and the sudden appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. Two or two and a half out of five stars
