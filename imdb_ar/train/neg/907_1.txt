I wrote a review of this movie down more after I bought it on DVD and was very frustrated. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch it again after reading some of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar films in the budget myself (ie no budget, filmed on a digital camera), I stand next to my original comments. This is a student project with no budget (not a particularly good project), released on video / DVD to look like an award-winning film (if you read the cover). So deceiving the public to believe it is not. I want to recover my money under the Transaction Description Act! Complete garbage!
