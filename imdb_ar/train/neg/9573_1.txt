Not quite outside the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uncomfortable mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. The equivalent of this film is reckless and completely incoherent. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there is one, is a complete "scum". So I would not call it weird, more like a "total nonsense". Sure, this movie is disappointing for you, and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time in this matter, and if it does, the stench will remain like corrupt fish ............................ ......... Merck
