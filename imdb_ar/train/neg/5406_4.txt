My first thoughts about this film were of course bad. I was expecting a bad, terrifying film, and it was a bad and silly thing to do. What I got was not really bad. The special effects were very awful, but I found the film itself very interesting, and the script was actually very good and fit. It was not so bad, and I generally enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a very bad film, but it's not as worthless as I thought it would be, and I'm glad to know that this film has impressed me, even when it was not good. Overall, it's a movie you should avoid, but for me it was not as bad as I expected it to be.
