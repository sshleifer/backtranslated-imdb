The book "Lady and the Duke", written by Eric Romer, is based on the English aristocratic magazines that lived during the French Revolution. But it is an affair, with its exotic and painted backgrounds and tone of voice. It is worth mentioning that this picture of the era of horror occurs almost entirely in one step of real work; one sees few ordinary people in this film, and the little chaos, poverty and terror that emanated from the drawing rooms of oppressed aristocratic classes, but corrupt. The result is often tedious, and ultimately incomprehensible about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it is a disappointing film from the acclaimed director.
