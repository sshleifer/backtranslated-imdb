Earlier in the day, she debated why so many people complained of recent films in which she faced a strange statement: "The evolution of character in modern films is hardly as good or as interesting as it used to be." Depending on the film (s) involved, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes general effects and Hollywood junk, such as War Of The Worlds, but in the case of outstanding and uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to recreate " Back to the cinema, it's movies like "Dog Days" that you have to blame. <br /> <br /> I usually have too much tolerance for movies, no matter how expensive or useless they are (look from good and long things like Andrei Rublev and Dogville to those that I consider painful to sit across an alpha dog) Wild Wild West). I closed this film for 45 minutes, which is more than 30 minutes. I was not interested in any of the characters at all, and I found nothing substantial behind a veil of high-level pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the buzz in society, this film falls very easily in being tolerant with itself, vulgar, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Granted, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are many better films about depression, pity (happiness, gomo, children, salo, storytelling, irreversible) that already contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had no more than a sneer in the eighth grade of society, preferring to ignore any real intelligence about how people actually lived, and instead chose to be a boring, terrible and unethical attempt at a "technician" work. This is not a description of the unknown or intelligent observation in the buzz of society, it is just boring and nothing worth attention.
