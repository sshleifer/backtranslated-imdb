Oh, my God ... this is without doubt the most comprehensive film I have ever seen. The representation is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole film is meaningless. Attach this with modest directions, really weird scenes (such as those where the child reaches over the valley and mysteriously falls), and a completely immaculate dialog box ("See!" "Musta Aborted His Pants!"), And you'll get a whole scene to fail. Not to mention the fact that the only thing that Mr. Atlas seems to have defeated is the case of chocolate plates. But that's part of the film's charm. Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends in a laugh. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, because it's too bad!
