When I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, humor does not wake up. But this woman is expected to be B-O-R-I-N-G, which is annoying and worthy of yawning. She also lacks absolutely nothing at all. The dead way you try to connect its lines is just death when it arrives because it is not funny. I saw two parts of her program and I was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my 19-year-old child, saw her promotions at Comedy Central and said she was a "stupid chick." I thought it was a compliment. The person who says "Watch my program or kill my dog" is really reasonable. I know she wants to be a comedian. It just comes across as a deformed condition. I just do not want to see her around my dog.
