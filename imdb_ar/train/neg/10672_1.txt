He had all the cliches of this kind of film and any material. The plot did not go anywhere and at the end of the film I felt like a sucker to watch it. The production was good. However, the script has B-movie quality representation. The casting process was bad because of the presence of good actors mixed with Karmi representatives. Good actors have not stuck to themselves and others have not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum required of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. play caricatures of them in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for reckless entertainment, I still do not recommend this movie.
