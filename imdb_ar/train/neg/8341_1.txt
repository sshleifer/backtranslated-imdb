I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most of the cheese (we face it, 9 out of 10 horror movies these days are cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, horrible writing, completely hollow characters and unbelievable (no Meisner representatives here!) And a total lack of enough individuals I wish I could save 79 minutes of my life just lost. At least the Crock brothers are named appropriately. The only good thing about the whole movie was watching Alicia Silverstone want to get punches in the face. How this ever made for Sundance is quite puzzling to me. Most of the plot was unrealistic at all, even by the standards of bright films. I mean Come! Who will rush to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after the creepy stalker left his doorstep? Lame.
