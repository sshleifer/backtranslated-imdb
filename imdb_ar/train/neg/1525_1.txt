I saw it on the weekend afternoon because there was nothing else at all, it was better to chew my feet and maybe less pain. I urge anyone to watch this just to see how awesome a horrible movie could be, and it was definitely intentional. I stumbled into every useless attempt of humor carried out in such a childish way, which was not understood, and carried out so badly that it was beyond belief. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, I think I exaggerate? Well give it a broadcast and think again. Horrible, absolutely appalling. If this is not a joke, you must remove the director and anyone else responsible and shoot him immediately after being forced to watch this movie again.
