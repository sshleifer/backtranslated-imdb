I do not know what you're breathing, guys, but please stop. This film was a complete trash can. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was loved, pleasant, sweet, loving and very fun to watch. He had that innocence, but at the same time he was strong as well. <br /> <br /> This new baby, Alex? Annoying like all hell! Just a blatant rush in an attempt to reconcile the magic and grace of Kolkin, and failed miserably in it. <br /> <br /> Bad guys, complete crap. Harry and Marf, they were fun on the team screen. They were comedians, they were comic, and Gugwak really wanted to look for more Culkin, which is supposed to do good villain. These guys Joe Bisky and Daniel Stern, are perfectly ideal for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots fighting again, trying to take advantage of the magic of charisma and duo for the first villains. I do not say they were terrible, but they did not forget or even that they were amused. More on the factional side. <br /> <br /> Then we got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Do not forget. Perfect for watching around Christmas and bringing a wonderful Christmas feeling and highlights a lot of emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story, and take care of the characters. Simply, do not forget and close to masterpieces. Part 3? A masterpiece of crap. It was said enough. <br /> <br /> All of them, I do not know why people like this. I think people really do not know what a good movie is anymore. It's a furious follow-up with more unrealistic traps and a new stupid child whom I hope thieves will defeat at least. <br /> <br /> He ran away from the trash. Let's not start with Part 4!
