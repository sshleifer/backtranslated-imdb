Bo Derek in history will not emerge as a great actress. On the other hand, as early as the 1980s, the talent of acting was less and less than required in Hollywood, so Bo could have gone to bigger and better things after battling Billick Edwards' big box office. This is if she does not allow her husband, John Derek, to take over her career. Many Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (this one in particular) directed by John destroyed the momentum that she had and made her butt a lot of prank. In the 1980s, she was supposed to be able to put a certain character in a certain movie and the box office would be gold. John calculated that putting Bo in a movie in which he was naked throughout the run would make people flocking to the theaters after the ten o'clock fuss. Maybe if the film was good. This version of Tarzan must be the worst of all in the many interpretations of the forest master in Boro, a slap in the face of the character book and the legacy of the film. Tarzan is actually thought after the film is primarily a way for Bo's breasts and Richard Harris to have wonderful acting (remember, the couple had worked together at Orca). Chewing his scene helps you stay awake through the whole boredom and yes, the film is completely boring. Nothing really exciting happens and it seems that the few motion scenes have been filmed by someone in ecstasy. Bo's body can not take you so far. Miles O'Keefe, who has played Tarzan at least, will go on a long and enjoyable career for "B" and Richard Harris can stand behind him in his recent acting victories, but Bo and John Derek have never recovered from this failure and future cooperation between the two. We served to show the reason for the death of his guiding career and her acting career in the first place. <br /> <br /> How did Orangutan reach Africa?
