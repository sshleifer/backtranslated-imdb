There is no suspense in this series! When an episode ends, the acting is very poor, the effects are very poor and the scenario so bad that the last thing you think of is how Batman and Robin will save today. No, in fact, the last thing in your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I can not see how it was made at all, not to mention that it was released on DVD! The effects are obviously not up to contemporary Batman films, but even the script is bad. An incoherent mess revolves around some evil professor and a radiator or something like that, I'm not quite sure, because it's very bad to follow him. Watch the 1960s version, or the releases of the nineties, or even Batman begins, just anything on this version!
