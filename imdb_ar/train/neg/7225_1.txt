I sat in this movie and had to say that he could only draw my attention. The movie was a little more likely if I did not have to watch the terrible CGI, for future reference to the industry if you want to use CGI see this so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is a screen shot, but all I saw was a bad film that was not like a photo novel at all. <br /> <br /> In general, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was very impressed by the acting and I thought the casting process was good and that a bit more personal information was nice because it was a little confusing for me at times, but that's not surprising As I said, I have only kept my attention, but in all honesty I wish I had given this one a miss.
