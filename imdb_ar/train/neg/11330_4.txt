"Giant" is one of Hollywood's most long-standing contraindications. Many scenes look completely fake and without energy. Hadar Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean in this great production in Hollywood. There is a central idea about this film, that a farmer that will resist drilling for oil at home, is a ridiculous idea, and I know that because I am from Houston. Some scenes, especially Din Taylor's coffee, reclaim this boring film. For a more accurate and interesting presentation on how to change the modernity of a Texas farmer, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great shows) or "The Last Picture Show."
