This really does not do justice to the blues. It starts badly with pictures from the Voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) And telling us the life stories of the various blues musicians. As is the case, this may be the most interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing to see is that the actors speak incompetently with the classic melodies, which were filmed in fake black and white, intersecting with the likes of Beck and Simicja Copeland, who then rap the songs themselves. This is a good device to show us why the great old blues were really wonderful, but they do not make watching attractive. There is nothing here that could justify making it a film, not a radio show. No one should be forced to see the re-enactment of these poorly implemented acts. It is a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
