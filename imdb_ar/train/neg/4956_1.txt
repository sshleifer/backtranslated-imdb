When this cartoon was first broadcasted I felt that I was at least halfway, the boy was wrong. I must admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney since those last years. I watched some episodes and two of them Batman got his kick from the left and right by the penguin who fought like Jet Li and hit the crap from Batman and saw another episode where Batman got his kick back by Joker, who seemed to be using Jackie Chan to move while flipping Air like a ninja. How long has Joker or Penguin ever been to Batman? Worse still when their counterparts Joker and Penguin Kung Fu of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It is really embarrassing, frustrating and sad to portray Batman in this show. Awesome animation and terrible dialogue box. Being a Batman fan since my childhood, I can strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this offer at all costs, because it does not show the true picture of Batman. This cartoon looks like wannabe Kung Fu Flick, and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I highly recommend Batman to the cartoon series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
