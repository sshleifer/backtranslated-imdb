This life-long film takes the absolute middle-aged victim that is finally fighting the genre into new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. <br /> <br /> Here, the former 40-year-old wife who was staying at home for a successful ex-wife (her daughter outside college) begins a new life after her divorce, with the help of a college friend opening a new clothing store as a sort of concession expansion. I even started out with her attractive friend, perhaps a little smaller, landscaper / gardener (black). But then, horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, ie 20 something else I took as a tenant to let her out of the room, begin to "grab" her life. <br /> <br /> What the threat of this new young woman really does is a moderate flirt with the gardener, offering him a glass of wine that * truly absolute moments !! It runs water and electricity bills by not rejecting thermostat! The toilet supports! The old food left bad went into the fridge! And hangs pieces of art (African) in the living room !! And so forth. Well, you might have killed the cat too, yes, well, how bad these things are but this is more than fucking, especially as it turns into a campaign. The fact of the character is that any small part of this will push this mad-crazed woman (why did she rent the room - and horrified by horrors of terror), a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Increasingly have mania to control. We have 40 brave things we must learn to face this evil (and look sexually hot, of course) 20 thing. But there is this problem. Any time it starts twenty things in trouble, use POWER - and flirt or have sex with someone, and evade the consequences. (Well, there is already something to see 20 good things.) It's not just * generally * used in this kind of way altogether.) <br /> <br /> Hypothesis is imposed by a 20-something device that deceives the absolute in formalizing Deal to rent their rooms with a lease written by them. Of course, do not know 40 things about these things, and 20 something got help. The lease gives young women the right to be equal in the entire house during the rental period, with the introduction of fixed-rate facilities. Although the eviction proceedings are still pending soon, the 20 are soon getting a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly threatening the twentieth. As you know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe that intrigues me. Finally, the "heroic" battle of forty starts for the house. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or cognitive thing in this film is how easy TRO (or protection orders) get to women than to say that they are not supported, although generally only this is easy against men. They are sometimes not justified as they have the incentive to control the house as it is here. In fact, their friends who have moved with their friends can often evict them from their homes or apartments on the basis of lack of evidence at all, but only on unfounded allegations of threats, sometimes even without hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to refute allegations of threats (to prove negative), where the burden of proof is effective on the accused, rather than the accused. (This is one of the only areas of American law where this is true - a great anger at over-educating women, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steam control.) Of course this is unlikely to be the subject of any life-long film in this Life. <br /> <br /> The basic absurd premise of this film is based on the interpretation that the 20th is psychotic and does not deal with its drug. Even so it makes no sense. She is not yet the successful lawyer of the former husband, although she deceives his help (ex-wife's anger) in her quest. It is after the house (technically, to expel the absolute from it during the lease period). This second young woman is after all that remains after divorce, after affairs with 20 other things stole her husband !! (The ex-husband seems to be unassociated and essentially isolated after being tossed - no matter, he's still lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook, attitude and focus are very weak, angry and full without imagination or life force, making it impossible to pay attention to her. Well, I think a core group of Lifetime fans are interested, judging by the average score given by a few contestants. (I kept watching him just because he was so bad and so caricature that he had an appeal in the camp I could not resist seeing how far they had taken.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (If such a thing is possible with this Click). <br /> <br /> Well, here's an idea. The film ends with 20 things saved from prison through the promise to "listen" to 20 male and female co-workers at times, "do everything he says" and "let him take care of her" (meaning that she gets to continue to eat ) - then trick him and go home. There she climbs the stairs with a knife, hunts her demonic enemy 40 times, bathe in candlelight, believing that the younger woman has come out of her life. There is a conflict - and the forty-four sheikhs my mother wins - by sticking 20 things with a needle under the skin filled with antipsychotics that I found. Then start stroking it, like my mother, and the two women enjoy a moment of female solidarity !!! How sweet
