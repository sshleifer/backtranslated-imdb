By all the fake people have been done on Miike and his work. I sat through this night a flick. I figured, if half of it was as good as the ringo, as I assumed from the comments, it would be more than worth my time. <br /> <br /> No such luck. <br /> <br /> I am all that to find the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the director. I do not have a Master of Fine Arts at New York University, but I know it a lot: the horror film must have a speed. It should give the viewer more credibility than the film does. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me shake my head. Some scenes near the end were very bad, and I went to the refrigerator and stayed there while Ko Shibasaki watched the camera for seemingly minutes, wide eyes and a mouth. A famous filmmaker made this claim, and I rephrased it. A movie can be produced by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it spin. Ko is not a representative good enough to make this work. She was staring at the mutilated girl in the viewer for more scenes than I wanted to remember. They are not the only ones to represent deer in headlamps; other crew members seem to feel the need to replicate this performance. The script gives them a small space to do a lot of time for a very long time. <br /> <br /> I love Asian cinema. Hong Kong's 30-year-old movies, Korean horror such as "Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some far-fetched Filipino movies with sex and fighting for free, Chakushin Ari you've done without.
