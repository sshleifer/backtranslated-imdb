This is one of those movies that I remember in the box for years before anything happened. I do not think it is terrible, but it is not good either. Alec Baldwin was good, but the plot is that he kind of vibrates at best. The cast is very good at what they did, but again you are as good as the script. Baldwin directs this although I have sworn he did not draw all that, I thought I read somewhere or that a lot of re-shootings were not bad but he definitely has some possibilities there although his work on "30 Rock" is not less Of genius and must keep it busy longer. I just hope that the show will come out elegantly with Seinfeld, but maybe not that long. 9 years ago. So if you want to watch a movie you will not get it much, but you will not really hate this for you. I can not remember the last time a movie was wrapped long after it was released and only on a DVD in it. It was good to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again together because their people were excellent but they did not see the "edge". Now pick up this excellent movie for some real entertainment.
