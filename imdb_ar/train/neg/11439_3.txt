It was clear that this film was designed to attract the audience of Chick Flick, whom I came to through very few and enjoyed more. However, this was a very troublesome attempt by Heather Graham to become Meg Ryan (which has become a hell of a bother in itself). Her representation was exaggerated and she appeared to be overly concerned about her colleagues who relaxed in their roles. Maybe this movie was more than that, since there was a budget suitable for the settings and actors and a decent story line. My wife and I agreed that this was the "mud" in the end, where the film ended with the highest embarrassing embarrassing level! Good luck next time, I hope Ms. Graham sticks to the type of movies you belong to, like From Hell.
