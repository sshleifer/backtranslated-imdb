I never made a movie online, but I felt like moving it to do it after seeing this movie. No one appears at someone's funeral and says to the angry, "My relatives are dead, so why should I care about you?" <br /> <br /> Instead of advertising, there was little, if anything, that could be called "art." As the daughter of deaf parents, I was deeply disturbed by the use of deafness as a means of circumvention. It is likely that any deaf person who feels a vibration of such magnitude has been researched, not ignored. <br /> <br /> "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are a few things that I will keep away: the Holocaust is one; that's another thing I wish the filmmakers were not arrogant (and incompetent).
