I grew up (born in 1965) and I watch Thunderbird and his love. See all my classmates. We played "Thunderbird" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wants to be Alan. Countdown from 5 became a technical form. I took my kids to watch the film hoping to get a glimpse of what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was a snappy theme tune. This can not be compared to the original result of Thunderbirds. Thank God As early as Saturday morning, one television channel is still re-running the Jerry Anderson series and his wife. Jonathan Freaks had to hand over the chair of his directors, and his novel was utterly hopeless. A waste of the film. Out of garbage. The restructuring of the CGI may be acceptable, but with the replacement of the homonite by Homo sapiens subsp, the sane was a serious error in judgment.
