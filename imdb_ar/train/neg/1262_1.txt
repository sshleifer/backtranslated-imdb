This film contains a weak plot, poor characterization and really weak special effects. I wonder why I lost my valuable life by watching it. Contains random characters that add nothing to the story and look like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is run by a big knife key. If this movie is not so bad, it would be laughable, but there is nothing funny about it. The main opponent is one of the only ransom characters, and kills. It is sad when you search for a bad man, because he is the best person to cheer for him. When everything was said and done, it was better to leave it on the floor of the cutting room, or not to finance it at all.
