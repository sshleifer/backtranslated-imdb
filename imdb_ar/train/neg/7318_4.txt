This is a shallow, depressed, na√Øve and often uncommon sight of a highly unlikely relationship between Brooks' mental editor and Harold, his vulgar girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything besides the beautiful appearance at this stage of her career; but also because Brookes's character is neither interesting nor gracious. There are 15 minutes of static and exciting at first, where Brooks, after separating from Harold, stumbles from his apartment in an impossible depression - is unbearable. <br /> <br /> "Joker" You are so beautiful, "There is not enough material here to get a feature film." Nothing happens on the sidelines of their relationship to give the impression that these people are in a real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to highlight the hot white light on the issue, and in some way, dismantle it; but if you do, writing and acting should be much better than what is here.
