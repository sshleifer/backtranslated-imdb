What a sad scene these television fanatics are making, the clockwork may be running out on their profession stumbling around a small rust-boat. The entire production feels cheap and heirloom, and the "big name" star, barely able to spit out the few lines it has reliably provided, does not help. <br /> <br /> Support casts the height above the material; they are clearly watching the hour here. Enjoy the sights, get your check, go home, and try to forget everything about it. <br /> <br /> They are not badly written or photographed; there are no real difficulties, they are just eccentric, and they are captured in a very limited number of narrow groups with a small set of additions. The speed is a bit odd. Do not start an embarrassing initial romantic sub-plot until after you start the main procedure, making it feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scores a few points for being efficiently registered, and because it is a fun game to "spot the parts a bit kiwi"; most of the crew are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this film may be a great break.
