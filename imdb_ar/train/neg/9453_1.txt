Holy Cow, what piece of this film. I did not understand how these directors could take a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I think they did not know either! I do not remember anything that bothers me or wanders around the book, does it? <br /> <br /> They have taken this at all classic times for the kids, they have added some jitters, burping and sexual inuindo, and they used it in Kaka's joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers are thinking. I have to say, it was visually pleasing, but the wonderful visual story is ruined by the humor in the bathroom (if you think this kind of stuff is funny) I do not want children who know they think it is. <br /> <br /> Do not take your children to see, nor rent a DVD. I hope the ghost of Doctor Suess comes and haunts the people who made this film.
