The most terrible listing of a great chain. Battlestar Galactica should not be named, because it is only the same in name alone. Many changes only contain changes. You have characters that have turned from male to female, from black to Asian to cologne in a way "to attract the masses of women", when there were already powerful characters that could be stronger. The Egyptian feeling is over. Gone are the search for land. The lack of ways to go to Terminator refuses to stay away from the film, especially when one makes Vembot. Granted the original offer had a lot of cheese, but it had a great following. They tried to stick to the following, but did not give the fans anything to work with and spat at them mainly because they made it "their story". The changes are good, when you make something better, not just make it.
