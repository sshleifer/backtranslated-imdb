A fashion designer travels over cats and is in a pool, hitting her head on something that pops up. With cheesy effects (this was a television film) that floated out of her body. She floats through a tunnel of smoky orange smoke, and solid black figures in her view (she looks like the mannequins in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching a film by Jess Franco ... while her friends revived her, holding her black arm from the wrist, and she had to struggle to get rid of it. When she is revived, she remembers everything, and has a bad bruise on her arm. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, she encounters an out-of-control car that appears on the pavement behind her. At Halloween, she decided with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a holiday. When I got there, I was surprised when I found it was the day of the dead. They feel annoyed by another American tourist who follows them and almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have near-death experiences. They all suffered from the tunnel, but not black or frequent forms near death. One of them has, and he is very worried. I was also encouraged to meet someone myself. <br /> <br /> The doctor tells her about the people he calls "walkers" (the name of the novel on which this is based). They were people who supposedly died of one reason, when he was examined, proved to have died for another reason. So they seem to have continued to roam after death until they die again, but blame poor record keeping. <br /> <br /> I watched this on a 102-minute video and felt a long time. I can not imagine that there is actually a 192 minute version! Maybe if it's supposed to be watched over two nights or more on TV, it's better to see it in this way than one session. <br /> <br /> I have only read one novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if he is the representative of his work, he is not the most original book. Flutter had a common plot: picked up a child who killed people in revenge. Even the difference was very common: a child was dying and people were killed after years in revenge behind the grave. In fact, there is a common point with this film, where the child exercises an astral projection, and when drowning floats out of his body as is the case here. I do not know how far the "Walk of the Night" novel goes from the novel "Walkers of the Night." I understand that Howling's films do not look much like his novels. <br /> <br /> It's a completely slow film, special effects and cinematography are really hidden because of the low (supposed) budget and ad hoc shortcomings of the TV. There are many personal actors that can be easily identified. It is also very dated, more early to the mid-1980s than 1989. I found it boring. A much better, low-budget film that covers a similar theme that I do not think is badly dated is Sole Survivor (1983) (arguably an inspiration for the 2000 Final Destination films). Blows of dead night.
