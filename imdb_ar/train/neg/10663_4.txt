The film was illuminated only by some boring scenes between them. But the actresses who gave a very good show of men were laughing. <br /> <br /> But Christina Allen really shook the film. Her voice was very mushy and sexy. The scenes on the bed that included Christa should have been shortened, but they made it look more attractive and attractive than anyone could do. Is really one of the best roles in these roles. She is also a quiet centaur as well as Paddy in the last 5 minutes, an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds was not very good and this was not all he could do as a movement star. He could have chosen a better scenario. I really think he did for the money.
