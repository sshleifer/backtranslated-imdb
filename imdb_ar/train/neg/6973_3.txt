You did not know that this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it hidden in the dusty horror cabinet. The inscription on the box Insect and the illustrations on the back said it was just another horror film that was not important and badly produced. It can certainly be fun, of course, as long as you do not expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you do not get angry from seeing a tremendous amount of cheese make-up effects. Almost every important aspect makes horror film worth watching is below the standard here at "Blue Monkey"! The plot is silly and not very original, the performance is painful to watch and there is a complete lack of suspense. Following the ever-famous trend of Big Mistakes, The Blue Monkey deals with a new and unknown type of insect that eliminates doctors and patients in a remote hospital. Manufacturers can not be more elusive about the actual origin of this huge creature! All we know is that it is not outer space and initially crawled from a tropical plant. Other than this, there is absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect suddenly comes from! As I said, do not get your hopes in an intelligent scenario. The first half of the film is fun enough, with some nice dresses and the introduction of distorted characters (80-year-old blind woman and alcoholic drinks!) But the second half (when the entire hospital is quarantined) is frighteningly boring. It is also close to the end that "Blue Monkey" begins to tear up too much for old (and better) movies. As it approached its climax, it seemed to run out of budget as well, because the lighting was getting too bad and the man in the monster suit was no longer well dressed. "Blue Monkey" is worth a peek in case you are really bored or if you really want to watch a horror movie every 80 years. Movie lovers B may recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space" and "Curtains") in the meaningless little role of Roger, who is in charge of the clinic.
