I love sharks. Mutations. And explosions. In theory, with those standards in mind, Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was supposed to be the best film ever. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a wicked Power Rangers, and has almost the same range of rubber movement. This may be fine if car makers are not as proud of its design as it seems. This means, for a person wearing a large rubber suit in a flick on action / sci-fi / horror that can take advantage of some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, usually shaky and irregular. I guess it's supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera man comes out. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to someone about to eat, and the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person you are about to eat, and now they are only screaming and being disarmed. And so on. <br /> <br /> The fashion is bad, the representation is lousy, the special effects substandard, but the writing is much worse. Things happen so randomly that more people can be eaten, or something explodes. Because let me tell you, the people who made this film certainly entered into more explosions = a better mentality. People shoot at cars and there is a huge explosion. They shoot the helicopters, there is a huge explosion. Drums, rocks and trees, however, they all explode, so much so that the strange shark explodes in the end. <br /> <br /> When speaking, I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone who is thinking of trying to make up a giant shark sex with a woman to make terrible sharks of children is a good idea. That is, unless this person is the crazy world in this film. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the movie is very random (and sometimes boring) to the point that even bad enough is really not enough for the person for a long time. It may be good to use MST3K with your friends, but then, if you come across this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
