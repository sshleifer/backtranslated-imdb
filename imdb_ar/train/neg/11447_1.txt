Probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. The only people who laugh at the theater are the kids. Do not get me wrong, I love silly and stupid films just like in the next festival, but the basic idea, writing and humor were all wonderful. It seems to me that they were going to feel "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it ended with coercion, frustration and strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt very angry because she (and Cisse Spacek) had been involved in this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you, my God, I did not pay for it.
