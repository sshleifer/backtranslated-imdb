Unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for wife transformation (demons! Destroy it to us). Anycase, if this film is not made specifically for television, it should be so, it is a remarkably low budget, written texts, and less than worth, and hits every 70 except the disco. No one is loved and can neglect what happens to anyone in this. Can be largely forgotten except bad and bad offers.
