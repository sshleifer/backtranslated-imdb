The opening scene "explains" why Hurt became immune to the "polluted man". It is very bad that he does not explain anything else: how he got what he / she was / why he was working very quickly. Then we go to Budapest Day. Well, was the opening in the past or the future? The past is, of course, but for a minute it seems likely that the film has moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention, huh? Or perhaps it is done badly. Then there was a lot of confusion about the different jobs he had in related fields, and finally he mentioned how he should have died from his original experience. AHA! So the private and private industry got together to poison one of its senior men to watch the effects? He must be one of the best players, he is a friend with a chemical company, for God's sake. Then there is a substance in itself: Technically poison, but it mutates in the immune "carriers", so we can get what we want; venom, disease, allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, not infectious from one dead victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there is the h a z m a t: they jump into a situation without having any idea what is in store, or how to prepare for it. Did not the producers have enough money to show an appropriate wash after the crew had just left an unknown lethal scene? I kept thinking that Hurt would die from the bad cleaning technique, and it would be clear that the open scene was the closest.
