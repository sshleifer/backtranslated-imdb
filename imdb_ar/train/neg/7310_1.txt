** The spoilers below !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever has a nod for the worst film of the year ... that I've seen. This movie straight GARBAGE! There is a big mistake in the film. You can not help but be surprised at how bad the situation is. This film had a lot of potential to be good, but in the end it did not produce anything. The characters were as stupid as one could be; for the entire film, you ask yourself "Why do you do that?" Or "What is your point of view?" ... This is the extent of illogical and stupid characters. We do not have any background in them, so naturally you do not give rats as a dollar around their fate ... You can just laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - "Slut" (Marcy) For example ... Was she horny because she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no use in it .... as if the directors needed an excuse to give it a virus so sound! Ugh. <br /> <br /> - Will anyone go to the forest and drink water from the tap of the cabin without first looking at it? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert shoot the sick man only from the start? The film had ended this way .... Besides, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to do so? "No, I'll just wait until two of my friends (one of them flashes away from death) finally get out there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly is Paul trying to fish out of the hermitage, just to fall into the polluted tank I do not think there was a worse end to a film ... At first, the children ask the treasurer for the purpose of the gun , He replied: "It's for the Negroes." At the end of the film, three young black men (dressed in large clothes, one of them in Du Do not less) go to the shop. They discovered that the cashier was cleaning them for hunting, and then he started to give them all the pounds and swaps and joked with them as if they were homeowners. <br /> <br /> Well, what was the point? As a black man, of course, I felt insulted by the initial comment, "Negro." It was tasteless, meaningless: My question to the filmmakers: What is the purpose of the end? With black children? Did this force me to forget the initial racial comment he made earlier? To make things easier with black viewers, by making a joke out of it? Well, I did not find that pathetic attempt at funny humor at the very least. The whole movie was a joke .... Trying to Bathic in the filmmaking that should not be given in time of day. Peter Jackson really believes that this film was good? What movie was he looking at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * From **** stars .... If I can give it a lower rating I will. Please, IMDb'ers colleagues, do not waste an hour and a half of your precious life watching the abomination of "film". This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
