I was lied to the terrible lie on the cover, "Cheerful like American Pie", I sat with my girlfriend in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... this is definitely not one. You probably will not laugh once if you are not one of those little minds like Jacas. It is not even a pompous film, which was at least something, since it concerns sex ... <br /> <br /> So what is this? The wrong plot deals with a man who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember "losing" to one) and gang of friends. The rest of the characters (ie the girls) come and go without a credible reason. Come on, there are even the dwarfs (just as simple: "The dwarfs are enjoying hoo" ...) Very TV-like acting (as with video during the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most girls ... <br /> <br /> A bad movie. Amateur, poorly produced, and most of all is not funny. Children and young people will love to see them with friends because of winter and sexual jokes. Otherwise, do not think about renting this movie.
