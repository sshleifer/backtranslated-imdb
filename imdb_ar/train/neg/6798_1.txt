This is the worst film I have ever seen. All participants should feel embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T is pathetic, and the dialogue is extremely terrible, and the hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every actor in this film. The plot steals strongly from the executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is an Oscar material. I was not very disappointed when watching a movie. Air Rage must be burned by placing its ashes in a cellar without seeing the light of day again. Anyone who saw it should wash and wash the smell of the terrible film. The best part of this film probably comes from the end, when the credits rolled. This was the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must abide by law and order, and other people must retire in this film early or commit suicide. Either way, they should never try to be in a movie again.
