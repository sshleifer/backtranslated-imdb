I did not expect much from watching this movie because it was watching people from Parkersburg WV, where I lived, working. This town is boring as well as this movie. There were a few decent scenes in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy sights they made a point to show. This movie may be good if there is an actual representation of it but there was nothing. Unless you are from Parkersburg and interested in seeing what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. The dialog box will put you into sleep mode, and your representation will cry and you will lose Steven Soderbergh some credibility after shooting this way. In the film is predictable with no surprises. What you see is what you get, a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg in West Virginia and the Ohio Pullover without a narrator.
