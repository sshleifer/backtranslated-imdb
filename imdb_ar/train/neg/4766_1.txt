You can say they spent $ 5 in making this. It is a waste of your time ... no, there is nothing good about this film ... I do not know why I kept watching it. A chick is not hot. Terrible representation .. You can do anything and use it better for your time .. Like watching TV playing strange video games .. I feel robbed. Simply steal .. from my time. I have never reviewed a movie before, as it probably will tell you but this movie felt like I needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and look for IMDb before to see if it is fit and given the comments. , There was no action, no hot chicks, no budget- shitttttttttttttttyty acting-screaming bad film. **** The whole movie in the room. ***
