See, I read and read these comments and there is a lot to say, but I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, forget all the things that were bad this movie was produced ... I do not agree with most people here saying it was Hollywood, I mean, what would you expect a real life story? When people wake up and see that you will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... everything is covered and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm not against No 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID have become awkward in this movie for sure ... <br /> <br /> Next, for all who say The film is wonderful and can not see the truth, either you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you know nothing about him at all and love these teenage Hollywood movies. Use your mind and see though clouds ... there is so much you can say when it comes to this subject, I did not say 60% of what I should say because it is a very broad subject but for the first film I can only say that it could have been a bit, Its done much better. But anyway I'm just someone expressing his opinion .... There are no strong feelings ... <br /> <br /> See, I love hip hop and live in it but after watching this movie, everyone has little intelligence can see This is not how someone is supposed to live. With all respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who are making a living like this, they have to flip the other page because you are destroying the youth .... it presents the wrong message to the kids namely: not going to school but living out of the streets, hustle And just grab the paper .... <br /> <br /> Assumed that true hip-hop is about love and intelligence, be smart and all. <br /> Well, I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something, and I'm not saying that this is a very bad film because even if I've been in hip hop for 17 or 18 years, I still do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I've read or how much I support and listen to To their music ... I liked most of you all there. Only the people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this. <br /> <br /> To end, I just want to say to all lovers and fans of Baiji and Topak, these two men were and will be the greatest ever, no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future attempt to be better, learn and love each other, Think good even for those who do not love you, because you are in the end .. not about how to get a lot of money or fame yo, how fast it can reach the top, it's about completing yourself to the maximum and feeding you, your body and your ear ... because you If you do, you will live life to death !! Peace and Love YA ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY and others who have changed in this world !!!!
