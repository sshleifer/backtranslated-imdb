The most ironic thing about this funny film is that if one becomes a saint, he or she and her family and family will live forever. Let us forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and no other saints are important. So, a thousand years ago, Nick Jolie was a sprite to Fred Scrooge did not even hint at! Open up on Nick learn how to make games, then learn how to play unique numbers; Nick gives the baby a sick doll, a unique re-owning doll, along with the family farm! After a few of these other episodes, he turned to a unique present, where he breathed his grudge on in Anonymous Siblings as a losing mate in his sympathy. There, I just wrote a more coherent story of this stupidity! <br /> <br /> This Santa, which is the one "is, is, is, is, is" away from the massive coronary artery, is a nerve wuss burdened by Queen Harpies, a process outside of Mega-Hell directly, Huh?) That just gave Easter his pink eggs. Oh, and his right man is a solid blonde in tights and small shoes. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me to the edge was Slam, which was rated # 1 on the list of hooligans. Should not be a naughty list reserved for the future Hitler and Stalin? Children who are the real embodiment of evil? No, to the fingers of the old sausage, the good boy who criticizes because he is undesirable and unpopular is the seed of a demon! <br /> <br /> Nimrod must be boiled behind Fred Claus in their own maze! Bah!
