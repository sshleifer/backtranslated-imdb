When the film is independent and not classified, such as "Hamilton", I expected the usual to cut off your violence. I know good films do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, visited the website, and even persuaded a few of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to watch this inspiring film with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawson Creek with beloved ringtones. My expectations were very low for this film, but the few expectations that existed for the film were filmed in hell as soon as I saw an hour before we saw the first drop of blood coming out of someone's finger. There were lots of plot holes and a lot left to imagination. I am sorry not to see happy feet. I think there might have been more violence and fatigue in this movie than in the movie Hamilton!
