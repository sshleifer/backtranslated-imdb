A conspiracy not exist, and tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (snipers / famous world-famous shooters who can not even reach their targets a few meters?), Plus what a finale --- a handful of law abusers who vandalize the launch gallery (WTH?), Technical errors (how many bullets can you put in Glock Magazine? 100+? These people fire their weapons without having to reload). The film is so bad that even the great Hollywood actor like Michael Bien (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this junk. <br /> <br /> I do not watch this movie (I realized I wasted some good time for 100 minutes of decent life on this one). Hopefully the director will stop making films or learn more about his next film.
