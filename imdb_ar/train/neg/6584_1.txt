Being the only film I've ever seen in Nordische Filmtage this year in Lubeck, this year's festival will be remembered as the lowest ever. <br /> <br /> This movie, which has been announced as a sensational thrill, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are not the best. But even the best actors will not save the film. Example Plot: After the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was ill, the neighbor's girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other so that blood would not flow from me to sexual life), but unfortunately these were not the only repulsive images being displayed. Everything else was copied by other managers like Lynch, but of course without their understanding. <br /> <br /> So, to sum up the entire movie and save time for the viewers and their money: the man loses his girlfriend, the friendly girlfriend returns to the house, the guy kills the girlfriend and then gets angry, imagines the hot guy, (Or so he thinks), and eventually realizes that he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lies in his apartment all the time .. bad story, bad actors, pictures, make you want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 One fact is that you are well aware of how you can understand the Norwegian language if you learn Swedish - at least one benefit from the evening - and you can not choose 0 points e Na).
