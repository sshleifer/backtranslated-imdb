I do not want to go much further than that, because I can not really justify wasting a lot of time reviewing this film, but I had to give an alternative opinion to help people avoid the film. The animation is unclear and the story alternates between boring / useless to extreme inconvenience. I've completely lost my sense of humor to the public, and yes - ghosts in Shell lovers, this is not a science fiction or anything like that - it's an attempt at a comic comedy, and humor has not yet worked out. It was very important to watch this movie, and it was a terrible way for me to start the film festival, especially given how enthusiastic and open to anything I was. I did not expect a ghost in Shell's sequel, but I was expecting something fun and he simply did not get it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent a keno trip instead.
