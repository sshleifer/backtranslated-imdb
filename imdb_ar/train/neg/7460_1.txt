Corky Romano must be one of the most comic films ever thrown. <br /> <br /> While sometimes armed Chris Kattan, who made a very funny show in the scary "Undercover Brother" film, Corky is very stupid and very unfamiliar - a shame because the premise is a great idea. Unfortunately they ran out of them when they got to page 3 in the script.
