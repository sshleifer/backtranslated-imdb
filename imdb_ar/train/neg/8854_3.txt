Our STARZ had a free weekend and you run the station to see what it was on. This was the second movie hawling: the acting was terrible but the eye candy was fantastic. Siebel Daning and Marcha Brown as the above dessert ring. I used to laugh a lot of the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never want to go to horror movies. If they watch this movie, they know why. I would give up laughing badly. <br /> <br /> Just a few frivolous observations: Reb Brown who played Ben White acted as an American captain in a television film Marsha Brown. Mick Jaggers for the brown sugar Mick had a great taste for women.
