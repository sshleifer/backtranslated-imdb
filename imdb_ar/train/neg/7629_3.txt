I gave this film a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. This is nothing more than an excuse in black and white to bear the hell of the audience, so selfish Bogdanavic (who has performed better with TARGETS) gets "fantastic performances" of tons of pork in his first appearance. A lot of teenage sexual clich√©s come out of this film, such as Doing the Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Doing the Ugly Prostitute (which is filmed in a very embarrassing way and grinds things to a great extent, not that things were actually going anywhere). <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all this sexual nonsense, to me, it was annoying. I was much more serious than entertaining by cleaning my nails from watching this mess.
