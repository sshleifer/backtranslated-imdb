This is one of the best celebrity reality shows ever. We can see the concerts we can see Britney's life, I love the five episodes. I was always amazed by Britney's presentation themes, I think some people are not watching the show at all, how can we talk about a great person. She is really nice and really funny and she loves her fans and we can see how she likes her work. I just do not give 10 because k-fed that real jerk does not seem to like Britney at all. I'm doing a second season of this great show because some people are showing the truth about Britney. Go to Britney's best and never leave our hearts.
