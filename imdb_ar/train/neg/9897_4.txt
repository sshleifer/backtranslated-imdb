I found that this is a good movie to spend your time, but not at any chance for any historical value. Cleopatra 's photo reminded me of cheap soap operas. <br /> <br /> Evolution funny facts ...! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? Please ... Queen of pregnant Egypt (especially these) will not bother yourself to move from one room to another for this reason! Try to make it look holy in the way of God! And the way they tried to justify killing her sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based on nothing but her feelings and her morals. I did it all for only two reasons: power and self-preservation! I was traveling in a family where I had to survive to survive, which I did well. Anything that stood in her way was either killed (her brothers and sisters) or seduced (Caesar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was so strong that he could not be seduced and gay. So, its end was ...
