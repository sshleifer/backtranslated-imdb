The biggest mystery in Veronica Mars is not the one who had to deal with him on the screen. <br /> <br /> Instead, the puzzle is why this disappointment continues in permanent evaluations. This week was marked by the rare presence of Veronica Mars: 146 out of 146 shows in the top 6 shows (soon to be 5). Yes, you read correctly. Veronica Mars has been beaten through each of the WB displays now exhausted and every show on the UPN. I've defeated all the shows on Fox and of course all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now, hip followers will say: but this was a restart. But everything on TV this week was pretty much a reboot! It is a mind bogey of the reason why CW chose the proven disappointment in rating as one of the few programs I have saved from the UPN. <br /> <br /> Obviously something is happening behind the scenes. Invitations are exchanged and influence is influenced. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be too cynical, but what other explanation is there? It is clear that the line "Veronica Mars has potential" has now died after he spent two years to establish himself and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver's influence and influence may be, but frankly, I'm puzzled why anyone chooses to spend their influence on a bad show that is not watched by any audience. <br /> <br /> A great puzzle and first very ominous appearance for the CW.
