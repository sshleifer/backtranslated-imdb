I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the University of Michigan so I know something or something about the film. Crispin Glover is outrageous. It's basically a mental challenge. Not only is Christy Temple anti-Christ (and I admit it is a bit funny) to tell the mentally handicapped to kill each other, but there is a mania about killing the snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his representatives who face mental challenges. The beta and human rights must be everywhere. It is not a "counter culture," Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival.
