The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is a good paced. Did not fall. The best of the following are performances supporting the actor who plays the role of the planned groom Edward, Holland Taylor always, and the actor who plays the role of Taylor's husband. The actor who helps critique the potential Messieng clothing in an early scene brings exhilarating quality that has not yet won. Well, that's about the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is more faithful to expressing disdain for Messing than any scene where he tries to be either practical or supportive. As others have noted, it seems that he has no emotional investment in this project other than finishing it as soon as possible. On the other hand, Messing tries to carry the film and create an illusion with Kim Mulroney. Is enough to do this, but simply is not strong enough to pull all this actress without help. Give it "E" for the voltage and "C +" for completion. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could have helped him in Messing was a great performance in the Irons-esquire game from the actor who plays her former fianc√©, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, degrading, and ruthless. <br /> <br /> If you try to analyze this performance further, it is clear that I will pay more attention than most people concerned. It's harmless enough to spend time if you have nothing else to do, and less hateful (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're better off watching "My Best Friend's Wedding" again.
