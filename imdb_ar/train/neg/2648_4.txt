I just finished reading a book about Anita Los's work and the picture in the TCM magazine of McDonald in her angelic costume looks great (great wings), so I thought I was watching this movie. I had never heard of the film before, so I had no preconceptions about it at all. I thought he had started a nice start with Eddie as a freak and MacDonald as a secretary he did not know existed. The scene in which she was appearing in a ceremony disguised in the clothes of her simple angel with an uncooperative halo and her wings that she would not stay, was very gracious. I was even with the movie when Eddie goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while I just started to collapse for me. Eddie remains "asleep" for the rest of the entire film, so it's a dream. Everything that happens from there does not matter, because he only dreams. The rest of it was largely a less than useless plot. I had to force myself to hold onto it. The last figure, where McDonald moved from music to music in some crazy hallucinations, was just terrifying. <br /> <br /> If Eddie "woke up" soon and the original story continued, or he had married an angel, I thought it would have been more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real personality. <br /> <br /> There were not enough music numbers to describe her as a musician. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number played by McDonald was like nails on a blackboard. Totally wrong for its operative voice. However, Eddie and McDonald are still able to shine, showing real stars.
