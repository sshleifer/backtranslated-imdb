This film was shown as part of the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival 2007. I had no expectation of the film being picked by someone else for me. <br /> <br /> I actually like movies that take a long time to develop, and movies that allow characters to unfold and allow story flow. Sleep is good. But this film was quite slow. <br /> <br /> Credit should go to key representatives. There was a feeling of tension between them as two very different people, really uncomfortable, meeting in a very embarrassing way. There were moments of sadness and sadness where we learned more about her. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and the way it was filmed. It was monochromatic and monochromatic, added to the film's intimacy and enhanced by the oddity of characters. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the end. What was the purpose of everything?
