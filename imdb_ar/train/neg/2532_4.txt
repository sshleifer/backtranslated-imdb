The cult of personality elevated the status of Roger Kurman, Sam Arkov, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. As Kings of the Pigs. Because the people at Crown International were so key, they did not reach the level they deserved. A film like The VAN may now appear as a disposable piece of disposable esoteria, but it was a great success when it was released (not to mention subsequent versions as a double feature with other Crown Views). <br /> <br /> Fan's network was an ideal example of Crown's success strategy in capturing the mood of filmmakers at the time of the film's release. Here, he had sex, drugs, rock and roll, and the fad "Custom Van". As others have noted, ironically, the song "successful" in the film refers to Chevy when the title vehicle is dodge in the film itself. I had a Selectman City where I was at the time I announced that these trucks were "lying on wheels!" Perfect movie line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There are a variety of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low eyebrows (including Danny's part of Danny Devito). In many ways, this is not so different from the old Beach Party movies in the 1960s, but is now spiced with nudity and drugs. It is clear that it has been accomplished with a limited budget and a limited schedule, as the film swings delightfully with a wonderful charm that compensates for some, according to today's standards and certainly, the views of women other than personal computers. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster of Bobby's religion of Sin on Wheels. Yes Toaster! Hey, you must have something hot for those foods! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
