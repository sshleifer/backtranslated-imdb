Pros: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or is this guy always running to win the AB in their movies together?). Some moving scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: The whole first hour (jokes were flat to say the least). Each scene includes Rajpal Yadav. Great stupidity in decision making at AB. Let me get this straight. He thinks that insulting his son's spirit brutally in every possible way (possibly ruining their relationship after reform) is a better way to make Akshay finally take some responsibility and then tell him the truth. WTF? He considers Akshay so soft that he can not bear the fact that his old father will die soon because of cancer, but he believes that insulting will make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see the logic here? Easily the biggest flaw in the film. <br /> <br /> Akshay became a shaky man. LMAO !! We were told that he completed his first year in college every year and had a degree in MBA. But when it comes time to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a smart man. Haha !! How do I actually apply for a regular job in ur field? Or heck, anywhere else where your life is not at risk? This is some incredibly dumb writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this kind of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throat to feel sorry for the AB character, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me of a little cry in KHNH (which I hate). "Please feel sorry for the man with the disease." I felt more like puking than sympathizing with the old man. I could not see the last 20 minutes or so because of him and therefore I had to fast. The whole thing. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Waqt is just as stupid as being called a good movie. Its obvious director, Vipul Shah, targeted these fragile emotional checks and old-timers who did not care much about a really logical story. Give some decent pictures of songs, fancy costumes, lots of scenes filled with glycerin and some astral power, and we'll be lucky in such nonsense.
