A stupid wealthy man wants around 1800 to visit a nearby mental refuge to see how a famous doctor cares about his patients. Despite a hostile response at first, he quickly received a friendly invitation and was toured by a good doctor. As the doctor explains, he speaks, speaks and speaks !!! As he speaks, the slaves run around here and there and do nothing productive. Although there are some actions here and there (and some are very annoying), it's amazing how boring and frightening it all is - lacks life and energy, which is strange for the flick of horror. Even a man who thinks he has chicken and dresses like bitter becomes more tired. The longer this tour lasted, the more disturbing it became to realize that the prisoners had taken over the hospital and tortured police guards. Again, despite this shift, the film is surprisingly restless in many places - especially when it moves very slowly during a strange party or when people walk around the group. Only when the asylum workers in the prison cell, starving, have no real impact on the film. Given this plot, it's hard to imagine that it makes it boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitative movie have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this could have been an interesting and interesting film. <br /> <br /> You know now, and having thought about it, this plot was one of the episodes of the original TV show Star Trek! As you know, the person named "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are the captives of this madman and his crazy followers. <br /> <br /> Last note: The film contains a little nudity here and there and includes a scene of rape, so be careful - it's not for children. In fact, given the importance of the film, it is not for anyone! However, with the version included in "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics," the print is so bad that it is hard to see all of this flesh because the print is too dark.
