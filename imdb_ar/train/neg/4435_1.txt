Gods, I have not seen this awful film for a long time. Probably not since the "New Man" or the various Freddie Prins Jr movies. Yes, this is a terrible awful. Certainly Freddy is inspired by Mira Sorfino, which is a wooden work and empty. The process of screening films was embarrassing (such as the play, and this sense of imprisonment did not work well on the film). The representatives had no idea what they were doing, especially Surfino. Her tone was awful, her sexual attraction did not exist here, so it was painful to see her "seduce" other characters and "fall" for her. And what was it with casual footage of a direct audience in the garden chairs? it has no meaning! I had to turn off the DVD player, and it was planned to finish this movie.
