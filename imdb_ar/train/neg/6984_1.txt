This film was promising: my favorite actor in a historic drama during the War of Independence. She had memories of "Dances With Wolves" for large meadows, Indians, military battles and "Barry Lyndon" for British ambience and candle lights ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is bad: The cuts are after 5 months; after 3 years, romance is so absurd that America is a big country, but the characters still collide with each other. First of all, wait for the end and understand how to kill the story (imagine the same thing in Titanic). <br /> <br /> Sometimes, bad text is saved by a great movie director. Unfortunately repeats, Hudson is a poor one. I've already committed "Greystoke" and I find again the same flaws: no dynamic in the viewer, in editing, in the recording: it's long, boring, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew this movie was a disaster for Pacino's career : Now I understand. Finally, this last film of 2006 is on its way this year for me: a painful film ...
