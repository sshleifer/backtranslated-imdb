The special effects of this film, especially for its time, are laughable and used in an overly assertive way so that you can not deny its terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The term "excessive exaggeration" is redefined by Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Defoff redefine the word "bad". <br /> <br /> *** Vandals *** <br /> <br /> The magic of this can be found in two things: the first is the excellent representation of Carl "Lirch" Struiken as a mysterious psychological courage, who can know Where and when people will die and always stay there. <br /> <br /> The second is the original discovery, obviously the original SF-Western combination, if terrible, but the other discoveries are more original, such as the gunman Zack Stone being able to feel the pain of the people being shot (though That his representation is short here). > <br /> Overal ... You do not see this movie, unless you like it "Carl Struinken" brutal, as any Dutchman should respect himself.
