No story! The plot is hopeless! Photography based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes, and an automatic transmission arm stuck can not be good! I had stopped this car within a minute whether you were in it or in the police car I was constantly watching. I feel sorry for the actors who have had to endure such a weak scenario. The few scenes that were somewhat similar to the work were very exciting and away from the reality you can get. In addition, there were a lot of errors, for example the fugitive hood, which appeared at 100 mph. At first, the windshield was fully folded, as in fact, but then, burst. The car was later in the film noticed with the hood .... <br /> <br /> This movie was not only annoying, stay away from it!
