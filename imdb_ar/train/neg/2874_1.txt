This film begins with a horrendous horror with a mentally constrained and psychologically depressed female. There is full frontal nudity for males, parts of dead animals, dogs licking nipples, and females losing control of their bladder. Each shot in the cool gray color. Effective, but very little. Then we turn to see the young BTK murderer as well as their present and history of crimes. The tension is completely psychological and the viewer of the killer enters the houses of his victims and talking to them lasts for a long time and is creepy. Here we do not see fancy or good pictures, it looks like it was filmed using a home camera. It does not seem awful, but somehow a criminal vision that clings to its victims for some time before killing them is quite unusual. What this film does not have any drama, really. There are some conditional scenes from time to time, but there is no excitement as to finding the killer. There is not much arc to this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real slaughterhouse shots. It's all over the movie and comes over and over again. Sometimes you do not know it will come and you do not have enough time to look away. And I must reject. I am all for low budget horror films, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate issues things that are not done by anyone else, but they should have moved to this movie or edited the animal jar. Stay away from this garbage.
