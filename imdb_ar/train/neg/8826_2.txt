This film (of very low value) is compared to the classic Silent Night Deadly Night, which is classified as Slasher Flick. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (one of them was full of the original recall of more than half of the film). The "evil Christmas" tries to get psychic by presenting the main character as a person who remains mad, (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). Angry by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work can not afford to make the games manufactured with this lack of quality and love. Wearing a Santa costume finally goes into a wave of murder. Strong word too, because only 3 people are killed without real need for special effects. No tension, no suspense, no gore, no cast. One exception: Jeffrey Damon is there. Tom Hanks was best known for playing the classic movie The Green Mile. He still has to kick himself these days to accept the role. He is really the only person who can do it, and his supportive role is better than the main role. (Who is not so bad, but if you're surrounded by a small supportive character, you're not too great). What about that strange ending? (You have to see it and believe it). "Christmas evil" bluntly blunt, nothing happens and art works are just misleading. This is not deserted. Do you want to see a real slanted birthday, check out the biggest time ever: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
