- Bad Things: This film is a real crap. The bad stunts for one thing, they looked fake so I thought this was the Twilight Zone. Past memories are pretty useless. Part of the film that thinks that getting his anger out of the window will make his life better. I want to know the acting director and if it's high because acting, even adults, was awful. Kissing scene in this movie sucked up. Kill this movie book. The book was wonderful. I do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Goodies: I do not know what I can really say. There are some suspicious parts that prevent you from moving, but they were quickly dropped through poor thorny action and acting. <br /> <br /> - My opinion: You do not see.
