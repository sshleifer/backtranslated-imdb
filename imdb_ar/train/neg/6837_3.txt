Usually, I do not like revenge movies .... period. But the dual effect has little more than the premise of your revenge plot. As you can see, DI has movement, precision, exotic languages ​​(ie Hong Kong), awesome gun battles, and enough martial arts to satisfy your desires in an impressive unarmed fight. Like all vengeful clicks, there are the bad guys who want to get rid of a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact does not contain any of the sensational crap that stifles the conspiracy and elitist, racist and toxic social stereotypes that have invaded the "eye for the eye" and "the desire for death 2". <br /> <br /> Plot a transparent double-section effect as Saran wrap. The parents of Chad and Alex were killed by a band of mobs linked to a family friend with financial problems, or at least that's what I remembered. An explanation of why the boys spoke French dialects is a bad interpretation. It was not the water plot that made this film bad, but using vulgar lines and moving from other films (from the deadly weapon to the bride's princess) made it worse. However, the dual effect is still movable. But why are there such strange films as the bad guys (for example, that greedy British man who killed the parents of Chad and Alex and the deadly deadly redhead chick) that you would like to hate through the fibers of your being?
