I decided to watch this film because it was nominated for the Oscars this year. I think many people here really wanted to love this movie, but I ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the film in camera mode "shaky" really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making this film and its nomination for Oscar is: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who make money from war) desperately needs an excuse or justification for war in Iraq By undermining something (somewhat) national. <br /> <br /> Why do these "heroic" efforts by the director and the main character inspire the public with the idea of ​​"war-like warfare"? .. Oh, please, come on! What a bear! <br /> <br /> Watch this for an idea of ​​how low the Academy of Cinema ...
