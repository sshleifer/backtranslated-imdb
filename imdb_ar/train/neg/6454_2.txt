The monster from Enemy Mine somehow entered a small mountain community where he lived. He is being sought by a doctor who has been converted to a civil capacity for his extermination. The killer, who looks like a refugee from a video of Motley Crowe, is on a motorcycle and is trying to save a handful of children who chose to get Big Chill over the weekend. There are head parts and lots of blood in the first place to draw attention away from the lame story like the bad version of Dr. Moreau (and yes, it's worse than those in Val Kilmer).
