This may not be the worst film Peter Sellers ever made (I think the laurel goes to "Prisoner Zenda") but it is certainly the most frustrating film. It seems that the sellers, especially the makeup of Nellyn Smith, have just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, it does not look much better and most of the film (except for those oddly disturbing scenes where the electric current is exposed) is about to collapse under the weight of all that installation. The supporting players seem tired and hungry, and Mr Kaiser's presence is humiliating even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (One bright spot: this will be one of the last times a big Asian movie is portrayed as insulting ... or, in this regard, a non-Asian star turns into one!). The film looks amazingly cheap, with soup and bad crews painted - so that the unique FIS number at the end looks like a low price. Only the amazing Helen Mirren and the long, thin, nervous man who is wetting his pants add the spark of life to this sad issue. All in all, this film offers a strange display of great comic death, and even more surprising documents about his death.
