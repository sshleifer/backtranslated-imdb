I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and as a St Stahl fan, I had to hire it. Honestly, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were quite a few twists and turns, but somehow somehow guessed them almost before they came. And the film went very far in the end in my opinion ... If you have to suffer by watching it you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Nick was performing Stahl great (especially considering what he was doing). Eddie Kay Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of characters ... a lot of Paul Finch from the movie "American Pie" which came to my preference. <br /> <br /> Finally, the worst part of this film must be Jan Jones' emotional performance ... I think the really beautiful face is all that counts in Hollywood.
