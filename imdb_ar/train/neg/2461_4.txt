There may be more people afraid of the dentist than the little monsters or dolls that look scary. Making it the perfect theme for a horror film, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Ken Winston (Corbin Brensen) has been a successful dentist for years now, but when his wife grabs him with a game of poolguy he settles up, infuriating him and frustrating him. Well, give a crazy dentist a workout and a mouth, and you can probably guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> As I said, a great idea but not delivered properly. In particular, the end is huge. Another note: Mark Rufalo (you count on me, Sunshine ...) watched this picture. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
