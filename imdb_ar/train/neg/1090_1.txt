This was the most useless film I ever saw because there was no conspiracy and actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film has no plot at all, I laughed a lot and my ribs began to hurt. The thing in which older men when Robert Duvall was caught was ridiculous. At the output level, the making of noir does not involve much of the rain sequence and the useless approach to the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a nuier excitement and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. Since this was based on John Grisham's "The Manuscript", I do not consider this one of his film filming because he does not present any thrill and gravity story as films like "The Company" or "The Rain Maker."
