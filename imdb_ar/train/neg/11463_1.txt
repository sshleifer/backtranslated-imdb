This is only a response to Yahoo who says that this film is more realistic than the classic type known as MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, great eggs (and other species of sharks, ox, black rim, oceanic white edge, leopard) are known to share areas where prey is easy. Humans do not often enter into that list, but the shark is repeatedly given in the film as it shows abnormal behavior. It is not as if it never happened. The prospect of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, drawing a human enemy, drowning dozens of thick fishing boats in the North Atlantic and knowing when some of the above-mentioned friends of "enemies" are close to water. To reach, very slim to be funny. Much like this knock-off faeces off. laughable. It is also known that large white sharks chew boats frequently, underwater cages and people on rafts and skis, because they look like seals from the bottom. A Bruce-sized shark (if you do not know it, look for it) will be more than capable of sinking a boat like Orca (hey, that's the name of the rattlesnake we're discussing!), And it will weigh more than 6000 pounds. I can continue, but I do not need to. The amazing Jaws (best acting, best effects, best music, best writing), orca are crap (blatant rip-off of jaws, poor writing, abhorrent effects, silly plot on this side of the flick Olson Twins). It does not require a master's degree from Columbia University to see it. Watch the best movies.
