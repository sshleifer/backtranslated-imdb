"Igor and the Lunatics" is a completely incompetent attempt for amateurs to the horror-mad-hippie-cult murder movie. Twenty years later, it seems, Charles Manson was still an inspiration to the hard-working and incompetent junk film makers. This is a typical production of Troma, in other words, there are a lot of boring and completely inappropriate fillings to accompany the illogical plot. There is a bit of random gore and unwarranted nudity on the screen? This is not bad? But all that is useless and so ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. "Igor and Lunatics" is so desperate that it even uses a lot of footage twice, such as a circle that has witnessed murder for example. The incoherent conspiracy is trying to tell the story of the Hippie cult run by drug addict and Charlie Manson and Winnie-Paul. One of Paul's lesser students, Igor, becomes obsessed with Bible stories and drug addicts and gradually causes the entire worship to turn into criminal madness. Just to illustrate through a small example exactly how crazy Igor is: it ripped the heart straight out of the closet of a very sexy black girl! There is an annoying blending soundtrack and some really fake lame camera technical tricks, such as slow motion shots and mysterious dream sequences. There may be one sequence that is considered more or less qualified for garbage collectors when a poor girl is cut into two halves with a sickle. For no specific reason, the camera carries the code shot in the blood-stained stomach for 15 whole seconds.
