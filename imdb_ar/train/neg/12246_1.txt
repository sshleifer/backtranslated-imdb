*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If someone reviews the film based on the hypothesis alone, one might think you are looking at an animal-directed horror attack. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers headed to an island to film a documentary about shark surfing or blood browsing. (I live in South Africa where it was released as "Blood Surf.") It is recognized that this seems to have a rather interesting idea behind it, which if explored more, can improve the film to some extent. This is not the case, however, because the film's blood circulation is very small, given the fact that the documentary has been boycotted by saltwater crocodiles. <br /> <br /> The script is very terrible. A good example is that whenever someone eats because of the crocodile that happens frequently in this film, no one seems to have made a curse. Most anyone did in the film was just roasting the victim in a scene that was supposed to be influential but ended up being funny because of the fact that the dialogue in this film was highly questionable. Another thing that really angers this film is the fact that they present completely unnecessary characters for the film itself. They offer a group of pirates who can not be seen except that they add another 10 minutes to a graceful short film. <br /> <br /> The representation can be average. Perhaps it was more impressive if they did not have such a terrible scenario to work from. All in all there is not one person who has had a terrible effect on me. Everyone seemed to be a diminutive cartoon, and in this way, none of these actors had any kind of influence on me. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile itself is huge, it is more than 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is clearly seen through the clear crocodile he gave us in the film. The crocodile's death at the end of the film is counterfeit and so ironic that it turns into a stomach. With a huge cry from Bravado, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that turns out to be falling on the hill and you get the crocodile to thrust himself high up the hillside mentioned. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would like to say that this film is the film that must be seen for you to believe how bad it is. What seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible scenario and a huge sense of low budget, all of which produced a really bad film.
