My personal task has been to pursue those responsible for this film. So I got the leasing company to return my money because I argued that they had made false declarations. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the film itself is a photographer, but the art of coverage is what sold me. I've made better makeup effects on my kids at Halloween than what the film really does for cover art. Could you say "Raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I will not waste much of my time by going into full details, but come on, the main character in the film is a cop from LA born and raised in Alabama - but a German accent !? It is more than insulting.
