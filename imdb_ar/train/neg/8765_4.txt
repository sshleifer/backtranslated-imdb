I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. A quick summary of this film is to be avoided. JB Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did not perform any of these functions well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's 1999 attempt to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region of India. Based on the reality, you are supposed to have gotten a hint from this film of the difficulty faced by the Indian army in recovering the area from the Pakistani troops occupying the highlands. But instead of listing what should be a heroic and attractive story, all this film does is make the Indian army seem laughable and stupid, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with almost an entirely Indian audience, was very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but found himself laughing too in scenes that were not supposed to be funny. Gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knew nothing about how the army was doing and that he used the bad war films for reference. The result is a text without minds and repetition. <br /> <br /> Most directors are not excellent, but given the text they gave, I find it hard to criticize them very much. For the support team, all I can say is that I hope they are amateur. <br /> <br /> The adjustment was also bad. It was very difficult to follow what was going on in a lot of time, and the music would suddenly end when the scene changed. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: The cinema was good, although it was slightly affected by the fact that the film did not seem to have been corrected in color (often the color balance varies greatly within the viewer). Also, the few songs that were in the movie were very enjoyable - in the first half of a dozen or so at least. Unfortunately, they have gone too long. <br /> <br /> What is the worst crime ever? This chaos is four hours long. There is enough here that the good editor can almost film a good 1.5 to 2 hours from filmed. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this film.
