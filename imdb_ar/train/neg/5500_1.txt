This film tries hard, but it lacks the fun of the TV series in the 1960s, and I'm sure people remember with affection. Although I'm 17 years old, I've watched some soap operas on YouTube for a long time and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film does not do justice to the serial much. <br /> <br /> Special effects are below the required level, and this does not help with the flat-panel operation. The script was also boring and lacked any sense of wonder and humor. Other films with substandard scripts are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas, Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> I will now say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was executed badly and ran out of power very early, and frankly I'm not sure why, this is something that family enjoys. I was disturbed by the talk, despite the lively voice of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But what angered me more than this film is that it missed the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels made some good performances before, but he had no idea what he was supposed to do, and the personality of Elizabeth Hurley unfortunately appeared to be useless. Daryl Hannah is a beautiful actress and generally ignored, and she likes to be interested in love, but unfortunately you see few of them (not to mention that the monster attack is likely to frighten children more than their fascination) similarly with Wallace Shawn as a kind of operative government. Christopher Lloyd himself is better, and as an actor I love Lloyd a lot (he was in two of my favorite movies, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I'm fond of Back To The Future), but he did not get much to work with, and I had a tendency to exaggerate excessively. <br /> <br /> In general, as much as I like to like this film, I was left without admiration. Instead of being fun, she appeared meaningless, and that's a shame because she had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but lost with mis-implementation. Bethany Cox
