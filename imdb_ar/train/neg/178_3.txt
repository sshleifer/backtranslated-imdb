This film was dedicated to television, so with that in mind, I would not interfere with it as strongly as if I were a feature film. The subtext, but succeeds in being humorous in the sites, whether it means to be or not. Representation is mostly more than others, but this is true for many low-budget films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated is that 90-95% of it was filmed on the film, but in random places, there will be 5 to 10 seconds where footage is filmed on video. You can tell that there is less contrast, colors are less clear, and the shots are clearly 30 frames per second rather than 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if it's necessary to shoot these scenes later and at the time they did not have the money to shoot it (I suppose that's why, anyway), but it's confusing and makes the film look more wonderful anyway, I certainly saw worse films, but I certainly would not say I enjoyed this film and I can not recommend it.
