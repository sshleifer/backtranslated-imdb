You've just registered to make this comment (which has already taken a lot of feedback here). Representation is worse than subprime. It exposes common stereotypes, contains some of the worst manifestations of a tasteless female arousal (everything is not brain-filled), and has some of the most lucrative lines known to man. <br /> <br /> Including but not limited to "lets you see what these guys can do." I should also mention that when they show collisions involving innocent civilians, a bad feeling for innocent people and a start to hate the characters themselves. The character of Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotyped black men who provide people the wrong way. It may or may not be well represented but this film does not allow this kind of exploring characters. Want a film that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This film makes you hate the bad guys instead of catching the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can not compensate for this movie. That Enzo destroyed by Griffin summarizes this film perfectly. It sucks only.
