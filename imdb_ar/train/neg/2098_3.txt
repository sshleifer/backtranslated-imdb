I was hoping to get some kind of in-depth background about the Apollo 11 mission and what I got. Some of the corresponding interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission was linked to dramatic sounds that predict disaster in the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you can dispense with the sound and change the program turns to a positive testimonial on how people can overcome the setbacks to achieve a normal goal, it was great - but I feel like I spend about 45 minutes of my life watching a program of 60 minutes. I want those minutes.
