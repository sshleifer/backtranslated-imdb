Do you know when to look at your collection of old movies recorded on video, and realize that there are some of the movies you saw only once or twice, and you can not remember whether it is worth the time it takes to see it? Alibi was / was one of those films. I found that, not long ago, I decided to give him a chance. I'm not quite sure if I'm happy with my decision ... On the one hand, the film is really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free bar ... Yes, you can get it. The plot is predictable and in no way original. Bad speed. The acting is bad, but that's not really surprising, since the two previous soap opera stars ... are used to over-performance. Characters are badly written. So that the film manages the easiest way to curse to impress me (through the film): court scenes. Even those who do not stir one emotion with or against any of the thin cardboard characters. The movie does not have any real benefits to recover the value at all ... even the dialog box is bad. The thing is, it's full of clichés that make you laugh. This is the only thing that raised this higher than the 1/10 rating: Comic (though not unintentionally) satisfaction for many clichés and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the film, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something I laughed about. Final note: I have thought of using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as a single line summary, but I think everyone knows it, so I chose the current line, considering it more useful. All in all, a very bad movie, but not the worst if you do not have something else to do, if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 10/03
