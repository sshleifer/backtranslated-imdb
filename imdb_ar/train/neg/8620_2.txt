I was not sure if Andy Sidares could repeat his success with the movie Malibu Express. With Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious film director and not just a director. The conspiracy by Sedares, which the Academy has mercilessly endorsed, is a complex scenario with many invisible transitions and twists. The main characters are the work of a sex-based radio station known as KSXY. Smartly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill", they face their long enemy Ken, who is trying to steal one of the most valuable diamonds in Russia. The script is not a well-written scenario, where excellent acting by the team helps ensure this film as a classic cult book. By critics and box office, this film will be appreciated in the coming years. It now suffers from the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but in the future it will undoubtedly be recognized. I'm disappointed that the critic circles did not recognize the Andy Cedaris film industry. Fashion, special effects, all help to complement this wonderful piece of filmmaking. It might be better for you to ignore the bleak evaluation of this movie and go out and rent it yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the popular Runaway Bride, and better or equal to the Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
