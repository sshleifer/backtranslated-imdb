An emotional drama in Denmark in 1969, entitled "We Shall Defeat", offers an interesting Danish show of American culture. Frites (Janus Desing Rathke), a 13-year-old, flowery maniac, comes out with half his ear suspended from the office of the profane professor Lindum Svindens. Lindom Svindens, a school principal, was portrayed as a fascist tyrant who controlled the local community. Linden-Svinden went too far this time, and with his father, recovering from mental breakdowns (certainly, there was not enough drama already ..), and the overly overbearing Hippie teacher Mr. Svalley ("Hello, Call Me Freddy"), For justice. <br /> <br /> I tell you what. It is largely unconvincing, and it behaves in an exaggerated and miserable manner, to the extent that these excuses - filled with vulgar words - as a "family" failed miserably to convince the non-Scandinavian masses. Sorry, your kind Danish readers, this kind of clash in your emotional journeys. But it is certainly not a story about "a boy becoming a man by fighting the regime." A child never becomes a man, but a na√Øve, big-eyed face. If you call a church of young people with small minds, led by a dictator like the cartoon character of the regime, I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you are in a family photo, go to see Happy Feet instead ..
