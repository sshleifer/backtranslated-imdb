Well, I would like to be honest with all the fans that I bought because of the sex scenes in Kira, but unfortunately I have not seen many of them. All the sex scenes were short and performed in a random way along with all the exotic background music and full like all the other B movies - it's not much like having two sexes. There is a little conspiracy in the end - the new Kira lover is a killer. Stop !!! How shocking! Why not nominate this Oscar film? I can not imagine how bad the film would look if it was classified as R (Mine was imported from the UK and ranked 18). conclusion? Put it on the ground and then go away, so Yun will not end up being a fool like me. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
