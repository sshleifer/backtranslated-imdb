My first exposure was Templarios & not good. I was excited to find this title among the offers from Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other classic habits such as "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can not hide the fact that the film is boring. There is an exciting opening sequence where villains avenge the temple horsemen (and put everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, blunt, and, ultimately, inadequate. Add insult to injury: the film was named, not subtitle, as promised by the video jacket.
