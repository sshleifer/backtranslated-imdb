Have you heard that it is said to live every moment as if it were the last time you have? Whether it's your last day or not, I beg you not to waste any part of it watching this! Nichole Hiltz offers some nice moments of eye candy (unfortunately, remains wrapped) and David DeLuise explains why small screen or dog food ads should stick. A shallow, unrealistic plot with a terrible dialogue means that there is no "art" in the art of vengeance. <br /> <br />
