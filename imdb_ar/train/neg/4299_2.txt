This is one of the sex-b awesome B movies that could not be played anywhere near the theater. Women are running dressed in thin "rabbit" clothes, and a very fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes. They all work in a dirty old man's restaurant. He has an eccentric son (Jim Hanks, of course Tom's brother) On "mode". Hanks is actually kind of good, but this movie does not go anywhere and has no meaning. One has to wonder why it was made? However, because of Hank's performance and a few amusing moments (but not more than a few minutes), he has earned a "2" star out of 10. I think I was nice.
