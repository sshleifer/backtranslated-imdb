"Hello everyone, I have an idea. We found this piece in the shape of an egg from outer space, so why not melt it and open it?" "Yes, I know that this will be the dumbest thing the world can do. It can be filled with bacteria or unknown viruses of the earth and can erase the human race, but hey, I want to know what it is." "Nobody tells NASA, they may take it from us." "Wow this thingie gives off positive feedback!" "Yes, already strong on the touch so do not touch it but it is OK to cut it." "Hi there handsome, check out my NIP". (Later that day); "Do not open" !!!!! Uh, we have to run all the way to the lab and ask them not to open it because we do not have phones, radios or internal communication devices, although we have other equipment worth $ gazillion. "I have not seen this organic technology!" "Yes, take this stick and stab it." "I'm getting out of here, I do not care if you kill another 6 billion people on the ground, nobody knows me!" "Look, they are the friendly foreigners from the Abyss!" They want us to come with them. " End
