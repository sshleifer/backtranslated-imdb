In college, a man is killed by a sickle. His girlfriend Pitt (Dory Barton) finds him and tries to commit suicide. It's institutionalized. A year later, she became outside, and she has a new friend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other friends who do not care about a beautiful big apartment in Florida. It is normal for a murderer to appear (without reason) and start killing again. <br /> <br /> The erotic Lousy Slasher - a textbook example of how a horror film does not work with a low budget. For starters, large parts of this film are an endless filler for these six idiots who picture themselves, enjoy "fun" (more fun than the audience), and are immersed, acting stupidly, and so on. I'm not saying that the horror film needs nudity, but anything to provoke this would have helped. Do not show any death (you hear), are only a few bloody and there is no Gore. There is one real wonderful - but this is not until the end. <br /> <br /> With some exceptions, representation is absorbed. Dorothy Barton is as awesome as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is as lousy as Oz. Chad Allen emerges as Brad and he is awesome. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and grateful and gives this crap all he has. Jeff Conway appears in a small role that performs a good job. <br /> <br /> The logic becomes even worse - having realized that a friend has killed two girls talking about sex; Paston's reaction to seeing a friend killed is funny and what happens to Lawrence? His character disappear without any trace in the end! Dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity - skip this.
