You can say that actors will make a film, but this clearly proves that this statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this film lack anything stuck to it. They play the role of cardboard models that are transported in predictable and unhelpful ways. The story is very simple. It can be summed up in a few words, but I will hold back if anyone wants to read this film. <br /> <br /> I had to progress quickly to the parts Jack had made clear to us how to be the hateful eater. I must say that 70% of this film revolves around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I'd rather not spend my time watching Jack chew loudly with an open mouth. Personally, I could have done so without reviewing the shoes and jokes that crystallized the first half of the film as well. <br /> <br /> Outside of my own memento, the film really lacked anything worth its time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that I felt were dragging. When something happens, the characters' responses are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is best not to search for this.
