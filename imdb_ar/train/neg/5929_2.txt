The people who praise this film are the real disappointments - at least I hope Leonard will see some good from this, where he saved his savings by a manager two years ago and is now more than 70 years old. But this film is simply terrible. At first, Leonard himself says he is not emotional about his past, and then in the next hour and a half the film emphasizes the worst emotional elements of Leonard's songs. It is very bloody with the endless closeness of the unemployed singers. Cohen is all interviewed in short video clips, and I wanted to see a medium or long shot of his whole body! I did not care much about the comments of the artists, especially those ego-exaggerating ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this movie did even one good song like Leonard's own music, and if you're thinking about seeing this and you have no doubts at all, listen to them. This PBS will be acceptable special, perhaps, one-time show. But I will hesitate to get a DVD for this. When Leonard's "Song Tower" is finally screened, Bono has been ravaged by a verse. Even the good good performances (Anthony, Rufus's first number, Martha the Trader) spoil through the rest of the angry blabella. Forget this album, and buy Leonard's latest albums if you want to praise him.
