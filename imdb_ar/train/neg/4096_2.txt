This was a classic case of something that should not have been. Gloria was now a single mother, and her husband had left her because she would not live in some communities with him (he was angry that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). At that time there were problems with the serial - come on, I say to myself, is this the same star Michael Stevik who addressed the right-wing philosophy of Archie Bunker? The chain continued, but did not contain any pizza. Whatever momentum Sally Strouthers has gained from All All Family, they have long since gone. Perhaps, if you gave the string another name and were presented as completely independent of All In The Family, you might have succeeded. Well, this is a business show.
