This film does not rely on the Bible. He leaves Christ completely outside the film. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Not to mention talk about it. Do not quote from the Bible. The end times are called the Great Tribulation. The film does not even show bad times. The seven vessels, seven piles, and seven horns of the provisions are boiled up to 15 seconds of sea news to change its structure. The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years in the ordeal, and so the film ended. The only part they got was that there were two prophets. The names were not used there, of course, because that would be very close to the truth of the Bible. The worst thing is that I really wanted to have a good film. I wanted to take people not saved for it. I feel that the film is evil. It is as false as all Satan does. I hope that the next film will not be taken out of the books behind the left. <br /> <br /> The second problem in the film is that it was very bad. Bad behavior, bad special effects, bad plot and poor personal development. I've seen the best episodes of Miami Vice.
