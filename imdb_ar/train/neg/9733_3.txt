Reproducing Firestarter is so bad it looks like a bad TV movie rather than a bad film. How disappointing it is that this comes from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors are experimenting with a human using a hydrogen bomb. The child born to the couple is constantly infected with a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is adults, people begin his life with spontaneous combustion. He tries to know why. <br /> <br /> People who burn completely are doing well, but when they reach the point that they have done well in other words, they have been changed into dolls. When you fire from the arms of characters, they look silly instead of warning you the way they should. It is ironic also to shoot clearly through telephone lines and explode in huge aircraft from the earpiece of the future. How is it supposed to happen, exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing that surprised me about the film is when someone has visions of their late parents. Later we see the same minute shots of those visions in home movies.
