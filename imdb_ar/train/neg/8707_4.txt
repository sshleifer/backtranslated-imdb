This is one of the most extreme films I have ever seen. I hired it as a joke, and I expect to laugh at the first few scenes, and let me say that I have never laughed at this uproar in my life. The first scene in which the ninja comes out randomly from the air and begins a huge and ironic fire battle is one of the most stupid and funny action films in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but a movie that makes fun of (and does not mean at all) the type of movement. I have not seen the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think there is much I missed. If you want to watch a wonderful movie with six packs or any herbal remedy, I insist that you rent this movie and rest and watch 100 years of progress in the cinema scattered in the trash and smashed with Carnosaurus
