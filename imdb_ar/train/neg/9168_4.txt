Randolph Scott leaves the United States for green pastures in British Columbia, Canada. He wants to start a cattle farm with his partner Bill Williams and cook me a tung fu. They liquidated their small flock on a toll bridge erected by Victor Gori. Later Gori stole their cows and Williams lost his left arm during the fights. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of great Westerners under the title, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately, Cariboo Trail will not be included among its best strangers. <br /> <br /> It's like something that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is frankly silly at times. Williams who was along the way with Scott, wanted to go for gold exploration because there was a big hit at the time. He does not blame the thieves, blames Scott to convince him to make the trip to lose his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Lee Tong Fu and Gabi Hayes were captured by the Indians. They are fleeing because Gaby's mule has been taught to kick the leadership and it expels the Indians and allows our heroes to escape. I'm not sure he would have played in Rogers. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the story wants you to believe that Thai explorer Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles in a golden blow after a few lessons from prospector Gabi Hayes. About how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was part of Gabi Hayes's farewell movie. It would have been better if he had come out in a good west and in fact did a better job than Randolph Scott before. <br /> <br /> I will say this, although no Caribou is featured in this film, is one of the few local Canadian films of the past that were not found by any Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Randolph Scott or Gaby Hayes, take the next road off the Caribou trail.
