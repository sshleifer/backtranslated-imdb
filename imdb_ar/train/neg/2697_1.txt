Based on the personal experiences of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, higher education comes. The film focuses on the racist politics that occur in modern day colleges. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters in the film based on his story: Malik Williams, a humble African-African athlete. Male American. Christine Conner, a soft-shielded white girl, and Remy, an unorthodox white man. The three are overcome by surprising facts that college life is not as good as advertised and the three are disappointed that they are not ready (Malik), being naive (Christine) and being undesirable (Remy) The film shows that modern American colleges are just secondary schools. Faculties are not places to build personality, develop potential, or promote personal progress, but institutions are used to gather all kinds of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. It is an experience that is usually built for failure for most students. It would have been good if the film had built a story about this atrocity instead of racist politics. <br /> <br /> But it has not happened and this is where the movies fall apart. Seongleton seems to have been a very bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie, it leaves everything out. There is no need to overcome the bush here. Singleton lets you see heroes and villains in this piece easily. <br /> <br /> Black characters in the film are largely seen as heroes here while all the eggs in the film are seen as bad guys, except for Christine, who was raped by a white student colleague. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the contradictions in this film? Black gang members who come to help a white girl after she has explained to them who are supposed to raped her? The ease with which members of the black gang at the university, while a group of skin heads meet in a dark little dormitory planning violence? <br /> <br /> Omar Ebs (owner) and Christie Swanson (Christine) are disappointing. They seem to be the third choice for the roles they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play the roles of Malik and Christine but were not available). O'Shea Jackson, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were all obsessed with their roles. Lawrence Fishburne was sadly mistaken here as a professor of history. Michael Rapaport is the only one who has achieved great success in this film and considered that his character, one of the three main characters, changed most of the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American college life with this film. He did so very badly. It was like killing a gun fly. Life is more complicated than it seems and people are alike everywhere and you should know this. Higher education is proof that he did not understand this at all. Watching the film, then and now, would confuse the audience itself. Not to mention that he would not think of the lowest.
