Baby problem is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad film about a wild boy adopted by parents, but he faces a problem later that a junior can drive a grandfather's car. People can scare with the bear. He can put a room on fire! It's as bad a movie as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The sequel is the worst fate. He rented the chicken instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
