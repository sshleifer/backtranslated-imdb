Colombo's films have been going down for years and may be down this year. Peter Falk presents the same unflattering performance and comes as a creep in this film. As usual in this series, crime scene protocols have not been heard, so credibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scene and pulls the faces of the pantomime and Andrew Stevens is an unconfirmed lady man. (Although his fainting was a scream!) The script was in numbers and delivered. They were not supposed to enter Colombo in the 1990s, just leaving us with one or two happy memories of smart plots, better texts and sharp descriptions.
