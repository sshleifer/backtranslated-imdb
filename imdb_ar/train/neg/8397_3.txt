After reading the previous comments, I am glad that I was not the only person who left confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Karadin appears twice in a grave and pulls the lid closed behind him. I have waited impatiently for some explanation for this strange behavior ... It is normal to suppose that he had something to do with the evil things in the house, but since he was killed by the first rising body (hereinafter referred to as Zombie # 1), these scenes do not Its meaning at all. Please, if anyone knows why Karadin continues to climb into the graves - let the rest of us in it !! <br /> <br /> Each action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try to get a summary. John Carradine goes out to the cemetery to investigate and is choked by coma No. 1. So far very good. But then, we'll see a confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Streicler, who photographed the moonlight in the cemetery, discovered the body of dead Carden. Strickler tries repeatedly to push Ireland to the open grave in the back of Zombie # 1, but Ireland has succeeded in likening him to the open tomb instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as zombie # 2! Yes, I think we can deduce that Strickler was dead all the time (witch?), But why he never changed the reason why he turned from ordinary appearance to rotten version by flying to Tomb # 1. Zombie, I thought he would prefer to stay in his "natural" form until his work is finished). This scene also offers a question to mind - only who is IS Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims who were shown during the opening credits of the film, but who knows which of them and why he has a certain grudge against the film crew. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after Ireland sees this shift and escapes, we see that a minute shot of Zombie # 2 grappling across the trees as seen in Zombie # 1. (This leads to a temporary confusion about how many zombies there are in Truth). Then in the best horror film of 1950, Ireland managed to travel while fleeing. He knocks his head easily on the tombstone of the dead Peter Domerjo (not so nice to John Carradine to chisel a grave he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> The chaos in the house has been destroyed. He easily sends three members of the film crew, then starts up the stairs. Feith Dumergo hears him, believes that John Ireland lover returns from the night toss, comes out. When she sees only Zombie # 1, she goes out to a bedroom and retrieves the Irish revolver. While star Carol Wells is raining at this stage and can not hear the scream, her star is Charles McCawley (who trembles and puts it in a mirror in his bedroom). Taking his gentle time (and only after more wigs than the hip flask) he finally decided to investigate. (The only thing that draws the attention of the viewer during the last quarter of this film is how slow the stars react to screams and bullets). Domberg returns to the gallery armed and ready, but McCauley mistakes in Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He is playing the nice acrobatic game on the handrails, and then the horrified Domorgy hangs over to the waiting arms of Zombie # 1. <br /> <br /> Carol Wells is now out of her shower and dries when she hears gunshots and the screams of Dumberg. She also does not feel much urgency in running out of the investigation. So during this time, Zombie # 1 has time to climb Domergue from the neck with a rope. Wales sees the dead body of Dumberg and quits death. The next time we see it in the stream outside the house (???) - but more about it later. Meanwhile, Ireland recovered his senses and found him at home where the bloody zombie massacre was discovered. Although Ireland has found three people dead, he is more concerned that his film has been hit and destroyed! Fortunately for him (and the audience), Zombie # 1 puts some film equipment on his head from the second floor. This is the last we see in Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience is treated with a montage of all deaths, which shows that the new "mirror" old. How deep it is. <br /> <br /> At the same time, zombie # 2 approached the house (remember, this zombie moves slowly like a molasses in January) where it happens to see Carol Wells float in the course, her fish out. How did she get there? Did Zombie # 1 bring her down, throw her, and then come back in time to crush John Ireland? It is clear that one of the original victims has drowned in the basin, so Wales must also sink (but the cause is not explained outside in the course, rather than the basin). Zombie # 2 does not enter the house itself (everyone now dies, anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1) but instead returns Carol Wells back to the cemetery. Due to the flashing of the finish on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave. <br /> <br /> The viewer was left wondering: Yes, but was not this Zombie # 1 Tomb? Why does zombie # 2 take a residence? And what if Zombie # 1 and you want to go back to him - will you let him Zombie # 2, or will there be a fight with zombie? Will the zombies share the tomb and the newly deceased Carol Wells? What about John Carden now dead - where will he stay? After all, from the previous scenes, we know that it is clear that in his house in the grave ... If this final scheme of the seal has left you puzzled, do not worry because you are not alone.
