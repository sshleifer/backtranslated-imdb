We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: few people will face the challenge. Friends and family of these and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center may be enthusiastic about this eloquent play turned into a movie. A sweet and sincere firefighter, despite his tongue, remembers what he can of his missing colleagues for an angry journalist turning his fragments into praise. Think about the results. He hides more than that, forming another poem, etc. <br /> <br /> The horrific events that have caused the need for several thousand words of mourning are very sad, but this boring false dramatizing is very boring.
