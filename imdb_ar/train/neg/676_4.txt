I wanted to see it for two reasons. The first, was a remake of the Sierra with Bogart, the second, and the Bogart part by Jack Palance, who can play exciting roles with some ingenuity, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Seira Hig. Here only, the actors do not care, the manager is lost in his ideas, who knows what the product was thinking. Jack Palance is bored by looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters asking herself what she is doing in this film. I do not want to compare it with Ida Lubino in the same role. Of course, they had to use the story of the dogs again! Sure, they have come up with some different ideas. It may make a nice color to see the same location as the High Sierra camera, but that certainly does not add any quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you watch High Sierra before. Otherwise, why do not you see a false film noir. For me, better death than seeing him again ...
