Well, the previews of this film tell you just that a rebellious young girl will live with her grandmother during the summer to straighten up. This actually is not the case! It is a 17-year-old rebellious young woman who reveals secretly and returns to her mother to believe whether she is telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I really enjoyed the concept of this film. They had a really good plot and a really good subject of love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. But I did not enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan. In fact, this movie was great if they had someone else, probably a better actress. Rachel's character (Lohan) is a very aggressive character, and reminds us quite a real Lindsay so she takes a lot of film. <br /> <br /> However, I think that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this movie. The finish is very impressive (and sad).
