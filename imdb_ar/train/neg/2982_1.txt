Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Some movies are actually "too bad they are good", and Zombi 3 is not only bad, it's miserable and unforgettable Ways so that a whole new language may be needed just to describe all of them. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is a film attributed to Lucio Fulci that even according to his standards has no coherence, meaning or cause at all. However, we can not blame Folsi for not really getting him out, but Bruno Matte, who does not even have the sense of elegance to help with the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film, but amazingly amazing. <br /> <br /> So, I'm ashamed to say that I enjoyed every minute worthless in Zombi 3. It does not have recovery features - in a kind known for high-profile characters, a weak story, and a lack of filmmaking skill, Zombi 3 pays The boat is out, but it is so much more entertaining than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The "action" begins when "Death 1" begins. Gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in flight. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military think that creating hordes of cannibals from the dead would be a good idea? All these and other questions will not be answered at Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the crazy thief gets hit by all kinds of green plasticine growing on his face before being tracked by the army who He decided rather foolishly that the best way to get rid of his body is to burn it, and send "Death 1" to the atmosphere which led to ... Zombie Bird! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people! (If zombies are carnivores, why not attack other zombie birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet with "our heroes", three horny GIs and a load of girls. There are some other players with them too, but they are not important - there is no one important here. You will be under intense pressure to remember the face of anyone, not to mention his name or find a reason to care about him. They ended up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("A week ago this place was packed with life, and now it is full of flies!") But the undead is inevitable. <br /> <br /> By this, either you will either be completely absorbed or you will turn off the damn thing. The text is so shocking that even the greatest actors in the world have not been able to save it, so they also have some of the worst - not just human characters, the zombie who acts here is the lowest level ever. There is no consistency in the zombie behavior - some shame at the time of honor, while others are fully engaged in fist fights or wandering with machetes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to speak (a gimmick that gives the film the horror of twisting). They die from gunshots to the chest (instead of the head) and are beaten by a good left hook. How can a zombie punch ??? !!!!! In fact, focusing on the 1980s is very bad and often makes it look like a ring of v ... <br /> <br /> Zombie also spends a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting hours in ridiculous places for the chance of some poor people Sap pass and get fear of their lives. They hide in the bush, in the garages, in the huts, on the roofs, in the water, and even under the pregnant women. At one point, the zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat? No! To her to the water, those zombies and bad humor! <br /> <br /> There is a lot of nonsense. The limbs are broken, the wounds explode green pus, there is a lot in the way of eating meat and people are wandering around in their faces. There's nothing like the original eyeball hole, but if the bad make-up effects are your bag, you will not be let down. <br /> <br /> All this I have not even mentioned the awful music, or the flying zombie's inexplicable head, the world that actually acts to emerge as really bad, or the ultimate final bet line ... in an innovative development On the original radio station that was invaded by the zombie, zombie 3 gives us a DJ zombie !! "They went by their side!" Cry of our hero heroes, before we pledge to continue fighting against the undead in the sequel unfortunately did not come at all. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 is nonsense - there will be no loss to the world if every printed edition is destroyed and its records have been destroyed, but somehow I feel that my life is richer than seeing it. <br /> <br /> Have you said richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
