Incredibly disorganized, rude and ultimately ridiculous ("horses, my God, horses!") Excite. It's sometimes creepy, but it contains one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how everyone in the last ten minutes "magically" exactly what the plot needs until the "decision" occurs. Bland offers by potential clients, the eccentric performance of Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real breakthrough, cutting the viewer by half and making the movie more difficult. 0 out of 4 stars.
