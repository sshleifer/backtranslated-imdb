I am a big fan of Fred McMurray and Carol Lombard. In addition, Charles Butterworth (a very interesting supporting actor) was in this film, so why did not I enjoy it in particular? Well, although cast well, they are one of the poorest written pictures and the most cliche "A" that I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent in producing this film, it is shocking how poor writing was. I knew that the film would be boring when I found out early in the film myself I expected exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! This is not because I am a kind of "savior of films", but because there was no imagination or effort. In fact, it looked as if the film was just a long series of cliches all tangled together! Also, I found it outrageous that Fred mistreated Carroll severely throughout the film, however, and according to the conventions, she eventually fled to him. Uggh! There is more suspense in the film Lassie ("Will the people come to save Timmy or the rope that hangs from the rest?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the anonymous and very tedious script, there were some pros about the movie. It was wonderful to see Fred look like a broken fertile at the end of the film - it was reasonable and he did not seem to eat, shave or sleep in days. Also, "Charles Butterworth" "Battle" did not provide humorous moments to say the least. But all this was not enough to make this film look different from the movie "B". It's a shame, ... it could have been much better.
