Japenese's sense of speed, editing and musical score should be different from American tastes, but certainly this film was a little more than post production. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood needs to re-make this movie and I think it will be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something around the edges of the city, the brave police, earthquakes, sanatoriums, and mysterious water-salt killings that are enough to be captivating. However, this story must be a little reasonable and may be shorter than 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> I must say that the impact of the "sixth sense" was fully applicable in this film, and it was clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As is the case, only Japanese fanatics should watch this boring film.
