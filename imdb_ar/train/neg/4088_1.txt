It was a watershed event in my film to watch life. I went to see this in the theater when he came out. I was quite amazed by how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who raises money and who owes benefit - a very, very great service. Special effects are the first grade level exactly, as was the case in any first grade student. The bat bats on the strings without any attempt to hide the tendons, arrows that seem to be drawn on the film and look like the arrow you find on a street sign, and a funny story line. Ed Wood presented masterpieces compared to "conquest". Every film student must see this thing only so they know the definition of a very bad film.
