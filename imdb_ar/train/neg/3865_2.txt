This is incredibly bad too. Poor actors. You can say that they are trying hard to polish feces, but we all know you can not. The writing is very clear and easy to use, it is sad to see them trying to sell it. The sense of humor and rhythm is very arduous, it is hard to believe any of these good actors who signed this. <br /> <br /> However, it is so horrific that we have difficulty finding the screen. We just have to know where this debris goes. But that's just because we signed up on television. If we have already paid for this, we will be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So you get two stars for being at least amusing / nasty. The occasional music (unlike the very hard independent soundtrack) reminds us of a funny episode of Scooby-Doo ... but it's not good.
