I must say I hated this film. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is there. About half an hour of tedious conversation, sorry to all those who are already interested in the plot, began to reorient quickly to the scenes of Jerry. I really do not know the end, I've been bored by it. If Gerry does not exist, you may have done two things: sleep or stop it, but Gerry is the bright light of this film, as with most of his previous films. If you love Gerry's do not worry, he's adorable and priceless as always, but if you want to watch the movie for the plot, good luck you'll need it, either this coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... This is only because the film director had a sense of Jerry's position in this film, although they had no idea how to spell his name!
