This movie has now become a yardstick to compare all other films with it ... as in "Was it stupid like a pistol?" I was also in the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival last night, where a room full of more than 2,000 people left in a strange silence after I was completely disturbed for two hours of utter nonsense. Jason Stratham was amazing if he had a goal. Within the first 10 minutes, he made a proposal by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano fame) making him feel no sense at all! Then there is shooting and then wearing Ray Liotta embarrassing bikini briefs, then there is some animation, Ray Liott nude butt, a lot of shooting, gnashing of teeth, I want to have an art house excuses and more embarrassing Liotta body that raised laughter in every show .. I'm not quite sure of the reaction I was looking for ... and not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than the ordinary bear and Jay Ritchie thinks it is embodied. The lines of the story may not have gone anywhere, but the situation was out of reach! The only way that this movie could have been worse is Madonna herself.
