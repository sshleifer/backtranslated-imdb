This is the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the rug from under this one, for me. Props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called the "Chepnis". It seems as though the space scenes were built in a power station in the 1950s, just before the demolition. The music really sucks. Representation of wooden and pork. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It becomes rude when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The trend quality begs in belief. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if you try out what should be one of the biggest small budget splits at all. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
