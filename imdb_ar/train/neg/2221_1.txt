I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it has not stopped. The only interesting scene in the entire film is the opening scene where Michael killed his sister, Judith, wearing a Halloween mask. The most surprising moment in the whole film is when his parents tear up the mask to see their son kill their daughter. The film moves from there and does not pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but it is too late, we the public lost our full attention to the story. There is hardly any evolution in character, and people always care about being an exceptional heroine, Lori when there is not much for her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone who is terrified of this film, but if you want a terrible movie, watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the best horror movies ever produced. Halloween is definitely not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave her four stars, because there's no way this film could ever be worth it.
