This film was strange ... I watched him swallow a quarter of a piece of biscuits (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm sure you're supposed to see him up, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing .. Maybe LSD would work. The movie is a collection of things that turn into other things, dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards but when it was released I'm sure it was fine ... one of a kind. I can see how some people thought that this movie was good, but I did not think it was too fun, I was in the mushroom at the time. If you have a party or something and everybodys is lit up to some extent, you can enjoy some laughter.
