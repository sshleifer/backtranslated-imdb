The only way to enjoy this click is to hit your head against the wall, allow some internal brain hemorrhage, allow a bunch of brain cells to die and once your mental retardation is formal, then maybe * MIGHT * will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only saved grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent as a taxi driver as well as a British girl. Maybe if they were to create the entire film on their escape in India, and how they eventually fell in love, they would make it a much more enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> My only reason for rating 3 is that of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were unnecessarily wasted. In addition to the scene in Heathrow from Re-Union was more than just digestion. Being an international traveler in the post-9/11 world, Anil Kapoor had shot a lot before reaching the Sky Bridge to announce his true love :) But once again, the aim of the film was to challenge logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg at the audience * GENERAL *. <br /> <br /> See it at your own risk. At least I know I have been deceived for life :(
