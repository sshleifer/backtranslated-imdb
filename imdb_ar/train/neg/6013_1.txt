I have read every book so far in a series behind the left, and the film almost does not do justice to any of them. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This film would have made a good MST3K ring. The text was a terrible adaptation of the book, and he felt that the actors were reading their lines, rather than actually saying them. The characters were cruel and unacceptable. The effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake. The end was awful. First of all, did not go even during the first book. Second, it had no meaning. If you have not read the book, you will not have any idea what is going on. It had to be the most student-like end, like a student film I saw in a movie. I am annoyed that I have already paid money for this film. If you get a large version of the miracle, you have to fix it completely and let Hollywood control it. These two producers of the wannabe film, the wannabe director must leave the film industry pro.
