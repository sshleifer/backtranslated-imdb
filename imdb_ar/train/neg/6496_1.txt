This film was disappointing. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the kind that starts the film and does not stop it until the end, but I forced myself not to stop it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not turn it off is because I like Cristian Slater's fan and I want to see him act in it. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor in it. If you were not in this movie, I was bored with my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to be committed to acting. At the time the film ended, I did not get this plot. I was confused and upset.
