I have seen bad films before, but this film has been awarded the "Worst Film of Life" by far !! Anthony Hopkins must be totally mentally ill until his name is linked to that name - anywhere! I will not watch another movie with him, take it out, etc, etc.! I can not believe the other actors and actresses I loved, (in this picture), which have descended to the point of being part of this disaster! There must be some wonderful medicine out there! In order not to be embarrassed by anyone being part of such a film, it is beyond me! Save your money on this! Huge flop from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr Hopkins! Also, shame on Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on line for this one!
