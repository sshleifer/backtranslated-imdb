I watched this movie last year in the media category and I must say that I really hated it. I was 10 years old (and I was 15 years old) so it may have something to do with him. But for English this year, year 11, we had read Animal Farm, as well as George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, as I hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I think it was the most disturbing film I have ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most disruptive people ever living on this planet. I'm sorry for everyone I love doing, but unfortunately I did not like. The subjects were well filmed in the film, but the way the film was prepared and the events that took place were not according to my criteria. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure that many other people completely enjoyed this movie.
