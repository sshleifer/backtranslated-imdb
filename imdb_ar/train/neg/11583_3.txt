This film presents a wide range of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them generates any interest or positive response. I waited for the plot to start, hoping things would get better and it ended up bitterly bitter, but there was no reward for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a summary, look elsewhere. For me the work is not worth recounting. Not that the story was bad, I think you can say that I have some problems in the script - for example. I thought it was lightning. Looking at the credits will show you that there is a strong team here, but to no avail. Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs. Of actors that I have not seen much before I particularly admire Deborah Kara Anger. This is all I can find to say well about this picture.
