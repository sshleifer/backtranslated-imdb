The original version of Man On Fire, which has been badly rewritten and often confusing, has been reissued at least 10 years after its release and its years have not been better off. This is the type of film made by producers who have too much money and too little experience to get attention, and everyone else pays for their outstanding expenses or their drug dealer, with Scott Glenn's bodyguard coming out of their limbs to save his 12-year-old character. Year-old daughter of a rich Italian family. A great team - Joe Biscay, Brooke Adams, Danny Aylo, Jonathan Price - all performed well, working slowly and separately, and John Scott's outstanding score (which was part of the last roll of hard) was a positive one. One case where the remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of director for this version) is improved.
