Well, this movie was taken halfway, but but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially this man who is now in the teachers and the book collection, although at least proved to be able to act if he wanted to! (The part where someone has a heart attack that stands out as a bastion of bad films in terms of acting, programming and public credibility) seems quite clear that it represents a profit on human traffic, but while this is not the best film ever, at least original and has Representatives did not like handing them over to the high school students who were still desperate and trying to get a degree of success. Not as much human traffic as much as a car accident!
