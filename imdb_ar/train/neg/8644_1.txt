This is a complete hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was clearly filmed in the state of Rajasthan in northwestern India. Take a look at the hunt scene - Indian cars. Writing everywhere is the Indian language used in India. Drive across the typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. It seems that the directors in their film (on the film) on DVD Bonus seem to be risking their lives in and around Kabul. Almost all of their scenes are filmed in India. The scene where they see a group singing about the fire is so fake that they did not think of changing it to a popular Afghan song. They just recorded Rajasthan's popular song. How do I know that because I traveled to this region on a large scale. They are just on the cart to make a big in the case. I challenge filmmakers to deny it.
