Every now and then I will rent Motion / Adventure just as a way to relax and occupy my mind without anything important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a good movie, but it makes me laugh and let me relax for a while. One day, I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hired this movie because I wanted to be entertaining without being challenged. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something like Zina's badly written episode, and Cathy Long was a very social theater (not bad for professional boxing and amateur actress). There were a few high points by the cyborgs. They somehow managed to get very good actors to play bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die very quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts films, the more you play in the film, the more emphasis there is on work, and the plot (which was not strong at first) deteriorates almost as quickly as acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director spends on her back. At the end of the film I was seriously thinking of seeing him again just to calculate how many times Cathy Long's tight red pants were a central screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was not enough meat for this film to make a satisfying curiosity worth seeing the movie again. If you're an Xena fan who needs something for a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend 0.50 cents on the rent. There are some strong similarities between the presentation and the film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect anything more than just be moderately amused for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you happen to like derri√®re Kathy Long. Then you may want to buy a copy.
