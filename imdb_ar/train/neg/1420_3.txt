[I've seen this movie once late on a public television station, so I do not know whether it's video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) Shirley Temple did in this. Early 1930s. It is hard to believe that anyone would allow their daughter to be in this lively little film which may now be considered this aspect of the "Kiddie Porn". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple stars in a cast probably have an average age of five: all in diapers, and they are in a salon that offers milk instead of alcohol. "Money" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley Dore plays "femme fatale" up to the bar and talks to the soldiers who make suggestive comments (!). But Shirley does not really need lollipops / money because her purse is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> At the same time, a small black boy is dancing at a nearby table (!). What a strange film. . . Infants who use the lively dialogue play adult roles in the salon. Who thought of these things in any way?
