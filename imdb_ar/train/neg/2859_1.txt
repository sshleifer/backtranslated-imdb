It was made in 2007, and the CG is bad for a film that was produced in 1998. In one part of the film, there is a shot to stop a dinosaur that looks really good, but this makes the work very amateurish on things CG looks even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is terrible. This is bad, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, as with other films, the only scary part about this movie is that it has already been created and is now being broadcast on the Sci-Fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still do not understand how in a way I make people who have some acting skills behave in these movies, then make them behave in a horrible way like everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those who are not sure, the other poster is obviously being mocked in his review ... or he is one of the people who worked on this film.
