Not one of Keaton's best efforts, perhaps this was a veiled attempt to avenge the family he married - Talmadges. The Polish / English language handicap and a series of coincidences lead to Buster marrying a large Irish woman who treats her (along with her father and her brothers) in a shameful manner until they think he may be a heir to wealth. The wrong identities are frequent here - the gags are set up but for the main failure to pay. <br /> <br /> This short metro contains at least two real laughs - Buster cleverly turns to his lack of dinner with the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adoptive family to bring the meat to his plate. The other is a family portrait, where the entire group collapses slowly on the ground where the camera tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> Beer yeast may be bypassed by the catalyst for a huge series of cups that have been built on gags, but a short stop (for all accumulation) of development. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is clear and clear and the result is one for piano player, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth some laughter.
