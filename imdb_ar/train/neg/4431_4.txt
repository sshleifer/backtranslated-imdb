This stunning comedy drama got sterling's amazing reviews when it was released in 1979. I remember the opening of the Los Angeles Times film section and a two-page ad on "Chapter Two" full of glittering explanatory comments like "Better than" Hey Girl! "Neil Simon does it again!" What does Neil Simon do? He takes a case of autobiography (remarries shortly after the death of one of the beloved couple) and makes him rusty, unpleasant, and worse than anything else - unusual. James was the role of Neil Eh, a George - writer who can not seem to have returned to life after losing his wife; Enter the passionate Masha Mason (soon to be the former Mrs Simon) who tries to love George despite his temper and general grief.

I liked spree Mason in the end ( "I'm awesome! I am frank about me!"), But I have not seen a happy ending for these two people ... and the time proved to Swabi. ** From the ****
