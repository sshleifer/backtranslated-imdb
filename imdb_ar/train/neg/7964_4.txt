"Creepshow 2" is a little more than a pale imitation of the original, it was designed with a simple purpose other than taking advantage of the name of the previous film. It even amplifies its previous defects, which was often predictable and harsh. However, the first time, there was enough excitement to compensate for periods of periodic calm, resulting in an uneven but overall overall effort. The sequel of a few moments is worthwhile, so the transparency of the stories are clearer. Once every time, it delivers, but most of the time, there is still only. <br /> <br /> As originally, all stories revolve around the theme of common revenge and sweets. Indian wooden comes to life, avenging the killers of its owner. Teenagers devour a water monster. The park returns from the dead to follow a neglected car driver. None of these places are bad in themselves, but they are completely lacking in inspiration. There are a few surprises and no fear. This is an example of a textbook on the making of non-paid films. It does not help that this cheap film suffers from a static guideline, although to be honest, there was not much to do with it. In the end, the second story comes better, but not too much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are fine at best. George Kennedy, as the owner of the disastrous public store, is doing an appropriate, if not particularly inspiring, work. Dorothy Lamor, on the other hand, is quite as good as the guilt-ridden driving lady and empathizes with her plight despite the expected excess material. However, most characters are generally thin. <br /> <br /> One might think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who produced the original, returned to the script, based on more Stephen King stories. Make-up artist Tom Savini turns into some good work. So why is the movie a disappointment? I think Romero does not really want to make a second film, but he was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, cloning, depression and the like, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine that the man writes the script in a hurry, receives his salary and runs away. I think he had to do what was necessary to fund his projects; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (****) <br /> <br /> Released by New World Pictures
