This movie is again, one of those films that someone thinks or tries to make others think they understand. Anyone trying to make any sense of this is a moron! My advice is to take two and not one but hits two very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it! Although in the end you may kill yourself to waste your acid! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something about you that will try to defend the film. Unintelligble. rubbish. Schitzoid. The waste of talent. The movie is a snowman, with a paper on the destination with ringing clouds, on a sunny dive in the candy .... Looks like a lion in a red light with a vision of hair. Now explain it to me!
