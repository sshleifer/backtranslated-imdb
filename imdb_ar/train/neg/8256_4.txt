The only word I can think of to describe this film is: normal. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy plot about Gary Senis's attempt to commit suicide is a silly and delusional hypothesis. He lives like a hermit or a hermit. In a cottage driving golf balls in the ocean because he can not handle life in the professional golf community / pro? I cry on the river. I wish that these were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Becker and Sensi but obviously this movie was a bad choice or a paid check for Sines. The scene in which Timmy Price is subjected to simple verbal abuse by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so high that I am embarrassed to watch it
