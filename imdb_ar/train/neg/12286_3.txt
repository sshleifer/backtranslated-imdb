Make the summary from my cable TV guide more interesting than it really is. "Rock Slaughterhouse" is by far the worst horror film I've ever seen, a title that Urban Urban: Final Cut has already dubbed. From the opening scene, I could say it would be really bad, but I was so bored that I did not care less about it. This film has a laughable representation, especially by the man tormented in his dreams, as unbelievable as the unreliable conspiracies, and some of the craziest music I have ever heard of, and I live in a time when Britney Spears was dominating the air waves. The biggest problem with the Rock Slaughterhouse is that it is not funny. One can be boring and boring and not scary because this will try to broadcast things a bit with some ridiculous lines here and there, but no. A friend of Tormented Guy who concentrates on himself has tried to be funny, but we encountered it rather annoying. (Spoiler) and please, did you tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and hated enough to visit a creepy prison in the middle of the night? no one! If you're going to make a horror movie, you should at least believe it. This one is anything but.
