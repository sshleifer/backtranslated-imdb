I saw this director "Woman on the Beach" and I could not understand what was good and the reviews were fantastic. This film is very much like that person, two people in a relationship with very little dynamism and even less interested in anyone else. Like his other movies, you'll want to listen to a blank dialog, wandering around very little and becoming charming with characters written, not interesting. If you feel like you can love this movie, do not let my evaluation stop you. I love its simplicity in movies, but I feel that Tsai Ming Liang films are very superior. He has a fairly wonderful actor in Lee Kang-Sheng's films. There is nothing here. I wish I loved it, but I do not. Oh, okay.
