At the end of the film, I just asked myself: "Is it the worst film I've ever seen or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?" The answer is ... In fact, having watched this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it, you can not find any sense and you can only remember the two scenes of rape, two useless and useless monsters. It seems to me as if the director tried to push this question to the head of the crowd: "What are these crimes compared to the horrors of war and annihilation?" Because I noticed that the horrific scenes are directly related to the war and its horrors. (During the first scene, here is the girl who is being raped while screaming and at the same time hearing one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start the war with Iraq. In the second scene, the three criminals who hang a sword in a woman's vagina, Followed directly by the World War II photo archive, but as facts, I could not really think of the relative gravity of theses two different kinds of human horror expression, I was deeply shocked by what I saw and felt (sorry for the bad English)
