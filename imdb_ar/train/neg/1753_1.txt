Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings had a profound impact on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly anticipated watching this film and learning more about his life. Words can not express my disappointment. This film was separated ... he gave no background to his life, no historical context, nothing about his great writings (except for a brief short reference to "the cost of apprenticeship" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the United States) and scare his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently to show his humanitarian side. Well, I'm ready for the drama. The part in which he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing it, we get a very bad love story with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether it really happened or not, it should not be a big part of the film. Now ... still waiting for the tragic part, or some narrative that explains what all his writings were about ... or something to let us know a bit about the greatness of this man. Drum roll ..... waiting ..... ..... waiting ..... zip. Nada. This is the kind of film that gives "Christian films" a bad reputation. All they had to do was put the structure of the film to follow, with some background ... even some vocal sums, or memories of his past preaching of his ... some narrative about who he was and where he was. But no ... that's what we got. Hardly suitable for the hero of faith.
