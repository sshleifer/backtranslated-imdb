I chose to see this movie because I got a good score here on IMDb. But many people either have really bad taste or someone was proving the result. <br /> <br /> Either way it was a real disappointment. The movie is completely stupid and far away as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: I felt someone was thinking: "Would not it be great to make a movie where there are snakes on board an airplane and then the snakes for some reason will become crazy and start biting and stuff?" that! The plot is thin and not original. Snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners in a movie no one will recommend to anyone!). The representation is weak, and all people are of the types of stereo that are incredible. <br /> <br /> To summarize: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - Stay Away!
