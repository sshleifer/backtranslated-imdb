I purchased Unhinged because I got the absorbency of expensive photo on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the killings are displayed and I can honestly tell you that they look better in fixed frames than they appear in the movie. <br /> <br /> After saying that, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls who lead to a rock concert (through the dark deep woods in one of the longest driving chains taken on celluloid) slide down the road. There was no visible damage to the car but it seemed enough to put one of the characters in a coma for the rest of the movie (or maybe read the script and were in a coma before starting filming). <br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large isolated house. The house, by the way, is gorgeous and manages more drama through its presence than any actor in the film. For some reason, though, this house has no ways to go. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of the Unhinged sitting around listening to the bizarre conversations between the rich old bitch (who looks like George Washington is in a state of audacity) and her equally cruel sexual daughter. It seems that the girls were not in a hurry to return from this concert anyway they were filling more clothes than cast on Gilligan Island for that three hour tour. <br /> <br /> By the time we arrived, the viewers, to the scenes of murder, we no longer care. We hope that someone will kill us to end our suffering. Unhinged film finally concludes by a very shocking ending worthy of being in a much better film. It seems as though the end, the only good idea in the film, was written first and then the book tried to produce a film that would lead to it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is a boring film in the end with misbehavior, an incompetent output, and a plot with more holes than the leper in a porno movie (sorry. I'm not sure where it came from). You'll get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening credits, when the screen turns black for about two minutes, while the characters talk about something that is not worth remembering. do not waste your time. You will feel that you are single and want to recover your time and money.
