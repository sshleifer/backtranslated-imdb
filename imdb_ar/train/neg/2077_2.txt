You need an excuse to get out of the house while drying the paint - leave the film after an hour to go back and watch the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I do not remember that I ever remember going out for the movie, but I really tried to stay. The script did not reach the cast and kept "going and going" badly - Come on! Uma Thurman do these things? The special effects are somewhat lame. These were the personalities and representatives of the elderly who were taking the lives of 20 superficial horns - just a kind of annoying and wrong feeling. <br /> <br /> This review is only based on the first hour - may improve. I just had to go home and see if the paint had dried a darker shadow when it went on.
