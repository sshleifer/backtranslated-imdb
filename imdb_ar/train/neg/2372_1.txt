Close stupid, unnecessary and humiliating to close "Nightmare on Elm Street" Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talaye deliberately wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into a big bad joke and tasteless. This is not just an entry into the epic "Elm Street"; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever, and it offends fans of this genre! The stupid story, stupid characters' drawings, the entire structure are obscure and ?? The most expensive ?? Similar effects are special and visual effects of Tom and Jerry Cartoon. The sequences in which Freddie Kruger killed his victims are endless and very interesting. Were we supposed to be terrified when Freddy turned him into Brecken Mayer to become a video game character with a pogo around the walls of a house? The story brings us back to Springwood and suddenly Freddy seems to have a middle-aged daughter. Do you think he will remember that in one of his previous adventures, but no ?? There is only one teenage survivor in Springwood, and Kruger uses it to communicate with his long-lost daughter. Another reason for this final installment is the extremely awful structure is totally illogical. John Doe-boy was introduced as a leading personality, but after all he died suddenly and the plot continues to spin on two adults! What about it: Freddie Krueger, who spent five whole movies killing only teenagers, was eventually beaten by two adults wearing three-dimensional glasses! Kind of like the ruins of the whole essence, right? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a frighteningly exaggerated series, but even the weakest, it had even some recovered elements at least. However, "Freddy's Dead" is simply intolerable and no one should waste precious time watching it.
