This movie is by far the worst movie ever. If you have to make a movie that costs the man who plays Lars heavy weights, do not make the film. I must say that I can watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I can watch the video for these POS. Adam Sandler must be restricted from any film after this shame. This movie looks like a mix of listening to Cher and placing your cock in a mixer. Anyone with half the brain cells will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give support to the Lorraina Bobbitt support organization before buying this movie.
