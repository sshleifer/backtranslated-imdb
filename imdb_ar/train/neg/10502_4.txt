The film contains several story lines that follow several different characters. The different storylines do not seem like a whole piece of stuff that makes this comedy very incoherent and disturbing to watch at times. <br /> <br /> The sound may sound weak and vulgar but real; you're better off watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and hilarious than this movie. I'm sure both the crew and the crew enjoyed this film very much, but the film does not give viewers much fun. For comedy, it's simply not funny enough, and Steve and Terry Irwin are not good actors, even when they play themselves! Their instincts simply are not good enough to make a full movie around it and their scenery feels long, distracted, unnecessary and even annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The film had some potential. I mean, Steve Irwin is one strange and funny person to see in a strange way. So when I first heard that they were making a film about a Crocodile Hunter, my first reaction was; But the film suffers heavily from his weak story and uncompromising lines of story with unusual and interesting characters. The movie contains a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie viewable at least once but still, I should not recommend this movie for sure. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time. This film can still be seen only once, when it is shown on television, on a rainy afternoon. She has some good moments but story lines completely destroy the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
