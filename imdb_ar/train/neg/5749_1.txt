This is definitely one of the worst movies ever produced. Every scene is painful. He will moan from the futile attempts at humor and work with the alien camera, racism, racism, funny storyline and wooden representation. Poor Joanne Bennett is the only one in the film that is not embarrassing. In all, appalling.
