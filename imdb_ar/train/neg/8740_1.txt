I and my friends rented this movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in a moment. The film is not supposed to be funny at all, but it is very ridiculous and lacks any realism at all. First, Phillippe (I forgot what I call his character and do not really care) uses his regular employee ID to view all the top security stations. Not only is this pathetic, but he is at the forefront when his enormous efforts culminate in finding the very scary Lego room, which hosts supercomputers. This is plain funny. The tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoiled from the childlike room. The end, like everything else, is very cheese, especially when the lawyer shows the bad guy "on time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to enjoy, you should definitely see it.
