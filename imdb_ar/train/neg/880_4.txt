Garc√≥n Canin wrote this view to the "modern era" in Las Vegas and the intergenerational gap, his first effort since 1940! David Jansen is a somewhat fatal mistake as a big shot casino owner unites with his son (Robert Dreyfas, who looks as worrying as the older Jason Bateman). Jansen approaches each scene in the same way: defensively, with a slide on his shoulder. This wonderful role playing and recreation is often asked by Jansen, who barks at everyone like a vile husband (even chews without Riklis and makes him cry!). His son, a good friend looking for his identity, makes elaborate comments about how young people look at Las Vegas (giving them another 10 years) and denounces his father's way of life. Brenda Vaccaro is attractive as a conscious secretary and Eddie Williams has a girl in the test. Unfortunately, "Where It At" does not have a lot of other unfriendly things now about ethics among adults and their children, some quick snapshots of T & A and ludicrous parodies on the world of high bets for gambling - most of which have now been covered, Ad nauseam. ** from ****
