I began to watch this film and I expect some of the horror film that is barely tolerable ... I was not far away. There are quite a few peep holes, and they threw a lot of nudity, but the last half of the film presents some sarcastic twists. Sacred Cow, they put a bit into the story, and did not fit into the expected things one would expect at first. I dare say that some "unjustified" coercion was not at all rewarding, because it is consistent with the story and the preparation. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me, it's still a bad movie, but with the continuation of the bad movies, this color has become more intelligent than the real horror movie like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
