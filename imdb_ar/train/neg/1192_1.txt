I totally agree with jamrom4 .. This was the most horrible movie I've ever seen ... Holy nonsense was terrible .. I was warned of seeing it ... and the folly I saw anyway .. About 10 minutes of the painful experience I gave up completely Watching the atrocities .. But I sat down to the end .. Only to see if I could .. Well I did now and I wish now that I did not .. It was disgusting .. Nothing happened and the end was all preaching .. No bad film has the right To survive .. I appeal to you all to survive the fatty horror that drives the bus .. If you have heard the same warning only .. please save Physic of this film .. I have a feeling that those who are making such a big participated in the making of the film .. They should all be wiped off the face of the planet ..
