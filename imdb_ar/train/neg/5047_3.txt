I did not really comment, but I thought I had something to say. I have watched this movie two days ago, and although I think it is not a complete waste of time (probably money for producers), it is clear that it faces serious problems. I've got really good cinemas and great music. Much has been said about Anna Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest about what? It is not really represented, it is always balanced between over-representation and under-representation. Her performance goes on forever because there was no one like Odete in any other movie: Crazy? Sad? childish? Juggler? No one knows, colleagues. So they sort of dictate the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was also a good example of the problem experienced by most Portuguese films: sound. There is a constant number of dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of blue. People in other countries may think Portugal is the most noisy place. But what surprised me was that some of the dialog box was named but did not necessarily solve this syndrome. Dubbing is very bad, I must say. It is strange to see a film showing the first thing that amazes me in the first scene, when the first person speaks: Call it. All this to say that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> He also has text problems. Try to be a classic from first to last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things hanging and this shows. It is clear that the writer was trying to correct everything and he does so ... but he shows up !! Each dialog box is very complex and there is not one discussion that looks like a line from a movie. Everything is a bit weird and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This is not a complete mess, I must stress. I only think that the good parts are so obvious that I prefer focusing on the bad parts. <br /> <br /> The trend only leads to a weak scenario. All the clips are classic and not innovative, but beautiful. Great work by Rui Po√ßas, by the way. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think is the problem, the problem that prevents people from believing this story and laughing throughout the film rather than taking it seriously: the man who plays the man who dies is obviously not a representative. In fact, it is a fairly important role and I can not see why non-actors are represented for such parts. This man is neither a representative nor a good-looking man. This means that the whole film is rolling over the mountain. We never think for a second that this wonderful woman is obsessed with him even though he is gone, and that his great lover, who survived, suffers from a bad time in fact overcoming the loss. so sad. The world is full of beautiful people who are so seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also nice children and are able to cause people's concerns after their departure. The world is full of great movies and also great movies. This is life!
