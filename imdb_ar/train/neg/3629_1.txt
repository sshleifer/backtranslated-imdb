(Various spoilers continue) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly. Not George Gotek, who sometimes criticizes being too young and not French. Not Leslie Karon, who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, who often bothers me with the Dickens. <br /> <br /> No, it will definitely be Jeanne Kelly. There is something about his character on the screen, he is very ambitious and centered on being persuasive as a busty artist in Paris, content postponed by critics indefinitely, shivering with young children and old ladies and drawing in the streets. That's what made him so effective in SINGIN's rain and in other films where he played ambitious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan is a fairly cousin to Tommy Albright in Brigadon, another Lerner story with Kelly Meskast as an American at loose ends falling in love with a beautiful European place and an innocent female embodying her virtues. <br /> <br /> But Jerry is not as popular as poor Tommy. This is something ridiculous in this film. Jerry is sometimes close to Mello, and worse than Liz. When the latter sees a club, he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him. When she sits down again pulls a more filthy trick to get her phone number. When he calls her the next day, she wakes up, which he considers a cue to bring down in her workplace. During all this, obviously she does not want to do anything with him. When you start to laugh at his jokes at the perfume store, it's as true as Milo's interest in his paintings. He certainly has good looks and play, but why should she influence that when she gets Henry, who looks like a gentleman to take off? <br /> <br /> It is admittedly partly depressing because of the actress. If she plays a role like Liz, for example, Judy Garland, she will bat Jerry with insults and angry grunts. If played by Cyd Charisse, one would admire his courage. But when Leslie Caron first plays her role, she behaves and acts like a shy and weak teenager, and as a result Jerry seems just crawling. And why did they choose these other actors (although I personally prefer to solve things by changing the intro) when the whole story stops on the love story of these two poor young men who break themselves from their gentle commitments to wealthy old people? Not only is Gene Kelly a few years before Gokic and Fuchs, but he is old enough to be Karun's father. <br /> <br /> In short, I think it would have been possible to improve everything by throwing some of the young comedians in the role of Jerry. , A genre that usually appeared in musical support roles ... for example Ray MacDonald in Good News or Bobby Van in Little Town Girl. Maybe not necessarily but someone they like. Someone could have chased Lisa and made him seem mercilessly fun; someone would have shown a really happy life in the chaplainsque hole; someone who had varied humor and naivet√© with the strangely intriguing Oscar Levant. Maybe it would make the ballet seem less important. This may be a voice that could better sing Gershwin. <br /> <br /> All of this may give the impression that I do not like Jane Kelly. I love him. He has been wonderful in most of his films, not this film (well, some other films). I do not despise AAIP itself, either; it has good points, such as technical direction. Leslie Karon, who despite her lack of experience, actually looks like she came out of a painting. Georges Guetary is doing well and "Stairway to Paradise" is my favorite film. Nina Fuch is beautiful and touching should end with some. But not Jerry Muligan. I do not wish it.
