Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is absurd to see him as a lovable romantic presenter. The fact that he dances well, dips effectively, and throws himself into the part in a way that makes him seem creepy. In his most sad moments (with the girl at the train station, in the last issue with Rosie), I could not lift my eyes from him was very repellent. You kept expecting him to give up the gentle act and start gurgling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, and the only performance that was better than 1963. By the way, if you watch musical production, 1963 and 1995, you'll see three versions with more reviews (different songs and the same songs for different characters and in different situations) The musical I have seen in my life
