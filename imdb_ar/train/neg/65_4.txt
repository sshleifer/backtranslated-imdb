I do not get a rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was already the type that gave it 4 out of 10. What could have been a wonderful story with a group of decent actors or at least became a complete farce in my eyes. There are a lot of clich√©s in those dark, women's hair is just awful and most scenes are more unrealistic or fake. There is no real passion in this film, but there are a group of actors who act excessively on any boundaries that hurt them. It's not funny to be a comedy, it's very sad to really touch it, so I do not think it's good. Watching it I could not believe how something like that made it reach my TV in the living room in Switzerland. But .. Maybe it was still fine and just lost in translation? Who do you know? Definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen and this is definitely not a good way! Sorry.
