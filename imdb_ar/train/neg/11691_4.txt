It seems to me that the name of the pen that Stephen King called "Bachman" was a way to put down some of the darker and more enthusiastic things he wanted to write without "polluting" his trade name. If you look back at Bachman's books (Running Man, The Long Walk, Rodok, Insomnia), you notice that they have a feeling sealed with nervousness and despair about them is different from the prevailing king. I realize that we are talking about the man whose first novel appeared to be a humiliating, bloodthirsty, emotionally paralyzed girl, and everyone slaughtered at her high school school party ... But the king always has characters and conspiracy elements that ease the gloom of the proceedings a little, and most of them have ends that offer at least a glimpse of hope and feeling Humanitarian assistance. Bakhman's books are just plain meaning and always end badly. (BTW, "Pet Semetary" could easily have been Bachman's book if King did not reveal the alias by then.) "Half Dark" seems at least in part to be his "Bachman" character. <br /> </ p> <p> /> "The thinner" was Bachman's latest book, The Man, with his themes about class warfare, revenge, and death through famine, which is bad. So it should not be a surprise that the film follows suit. <br /> <br /> The surprise is that the amendment seems to have been filmed at the level of "talent from a TV movie" of talent rather than something worthy of theatrical version. (These days, something like this might move directly to a DVD or cable). The work of make-up and ornamentation (hunger to death in the midst of abundance, a metaphor for the undernourished American middle class, if there is one) is all that makes you see this imbalance. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? My first idea is that the director was going to attend the bad Bachman, but he also somehow got all the attention from the film with bad choice options - the actors here (except Joe Monetegna) can not simply carry the film. Then smash the warmth and life of the rest of the film with a puzzling speed and scene structure. In addition to that he can not leave the plot alone, and his changes do not really help. The script and dialogue must work, but the film mostly falls just there. Everything is discreet, boring, without ventilation, and no fun to watch ... with the obvious exception of the main character scene that gets .... thinner, insomnia and insomnia. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, "Thinner" is by no means the worst film produced by King (or even the second worst). His charm is intriguing and appealing because of his appearance and meticulous make-up. But for the first time viewers have to deal with this with less expectations.
