Henry Kendall and Joanne Barry, bored of Fred and Emily Hill, have progress in inheritance. They use the money goes travel. Their lives become more exciting because they begin relationships with Betty Alien Safety (to Mr. Kendall) and Lonely Percy Marmont (to Ms. Barry). But they remain as dull as they were before. The controversial director, Alfred Hitchcock, tries to revive the famous concept (as quoted in The Tempest) of Shakespeare by Rich and Ghreib by asking for some deception in the camera. Greeting banner to the "crowd" King Fedor is the highlight. The low point may be to have the couple eat on a prepared Chinese cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock - Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
