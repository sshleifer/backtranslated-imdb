I think Croc Hunter is a wonderful guy! I know I will not get the nerve because I go away up to 5 meters from the crocodile. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. The nagging jokes, the people eating, and the play about the president make the film one of the worst events ever. <br /> <br /> It's a really bad movie you have to keep away from. All "jokes" are so juicy that you will find yourself laughing because they are stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
