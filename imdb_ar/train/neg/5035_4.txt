Melissa's 16th birthday is just around the corner, and she just discovers her sexuality with the boys. But it turned out that all the men who spend their time with all the winds end up killing them in the 80s movie this year. It is up to local town mayor Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, Wild Punch) and his naughty and suspicious daughter Judy, Marcy (Dana Kimmel, Friday 13 Part 3) to get to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on ambiguities and melodrama in the film and to a lesser extent on the killings themselves, and thus is able to distinguish itself from many of his brothers in the 1980s in Slasher. It does not hurt that Alicia has a great body (I feel the need to emphasize what is evident with the fact that the actress has over 18 years old and therefore I was informed that I am not excessively skewed). On the downside, the film hampers some unsophisticated and unnecessary plot points, an annoying subject often used a bit, and the end being anti-weather. But good is better than bad (barely). Give this rent, but I will not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Alisa Shirley shows her nipples, her hair and her ass <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C <br /> Additions Code Red DVD: Introduction to Star Alissa Shirley and Director of the Dakhil, Scott Spiegel ; A copy of both the director and the play of the film; an audio conversation with Shirley Star and director Jim Sutus; an interview with Shirley and Sotos and Bob Hopkins; still a trailer trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
