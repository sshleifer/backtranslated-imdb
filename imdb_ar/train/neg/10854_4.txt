Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a film where our attention is drawn to subtle subtle nuances. This is not a film, where the special effects are supposed to leave us in separate clothes from this sense of identity. What is, however, is a piece of Gothic horror that leaves little imagination, created in the eyes of the director, Alex Chandon, as "a reaction to the 1970s and the '80s." > This is a very incisive experiment for two hours, where four plot lines are connected through a lot of watery blood, and rems of fragmented body parts and innards, linked by an intestinal flux of revenge. <br /> <br /> The provider of such horrific violence Is Danny Philth, the lead singer in the metal band Cradle of Faith, and he plays a role he was due to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new In this particular context, Kimber, the convicted sexual murderer, the father of our angelic retaliation, forces his son to exact revenge for those who are linked to each other by convicting them of cleansing him into a mad refuge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chandon, who should be congratulated for the completion and editing of this article, is the opportunity to let his sick mind run away for free, and seems happy to have the idea of ​​splashing blood into openings on the screen, in every accessible corner and corner. We also deal with close-ups to crush the skull, satanic rape, and other miscellaneous images to engage those who enjoy the personal approach of their horror. For some of those who are closely following this type of film, there is a strange sequence that might think, "Did you just see what I thought I did," and of course this beautiful woman is "not pretty." It reminds me of some of the festivals that have arisen from the Italian horror about 20 to 30 years ago, and a number of other works where the disgusting images left their imprints, but not the context in which they were seen. <br /> <br /> Story 4 of the group is particularly interesting where the idea of ​​obsession can eventually lead to death through Internet violence through the "patient's room" where the user controls how life can be extracted. Other submissions must also go to a soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his talent during the day and to effectively use drums and bass, often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of supporting visual images. Using the city of London as a backdrop for real people rather than stand-by positions also adds support to the film's commandos. Well, it may not be classically, but blood, courage, intestines, elbows and demons in a somewhat mild way.
