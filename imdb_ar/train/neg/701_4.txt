During the Christmas holiday, a group of college friends stayed behind to help prepare the destroyed houses and replace them with residential buildings. To make the work a little more difficult, a fatal psychological flop wears Chuck's game in the bedrooms and feeds on the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> It was recorded as one of the forty-seven videos listed by the United Kingdom in the 1980s, and The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation before it premiered. The term "video nasty" takes into account some images of some obvious big ideas, violence, sex, etc.: all the things that the terrifying dream of horror dreams. So, after hearing all this information, I settled into the Pranks (alternative title) I expect a rude and unpretentious experience. . . That's what he tried to be, but he completely failed completely. Visually, the film is not great. Cinema, Gore (except for a few scenes), and the whole trend fail. It's simply not fun to watch. The non-original script does not exist and often throws random objects without any real reason (such as opening murder). There are some wonderful death scenes, including the beautiful face melting (which can be seen on the label), but this is positive. The acting is very bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and he has the only major mistake that any flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, for a film made by a few Los Angeles University students in Los Angeles for $ 90,000 (which will be more than double that day), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a complete mess. He has a few good things, which is somewhat apt. . . But as a slash that looks to be on the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . Can not compare. Do not expect too much, and may be at least amusing. I hate to say that, but this is one of the few films I've seen which will actually be better with a remake. . . So far, they follow great works like Black Christmas. Oh, okay. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory Terrorist Elements: <br /> <br /> - Sub Site: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some heinous deaths, and the predominance is fine for the most part . . . But nothing special. Also, they have shown some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unattractive nudity, but not much. <br /> <br /> - Fantastic Killer (s): Nah. The final monologues of the murderer have made him largely unjustified. <br /> <br /> - Fears / Thrill: A jump or two, but nothing is very effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I suppose, yes, but I simply did not care enough, it is as obvious as the nose on the face of the killer. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Bullshit! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
