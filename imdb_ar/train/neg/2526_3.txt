I do not agree with much of what has been written about this alleged "masterpiece" of the new German wave. <br /> <br /> 1) There are major flaws in the simple presentation, in the basic communication of critical critical points, as in Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald And her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, not to return and restore his wife until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is very unsatisfactory due to arbitrary and accidental. The original script called Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, knowing that her husband had sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria takes the water out of the tap through her wrist in reference to suicide. Then Maria is blown up briefly, rather than having to face the consequences of self-delusion and moral compromise and co-exist with her. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbender seeks to force the public to force the private sector. Profile. Contrary to critics and "experts", I do not think it works. The mere intrusion of historical radio news or the sound of German reconstruction machines in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition for Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is aimed at paralleling the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Maria is supposed to be a special woman of her time and place and reflect them, but in fact is not authentic and undefined. Women assert their independence through the use of sex for self-advancement. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several cases of abominable stagnation and agitation - Vasbender's addiction to drugs and the consequent impatience and lack of interest have had its effect. Unknown people talk about the screen without ever being seen before; music is intrusive elsewhere; melodramatic positions are sporadic alternatives to representation. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, for a film that condemns a country because of deliberate mass amnesia, it never mentions him once.
