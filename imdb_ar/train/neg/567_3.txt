This movie is one of the most awesome movies ever. How can John Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer and not a representative, what? Do vampires kill their guitar? What about the terrible conspiracy? Oh my God this movie really sucks. In the end she is the vampire queen who is played by the eternal vampires Arly Gopher (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the killers arrive "Fantastic" only 4 vampires left! What happened with other vampires 10-15? Running out in the sun ?? And what about the "grand end" when Bon Jovi hit her head with a gun ??? This really is "no". In the movie "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, one vampire was not killed using A SHOTGUN ??? This is really a lack of authenticity!
