This film was badly and in a hurry. I realize that financing any such film is hard to get. However, if the plot contained any kind of original material that someone could have seen that it had received the necessary funding, it would not have been, and such films were not necessary in themselves and had no purpose. The plot for this movie has been performed and done better and I have added it several times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance to compete with anyone else. I have been informed by my computer that I need at least ten lines to render my comment, so the following lines are just a bull to fill the void. In my opinion there is no need to say anything else about this film. What I've said a lot, if you've wasted enough time reading this review, it's for God's sake not to waste more time watching this movie. The only exception is if you are the type who likes to watch the crazy movies that run on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 am in this case, you would rather watch what I care about.
