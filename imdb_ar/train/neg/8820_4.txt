When I go to a movie like me, I never expected anything entertaining except for a wave of murder ... What I got was less. <br /> <br /> On the eve of Christmas in 1947, he saw a child of his parents while doing so while a Santa dressed in a Santa suit. Horrified, he runs on the stairs and cuts himself off. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Staling is the usual daily Jook ..... because of the fact that he is obsessed with Santa. After being ridiculed by his boss, he becomes mad, wearing clothes like Santa and begins to kill his unsympathetic customers with his boss and boss. His neighborhood is gripping and he is about to burn him, driving his car from the cliff ..... to the moon. It was not the best end I saw but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring film that was really of excellent quality only when Harry went to Abishit for church leaders. There was hardly any threat and even the "sexual" scenes were relaxed. Very boring ...... 4 of 10
