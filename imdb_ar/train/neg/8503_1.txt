With all the European studios participating in this studio, you might think you will get at least some beautiful photographs; but the local color stays at the minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 Does Mira Sorvino use a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There is an alleged romantic return story unintentionally confused - is it or is it lesbian? - Do not serve any purpose at all. The policemen in the film are the most stupid who have been awarded a serial killer film for a long time. There seem to be some messages about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, but since all those involved have died, one does not see the point. <br /> <br /> Part of the narrative (which part? of who can say), you do not even get a good look at the bull battle. Ernest Hemingway had blown the director in his nose - my blessings.
