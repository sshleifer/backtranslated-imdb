The immortal, uh, was interesting. She certainly did not kill me for an hour and a half, but she did not impress me too much. A group of children are kidnapped in an alley through the toothy-headed mutants (in a scene characterized by the less convincing sound of the head of the cinema) and transported to a luxury suburban house. Dr. Devine and his team perform brain transplants for the elderly, affluent, so they can get small bodies again. Hey, this has been quietly reshaped with a big budget after several years as FREEJACK! Who knew that when an old man was brainwashed into a different body, his new voice would sound exactly like his old voice? With all this talk about the pineal glands and the use of glowing green serum, you can see insights from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR almost in the producers' heads. But production literally does not have the courage to pull it out. I never understood why, when someone filmed a horror movie with a low budget, they did not pack it quietly on the edge of the frame. The acting is superbly uniform, with only good performance by Clark Lindsley as Dr. Price's assistant. He has a nice wicked laugh. The only other thing we notice about the immortal is that it is characterized by many older people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old people.
