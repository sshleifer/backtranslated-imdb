Years after the fall of the last major companies, the world signed a new dark era where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Cash, a cyborg, travels to an arid doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. In the long run from Recyclers (hunters who hunt for cyborgs), Cash is trying to find its way to Cytown, the legendary haven for Cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (and so far so far) entry into the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally intended to be a complement to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERS, but it was quickly rewritten at the martial arts festival after the horrors that became a form of classical worship due to its gaudy scenes. CYBORG 2: The SHADOW GLAD supplement was already improved on its predecessor but was not widely seen (and rejected by those few who saw it as a cheap feed). <br /> <br /> This movie tries, for one reason, to be mixed between the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a clever Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately was not helpful in either case. Obviously the budget was less than CYBORG 2, where the film was shown in the desert desert lands (like many motion pictures after the end of the world in the 1990s), filmed around old industrial buildings to keep costs down. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is centered on a conspiracy machine, the story of a pregnant Cyborg, which is as interesting as it is silly (this film is not the first to try this idea; ANA OVA ARMITAGE III series uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same trap where many low-budget science fiction films fall victim to the fact that the obstacles presented are nothing more than androids. Visual effects are no more than the effects of prostheses and make-up. <br /> <br /> Representation is a great standard for this type of film, where the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) is the worst performer on the screen. Instead of being happy with the news you carry, she acts as hard as she can. The stars involved are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual gangster genre that activates the scenes in which he appears and Richard Lynch enjoys a lot of fun as the main villain. It is worth mentioning Andrew Benarsky, playing the role of Lynch Right, which will later appear in the Texas edition of Chasino Maskaker and Bricol.
