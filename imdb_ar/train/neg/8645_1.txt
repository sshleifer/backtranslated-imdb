I have just returned from this free offer, and this "Witchcraft Project of Osama" is the worst film I have seen this year, worse than the "Cat Woman" - which had the wisdom to pass itself at least as a fantasy. <br /> <br /> In "The September Ribbon," a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" goes to Afghanistan - although they are not fully prepared for the trip, the circumstances, and oh yes, their cynical and ironic revenge filmmaker to avenge his wife's death September 11 - To track down Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They have "made" eight tapes on their journey, which "now" document their travels, and of course, their travel attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (Fortunately, all eight tapes end with important points in the novel, suitable for a "documentary film." <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the stupid mental novel - thrown at long and important speeches that might know to see "MacGyver" - no He cares about his life or the lives of his innocent crew because he makes them more and more vulnerable through a series of totally stupid incidents, I do not know why he did not wear just a mark on his back saying "shoot me." <br /> <br /> His reasonable logical voice, more than just moans and baffles as the hero of idiots leads them to death. <br /> <br /> I wish they had brought someone on their trip to call They are all. <br /> <br /> About "Tape 4", I begin to take root for the terrorists to film the crew.
