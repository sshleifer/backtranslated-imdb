I will not criticize the film. There is not much to talk about. They have good animal action scenes that were probably spectacular at the time. Clyde Petty is not exactly the original idol. It's a little slight and not particularly good appearance. But this is fine. He is the man in this lion cage. We know that when he can not spend too much time off his blackness to tend to his girlfriend, he will end up on an island and be forced to save the day. One of them said earlier that he had studied history. The sights of the circus are another day, especially the children walking around. I did not realize that even in the 1930s they sailed on three hooligans. It looked like something from 1860. I think this is the stock footage they have. No wonder the thing has been smashed. They always talk about reform. There are even dirigible. It tells us a bit about the relationships between males and females at the time, a kind of gross tampering. But if you do not take it seriously, you can enjoy watching it.
