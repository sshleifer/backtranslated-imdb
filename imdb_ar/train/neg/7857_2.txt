Does anyone else feel tired of the old cliches in which an almost dead person appears in a horror film, giving us some information, and then bursting his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that its use in this film is worthless. If you've seen the first movie (the first release I have to say), the information provided is completely worthless, because you already know it. I think you can not care about the main characters ... But then why does the fool hit himself in the head? Does not he want to live? Sure, he would have died anyway .. <br /> <br /> This is the second film called "The Hills Have Eyes II." The first is the sequel to the original 70 film. This is where it gets a bit complicated for someone like me. See, I may be part of a minority of people in my age who knew that there was HHE2, much less than the original HHE1. Now that we have become a complement to the reshaping and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the complement to the original HHE1 ... it makes it worse! But in any case .. <br /> <br /> The hills of the original eyes at Wes Craven were fit. In the end, though, the idea was better than the presentation, but probably had a low budget. To be quite honest, Wes Craven is not a good director of horror. He has made some good horror movies only (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good movies (Scream) and a bunch of horror movies (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yeah, and making Swamp Thing, well ... but the original HHE2 falls under the last category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> He has now co-authored the new HHE2 book .. This is a disappointment! Last year was a remake of HHE better than the original film. He was nervous. I think it's about the fact that the main characters were a family and not a bunch of beer, beer and crazy teenagers. They made us feel dirty. At the first hour, we were in hell, and finally in the last few moments, the good guys took revenge on the bad guys and felt good. <br /> <br /> This new film has no tension. No suspense at all. Only violent things happen to mostly stupid people. There is hardly any threat here. Just the ugly hobbits hiding under the rocks. <br /> <br /> Tired of horror movies where people die because of stupid mistakes they continue to commit. It was on that day when I was watching "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel Jackson continued walking around the water during the speech, then eating a shark, just because the idiot stayed close to the water ... something nobody would do in the given position! Here is exactly the same. People explode on their own to leak even though they know that people are dying ... seriously, can not a potty rest? Then when you think that people have learned, the other person will go on his own! Seriously, is not it more scary when the characters bring their own game A and still lose? I think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even under delivery. It was supposed to be the first new version resembling the remodeling of "fog" (which was less threatening than the "Becker" episode). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. Most of all. <br /> <br /> But it actually reduces the rating. Less bad guys. Without tension. Sure we have more time in the caves, but not much of the whole happening there. In the end, it just seems that there are two or three of the bad guys. Making the last film looks like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Which continues to be seen through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things that this film should have brought to us, but it ends with the same promise as the last film, with exactly the same "watch" scene. Come on! I will give the devil that he is worthy. The appearance of the film is good ... but this. <br /> <br /> I do not even think Gore's fans will like this ... even though I'm wrong! There is a gore (although most of it is accelerated while in the dark), but without tension, and the characters that are interested in it so .. Do not take injustice injustice in my book! In the end, you are not afraid. You, do not shock (unless a girl is 8 years old). You do not even feel that you have seen something new.
