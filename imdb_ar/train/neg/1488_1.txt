I had to sign up for IMDb just to post a comment on how horrible this movie is ... My cat and the string ball have a better story than this. It was not the worst I've ever seen, but when all the elements of the film are almost completely cleared within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to the desired level. There was not a single "scare" moment in the film, except when they were watching the movie "Halloween" on television. Everywhere, it seems that it could have been a good story, as she was giving up credits and saying that Chasey Lain had some loss because I did not immediately recognize her and that her scene was already over before I said "Oh yeah, there she is." I am very happy to see this in a hotel and I did not pay for it because I would be delighted if I paid a cent to see this. I usually like or I can find a refund factor in a film at least, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not so good, it's bad ... it's very bad.
