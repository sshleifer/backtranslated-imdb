Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the latest series of serials, and like Part 4, has nothing to do with the first three except by the title and the fact that it is a flick titled Christmas. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Gavlin, there are some obvious things happening here ... Mickey Rooney plays a playmaker named Joe Pieto and his scary son name is Pino. Percussion bell, anyone? Now, he heard a little boy named Derek knocking the door one night, opening it to find a gift on his doorstep. Although he said "do not open until Christmas", he begins to open it anyway, but is stopped by his father, who rebukes him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. Inside, a small red ball scatters Santa's arms and head, and continues to kill my father. Oops, maybe he should have left alone enough. Of course Derrick was shocked by the accident because he saw him on the stairs, but he did not grow up to be a deadly Santa, he stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious stranger lying, who seems to be very interested in Joe Pete's games. We see him buying a handful when his mother Derek takes him to the store to find a gift to get him out of shock. What exactly does this man do? Well, we are not sure that he seems to be separating these games to see what makes them knock. He prevents the landlord from evicting him by promising to pay him cash the next day and giving him the Larry the Larvae for his children, but of course Larry is not a good game and comes out of a box in the car and of course, well, things are not pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the end, what happened with Joe Peto and Pino is revealed of course, and as with the old story, Pino is not so "real boy". Pino may be more exciting because he suffers from a "soft" plastic cinch so that he can explain his evil ways. Revealed the identity of the stranger lurking also, there is a kind of happy ending of some kind. Whee. <br /> <br /> Step from part 4, but not one step. Again, Brian shares a budget, and Mad George screams, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. There are a few remnants of part 4 also outstanding, such as Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but this does not really make any difference. Anyway, I now see the entire string of my system. Now if I could get some of it out of my mind. 4 of 5.
