I came to this film really wanted to line up. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting film. Make no mistake here, I did not expect citizen Sittan, I was dealing with this film for B. However, it is still below expectations. The historical side of the story was over with glass and left me a bit cold. The acting in the film was very woody. In general, I gave it 4 a great idea, but it was possible to record the film much higher with more attention to the rules of film production. Is it really worth watching? I did not want my watch, but I do not know I recommend it to others.
