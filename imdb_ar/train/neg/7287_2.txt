<br /> <br /> In his youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade it. After several decades, the old man raised three children (boys and girls) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. The sister soon becomes bored with Brother No.1, and jumps on his brother's bed. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three brothers are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are Europeans of the upper class who go to university and are busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see an overwhelming moment between any female unconnected to the two brothers. We do not see any flirtatious moment between any irrelevant male and one sister. All the exhilarating moments between the brothers and sister are shared only. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of the GLADIATOR was the incest. The young emperor Commodus had hundreds of slave girls and a city full of girl-like girls all over him, but no - he wanted his sister only? If Incest is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE will (slowly) stir you up endlessly.
