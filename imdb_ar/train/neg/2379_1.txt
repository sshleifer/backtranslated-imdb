I will confess. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and has made it important to watch every movie she has (unfortunately includes awesome movies like Batman, Robin, Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> This movie should be rated as the worst movie I have ever seen. (Yes is ranked less than Avengers). Everyone seems lost and incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess just like I do, please do not put this movie to yourself. You will hate yourself the next morning for that.
