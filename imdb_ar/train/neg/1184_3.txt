This movie sounding plot was fairly good, but the paste was very slow ... very slow indeed. Even if there are those who think it is a classic cult, I think there are many better films than that era to watch. <br /> <br /> Cinema is not excellent, but it's not the worst either. Sounds just fine. Lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I still do not recommend this to anyone other than a film student perhaps. <br /> <br /> The movie does not contain music, and horses that do not want sex do not make it good either. The woman who mastered the edge of the bed was completely stupid. <br /> <br /> There is no gain here, to overcome this full boredom. I've seen the worst believe me, but that's just a waste of time, and I do not get good reviews here. Especially high grades ...
