After my children were forced to watch this at least 10 times for the last Christmas, I feel appropriately qualified to judge this version of the classic Dr. Suss story, and Hassani ... It's not very good. First, it would be difficult for anyone, after viewing a classic film such as Chuck Jones' mobile TV show, to have such a heavy and vulgar interpretation that would be wrongly positive. I will admit that there are a handful of inspirational gags, but in general, the film comes as a calculated monetary measure, at the same time that it is supposed to denounce the marketing of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually on the top here, but that goes against Greenshall. As Boris Karloff distinguished, it was a slow burn. Systematic and malicious. There is no way to mad Curry, this is the most obvious mistake only. Gifted actors such as Jeffrey Tambour and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, Global, Why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will play any role (like fellow Michael Kane), but that role needs to be raised under the title "Films that should never have been made." This does not bode well for Cat in the Hat, Universal's biggest cross for Christmas. I feel that I will make the same recommendation for that recommendation as I do with this recommendation: skip it, either read the book or watch your TV. These are two hours you can never go back to.
