Apparently aimed at being a movie that ends up as almost laughing. That prompted me to shout "Oh my God!" Most of the time the complex harmonics of the plot were just silly. <br /> <br /> Imaginary or silly sites simply because of novelty or tragic situation are unlikely, almost impossible, reactions and human circumstances are too much to understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have the time and want to discover how bad a picture is, you'll want to see this image. Otherwise, take some time to watch some dry colors to invest more productive time! <br /> <br /> (The 2003 movie shown on TV in July 2003 may show an indication of the film's quality)
