Oh, let people give this movie a break. The only thing I liked is ......... sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh ya!!!! When John Win came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong film, I was thinking of a film of better quality. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yeah, it was the chick who was from Clueless in it. Do not put out Stacey Dash. I mean, we're all making mistakes. But hey boy, Stacey, you doooooosie work. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that has never been done in a Westerner, and even all the actresses, have already suspended a woman from the gallows. This may be Western first. Although her neck was supposed to have crashed and escaped this ordeal, you should give the director some effort to experience the West first. Also, I never saw a woman executed from a horse in any western, although this did not happen in this film, but I thought I would give the director another idea about Gang Of Roses # 2, which must be done right after Ed Wood's Bride of the Beast # 2. Perhaps this was what the makers of this film were seeking. Orginality, especially with every African woman with an Oriental shepherd. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the Gang of Roses want to complement this mess, you might have such a slang, "Hey, do not be willing in my home girls" and "Talk to the hand, my love "Talk to the hand." You can also have a deputy governor of Surfer, who says things like, "This gunfight was quite a man." You know, things like that.
