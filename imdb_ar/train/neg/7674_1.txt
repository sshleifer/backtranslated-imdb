True, there are so many much worse movies then this movie. This film was not "Manus: The Hand of Destiny" or "Troll 2" (yes, I have seen them both ... twice) but at the same time this film is not "foreigner", "predator" or "even alien against". Predator (yes, this movie exceeded this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like Star Wars it's too bad. Razi's Lookout Awards, your biggest competition has just arrived at the theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course alone in the dark. I will try to take you though the step by step process about why this movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - I will first start with what might be the best element in this film (next to the final credits, which played the role of "Wish I have An Angel," the actor.) Christian Slater should be proud of himself, He could have acted properly in a worse film and then drunk the freeze to talk, he made me wonder why he did not walk out of the group halfway, perhaps because Stephen Dorf was in the film too (someone wishing he had been but he had failed). Reed is a bad actress but good-looking and that's all that really matters in films like this, that does not mean that acting was perfect, it was mediocre, not good, The only sound in the film is not good. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - except for "Wish I have an Angel", the soundtrack is useless and a heavy medallion is thrown in the audience's ears, perhaps to hide the horrifying story (something I'll get It is now showing a long and expensive soundtrack on two music CDs. <br /> <br /> The Directing - Directed by Hollywood director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. That gets quite bad and this is just the beginning of my deadly salt of horrible films. " At least it is said to be directed by Oy Paul. Without being told, I had guessed that a monkey had been abducted from the Congo, brought here and forced to give an opinion on how to make the film shock. The director of photography may have been a videotape recorded on the skateboard and pushed forward to the wall. In the scenes where the camera must remain stationary, moving constantly, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when in motion, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Product - from the ground is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity an idiot ... sometimes. Sometimes, I'm happy because he or she has learned such a lesson by not putting money on the trash worse, then the dog droppings are tied in a bag. <br /> <br /> Typing / storyboard - trying to analyze the story is more painful then ice-jamming under a big toe and kicking football as hard as possible immediately afterwards but I'm still going to try it. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby, a child from an orphanage where 20 children are fleeing to where to go under scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is where I became so bad I started laughing out loud). After that, he soon progressed quickly after several years, where he was investigating paranoia. He is attacked by some zombie who can not be shot, killed and continues to live. Later he was attacked by some crazy monsters and discovered secrets unknown to anyone. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really bad. The film stops with about 10 minutes, which I feel like 100, of a random text about an incorrect civilization called Abskani. The film does not go to one by one, where the public can handle it, and more the public wants to deal with it, and more the public can take care of it. This story is very bad, so that the performance of the "Double Dragon" better. <br /> <br /> In general, I miss this movie. I gave him 1 out of 10 but that's because there is not 0.
