A group of models are looking for an apartment to live in, one of which shows a local real estate agent. Unknown to the client and models, is that the "threshold of hell" is in the apartment and when crossing it, the demon is called "Dethman" to kill everyone in his way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Although I am a champion of low-budget films, small budget and independent films, I can not praise this film. Creators pride themselves on their 24-hour photography schedule and at least one actor boasts a video of his talent for acting, but I can not wrap my head around it. Why is the movie made within 24 hours? If there is an extra hour or two of editing, will the difference occur? Why is it proud of a representation that is weak and illogical and leads to poor delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> Through a large part of the movie, models are displayed on parts of an apartment by a real estate agent. The dialog box is clearly intended for ads because no scriptwriter can output this blank text. It is clear that the employee knows nothing about housing ... She focuses on aspects of the house that no one can care about, and incorrectly explains the source of heat (see the radiator?) And says that the insect problem will be solved when they call it a "break." Please, type a script - some deviation is fine, but this was a mess. <br /> <br /> Why were girls moving in models? Their career has had no point in the plot, and it seems that this situation is forced. At some point, the personal actress breaks and says something to the effect of "dude, it will be (surprise)" which looks more natural than any other line, even though it is out of place because of the other bad dialog box. <br /> <br /> The devil had no meaning. I appreciate trying to explain how the "threshold of hell" goes to random places on the ground (including residential stoves), but why do not I explain where the devil came from? His background includes a man whose love was killed by another man. How does this make you a demon? (Also, why did we need all the memories of the Victorian past without any dialogue and looks across a field?) It was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The tragic breaks between the lines were terrible. Sam Bishop's character was far worse, with the interviewer not lagging behind. Does each question require a pause, a funny face and a response ... followed by a pause, a funny face and a response? I was very frustrated. For me, the only point was to take time ... but I prefer to have thirty minutes of good delivery over an hour of terrible delivery (and then waste more time passing through the same credits twice). <br /> <br /> Who was Sam Bishop's character, anyway? Allegedly, he "watched" all of this and accused of killing the girls, but never in a part of the story with the girls. How did he see them? And if he did not, how did Ditman kill them? If he did not see Dietman, how could he know that Dietman was the spirit of the apostles? I was so lost ... Was there a plot outline when this was written? <br /> <br /> The only part I found interesting in this film was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. This is not really important or anything, but it was the only rest of the boredom that I received. I wonder what the director Felix Diaz was thinking. His music is very good (see DVD) (behind the scenes for his upcoming playback), but I wonder about his filmmaking skills. Although the best part of the DVD was the video of "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than wasting the entire time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry because I have to be very tough. I would like to think that this film was a test of what could be done within 24 hours or maybe just a fun experience and the idea was not to produce a good movie at all. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is any indication, Diaz can make quality ... so why chose to avoid it here? Perhaps the world will never know.
