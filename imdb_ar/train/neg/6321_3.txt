I can not imagine anyone wanting to watch this movie in a million years. Not because they were one of the worst at all (they were not) but largely because they are about 20 years old and ohh from the mainstream. I was trying to figure out where I had seen a representative before and this was highlighted. So, yes, one of the children stops playing a small role in the league because he does not like nuclear weapons, which is a major media interest and a quick solution to the Cold War. End. This is certainly a fantasy, but one of them will anger John Lennon. Since terrorism has replaced communism as a terror that scares the hell out of us, this film has nothing to do with, except that it is (inaccurate) looking back at those times. Writing, acting, and cinematography are similarly undeveloped. The reason I rated it as high as I did because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have a small place in my heart for that, but I now realize that the mustard has not broken. So, if the law of large numbers is true and eventually one decides to check out this movie, you should realize that there are far better ways to spend your time, but also worse. (I will abstain from John S. Terady at the moment.)
