Let me start by saying I consider myself one of the most (most!) Movie viewers open up ... Films are my passion, I am a regular regular in the local movie rental shop. .. I also feel the need to add that they often ask me advice about movies whenever I get there, and I seem unable to leave the place without a discussion or exchange of ideas on what is happening in the area of ​​worship cinema ... I love to rent things strange, This is precisely why one of the players recommended the place of the film - the worship of the video. He told me he thought I should see this and because the cover said something about being a Jodorowsky (my favorite!) Movie, I hired it. <br /> <br /> My vote here is not really fair, because I did not think it was awful, I just do not know how to evaluate it in another way. The question mark might be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only movie that made me feel sad on my stomach: I already felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally turned? However, I did not want to turn it off, or maybe I could not because I was so fascinated ... <br /> <br /> I never wanted to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Not as awful, as I said. Just do not drink a cup of tea (or vodka in this regard) ...
