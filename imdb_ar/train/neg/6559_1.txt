My girlfriend chose this one. As an African-born American born in the South, this film's conspiracy and hypothesis have been completely found without credibility. The belief that class and racial prejudices will be easily and easily suspended will only come from a completely unfamiliar person in the south. Totally fucking! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andy McDowell (who knows better south) to share this nonsense
