This is a candidate to experience the most frustrating films in my life. Fantastic title, excellent director (I saw "Die for" and "Cowboy Pharmacy" before this), and welcome - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that's the question that shuddered in my temples for hours after I saw this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disagreement and non-aggressive in an attempt to overcome your passion, this is a dead area of ​​a movie should be avoided at all costs. The lambasting was well deserved. You have here one rare film that does not contain one replacement quality. Zero from ****.
