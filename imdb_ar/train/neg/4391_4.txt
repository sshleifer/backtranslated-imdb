Harry Harrison, the young scientist, continues to research his late father in renewing the parties in volatile colors, but his mother, who is obsessed with her medical lover, wants to sell the serum. When he discovers it, there is an accident involving the loss of Harry's arm. So, he tries to try the serum and what happens in the end is a genetically distorted arm with his own mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen this a couple of times before, but what drives this very unwanted, highly unwanted camp is the performance of the film icons Elk Somer and Oliver Reed. Actually not a flick about Fangoria movies; there are only the best ones, which are similar in vein. "Served relationships" simply lack their distinctive style. Similar to the eccentric nature and unpleasant spots of "re-animation" and even a touch of vibratory vibrating like something from "Dead Evil 2". <br /> <br /> The comedy story is really funny with a black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a little dry in the fun factor. Surprises explode, especially the final result of the flick. This is well accepted, as I thought it would have been possible to get rid of something easily accessible. For low-budget production, FX's makeup can seem very rigid and dumb, but there are some wonderful moments that will make you smile at the actual crowd. Even a brush of sexual tension simplifies the story, thanks to the elk's juicy performance Sumer as a mother. Oliver Reid is a dead end in a sense of humor in a wicked sense and pulls him very well. They were both largely transformed as a couple I loved to hate. Billy Morissett is fun in a wrong performance like Harry. Directed by Damon Santostivano, the film brilliantly arranges some elegant scenes of horror that reigns in terror and porcelain. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's basically nonsense, but you have to hand it over for some leisurely entertainment.
