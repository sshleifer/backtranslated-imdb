It will be very difficult to try to think of something that is not interesting. Many problems. The result is terrible and full of proven holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays Betty Garrison, the Secret Service agent who "took one" for Reagan while trying his life. Years later, we found a certain house for the Whitehouse family, especially as the guardian of the first lady (Kim Basinger, Los Angeles). Problems arise when we see the involvement of a close house with the First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rush, United 93). When Pitt fails to test the lie detector, he was selected as a disgruntled client by investigator David Breckenridge (Kiefer Sutherland, TV series 24). <br /> <br /> As the presidential assassination plot unfolds, Pitt finds himself running away from his own people. His only friend is the first lady, and she is reluctant to tell anyone about their emotions to each other (which is why the house failed in the lie detector in the first place). But is a house really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time to kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the attempted assassination while fleeing the secret service? <br /> <br /> The big, overwhelming problem of this film is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Is not that supposed to be the film? One might think so! But the public is never allowed to enter into the reason why the murderer (killers) wanted to kill the Prizes. they. Someone forget to put it in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> What is the new partner of David Breckenridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, Carlyte Wise)? They seem to have been neatly placed into the film as a piece of candy - $$. What was its goal again? Have you done anything else that looks nice in tight pants and low blouse? <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with The Sentinel's basic premise to be funny. The procedure is easily frustrated by "what ...?" The responses are sure to be pronounced by these founders enough to watch the film.
