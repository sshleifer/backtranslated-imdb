Just because an event really happened does not mean it will produce a good script / film. The cat's meow, by Peter Bogdanovich, claims to be based on real events on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hearst. Primer writer more attention to the creation of a strange group of characters rather than spend time to create a story of exotic characters in which you live. The basic moments in the story seem unreasonable; for example, when Hearst accidentally fires the product, believing it to be Chaplin. The basic element of a story about a person wearing the wrong hat is vulgar and vulgar. The story is trying to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow lacks an important part of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy with any of the characters. It does not matter who is shot and who is killed and who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong personality to cheer them out. As a result, conflicts are difficult to address and the end result is incidental.
