The trend should be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talking about a comedy play for the Volti Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first section was very flimsy and not funny. The second section was too harsh to be funny. The third was just flimsy enough to be funny. This kind of attention to detail is missing from "Corky Romano". No matter how disappointed some comics were, they were not fixed or left on the floor of the cutting room. The only value I can find in this film is as a study of a very flawed film that somehow escaped into distribution without reform. <br /> <br /> I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time reinforces my skepticism that some people are paid for the promotion of titles. I can not understand how anyone over the age of 9 can label this address more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, average 5. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money from it, classify it as much as usual. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst films of all time. Hey hey, I actually love the three geeks and I can even bear Ed Wood!
