If I have to give this film a degree on a linear scale, then I should give it a low grade 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was amusing, and there are many good things to say about the film. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist James Bishop was appointed to St. Andrew's Hospital for his residency and came out keen to "change the world". <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film you know the hospital hides a sinister reality, but James thinks it can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly good, as you all the time know that there is a truth to what patients say about some resident evil, and they wonder when and how James discovers it. Also when the break comes, James is on his way to look for evil, and you will feel some suspense until the "battle" ends. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful innocent girlfriend up in the worst possible time and other standard horror items and you can get the picture. <br /> <br /> The accumulation of characters is actually pretty good, you know most of the people who kill them, some of them "get to know them". The film presents an unpleasant scene, and this is also pretty well done. There are secrets that are unveiled - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very reasonable - the story about a keen student started to work well in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * stupid special effects - a recent version of "Plan 9 of Outer Space" - a bad type (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * some bad behavior (or maybe takes very little at Photography) - The main characters sometimes behave badly, and sometimes good. * Sound is very cheap at times. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "I can make a movie like this using my home video camera" throughout the film.
