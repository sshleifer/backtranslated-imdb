"If this bride, as you can see, crashed to death because of this statue on her wedding day, then a year later her ex-fianc√© falls into a beautiful psychological love." She will not be able to steal her friend. <br /> <br /> This, I would like to imagine, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed of "more than her dead body", introduced his concept to the executive studios there in New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how these big companies themselves turn in their direction and light up the green light of the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film and script. <br /> <br /> Because if you think that a movie can not possibly be as bad as this original assumption seems, then obviously you have another idea coming. The only way she can succeed is if the writer has simply gone crazy and turned it into an unprotected phonetic farce. Instead, wanting to make sure that he made a mysterious romantic comedy that is not full of heat, Lowell shares in half-boring measures every step of the way, reducing the absurdity of the terrible originality. In fact, "more than her dead body" is incompetent and not so funny that it is hard to know where to think to Will exactly what he is going to. Almost every gag in the preparation, humor and appearance of the film is well executed and poorly executed, even with the actors themselves apparently realizing their predicament. How else can we illustrate the miserable affectionate performance of Paul Rhode, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bill and Jason Biggs in their different roles? <br /> <br /> I chose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their talents in better cars in the past (this is especially the case with Rod). But Lowell and those certain studios certainly have some of the "stunning".
