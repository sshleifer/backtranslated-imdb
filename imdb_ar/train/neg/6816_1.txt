I must say that there is nothing wrong with low-budget movies, so my problem was not. My problem was that I felt I was watching my neighbor's movie next door. Everything about it seemed to IMO like a person who wrote a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. I understand how difficult it is to do this effectively, but when I pay for a movie, I expect to feel that I am watching some kind of professionally made films. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge autobiography, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. Other people in it did not. I understand how it should be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as a list of representatives, but that does not mean convincing you to act. It seemed as if he had been filmed, he was trying to give many scenes a more interesting appearance, but when writing, planning and acting are present, this type of style will not be necessary, distraction. <br /> <br /> Also at the technical level, it contained digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all these luxury cars, when they did a slow scan of her, they seemed to shiver back and forth a bit. The problem is not in my viewing device (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal) but somewhere in the production I have not seen this kind of artifact in a professionally made film before, and then there was a sound. In sound, which may be fine unless it looks like it is followed in this movie, it looks like a built-in microphone in the camera.
