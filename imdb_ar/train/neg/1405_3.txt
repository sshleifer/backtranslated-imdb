"Girl in Trouble" is certainly not one of the best musical works of Alfred Esther. But even the bad Astaire films have always enjoyed some good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, the American musician star in London on a personal tour. He meets Alice Marschurton (Joan Fontaine, 19), a beautiful English sheikh, who jumps in the back of his taxi to escape a crowd of fans. <br /> <br /> Jerry thinks Alice is being forced to marry her rich aunt. He tries to save her from her family's rural home, but he soon discovers that the staff at the house are placing bets that the lady Alice is marrying. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) co-conspirators, and Albert (Harry Watson), a delightful houseboy, alternately help each other and ruin the love story of Alice's lady with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First, there is the plot, based on the novel P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and full of nerves. When Fred does not dance, we have to endure the unsettling scenes of (a) Fred Roman Juan Fontaine or (B) Kiggs and Albert unite against each other. <br /> <br /> Particularly troublesome. They are evil characters with one dimension, the kind of players you just want to hit in the mouth. I wish they would get out of the screen and let the dance teams. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a weak leading lady in this film, and she is malicious in a musical. She does not have many things you like, unlike her beautiful personality and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are going to ride, as propaganda for Jerry and his well-honed secretary. The duo adds some of the much needed chemistry in this plot, and Grace has some ridiculous lines, but it is sometimes very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film for George Stevens is not good. Sometimes, filming is terrible and unprotected. There are a number of external scenes in the streets of the very foggy, trying to convince the public that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this film.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin were wonderful, and became standards for classical songs. Of course, dancing in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But musical and dance numbers are not used badly and sound. Sometimes, it seems that the cast starts to sing and dance, because it is time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem to be randomly entered into the tortuous plot. (At one stage, the servants step out of the palace house and are divided into a single band for no apparent reason.) Figures include: "I dance and I can not bother now" - Fred dances well on the misty filled London Street. I've had some great Cane Recycling with a rolled umbrella - but the number ends soon when Fred jumps in a double-decker bus. (In Broadway musical "Crazy For You," Harry Groener released a much better version of this figure with a group of Corset girls.) "Put me to the test" - Fred, George, and Gracey With a triple dance in an English hut. George and Gracie have a unique step to step, but the number ends badly as everyone kicks each other for no reason. <br /> <br />  "The Fun House Number" - in a house amusement park, Fred, George and Gracie enjoy dancing on the rotating floor and in the rolling drum and with fun home mirrors. It is the best number of the film, but it is repeated a little at times. <br /> <br />  "Things look higher" - Fred and Gwen Fontaine make their dance numbers together in the film, and move around the backyard of Manor Country. Fortunately, it is a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br /> A "foggy day in the city of London" - Fred walks around Manor's foggy estate at night and talks about a foggy day. When he met Joan for the first time in London. Sometimes, it seems as if he is not sure how he walks in the fog - just like the music number itself. <br /> <br /> "Nice work if you can get it" - a great song misused in the movie. During a social event at Manor's house, Fred is attracted to a group of two-sided singers who sing this song randomly. Every time Fred joins, the other singers look at them as if they want to leave. (Once again, Harry Groener has performed better than dancing with this song in "Crazy For You.") Drum Dance Number - Since Fred and Joan run away, Fred has to stop and perform one final dance while pressing a set of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there is no need for it at all, except prolonging the film. <br /> <br /> The most crowded moment in the film comes when Fred decides to jump off a high stone balcony in the rural estate to prove his love. By Joan Fontaine. While jumping out of the balcony, finding a swing in an appropriate position - this is true, * swing * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stunt man in unique clothes) holds the swing and swings to the ground from him. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves to have a DVD to get the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the man who invented a fast forward button on the remote control. The FF button lets you skip other boring scenes in the movie to access dance numbers.
