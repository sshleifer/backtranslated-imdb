Very outrageous adaptation of the wonderful children's book. The inappropriate and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and the sick side story of a friend of mine who wants to send the boy away to the military school to keep him out of the way makes this quite inappropriate for children who most likely want to see him because of a 3-8 year book Of old. Do not waste your money, your time, or your good judgment.
