I watched this work at a film festival in California. My God, what was the director thinking? Film teachers should use this film as a case study of what should not be done when making a short film. First, this project makes no sense at all. The movie is partially shown in "The Waystation" and is part of a stupid stupid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> Representation is slowly increasing. So bad in fact that I thought it was a comedy. Leading actress Julia Reading is a step less than acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it seems like the director did not have any idea how to work or use hisspians. The only thing worse than acting is dialogue, bordered by futility. The writer (who I assume is the director too) writes every character like they are testing a movie about a wicked comic book. <br /> <br /> The overall output value is very good, but frankly, with a very bad film it's easy to overlook. The production design is very good, although the Waystation is similar to any normal bar. Fashion and makeup is fine, I understand that the production was running with a low budget. It is only when the characters speak, or when they try to push the plot forward, that the film explodes in the mud. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is God-awful. Looks like the director / writer watched a lot of science fiction movies and threw all the parts I loved in the mixer and went out with this. My only hope is that he used the money of others in this matter, because if he uses his own money, he is a sucker.
