I and my friends have hired this from Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nana Visitor in the box. This film is a farce and I hope to deny its autobiography. <br /> <br /> The "plot" had been lost and performed, and the representation was mostly dry and improbable in some parts. The film is meaningless at all. The cruel plot of a type of alien parasite that has struck humans has been made many times by films with much better texts than this, for example, the invasion of body abductors and faculty members. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misfortune that comes across this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How to classify yourself as a horror film when there is no use of fear, suspense, nonsense, terrorism or any of the usual horror movies techniques that I do not know, yet if you still find yourself wanting to watch this movie , I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand, so you can find the funny parts of it.
