I hired this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was a real disappointment, I had terrible clich√©s, and half the film was of naked women called "Fallen Angels" running around trying to behave scary, Charming camera "black and white" charming camera ". Tom's personality was awful, terrible text. You have to love the lines they use. "Is there anyone, from there, this is not funny" I hope I give this flick 0! O names of characters. Jude, Molly, an ally, Emilio, but they left Anthony, Breakfast Club Unification in the jungle of unforgivable acting.
