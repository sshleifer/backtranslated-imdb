The Japanese have always had fantastic ambitions in their fantasy films. They have always been willing to destroy cities with huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they did not get the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on humans. It is very embarrassing and very funny, but very good. After all, we love these creatures and these movies after all, right?
