Cast to die in a film much less. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she goes, she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that has the appearance and expectations of being a great movie simply because they have a lot of great actresses and actresses in it So it seems to be about something other than a potboiler it really is. It's not bad, but with Redgrave, Tony Collett, Glenn Close, Merrill Streep, Clare Danis, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all of them doing great shows) you would expect more than a very exciting story. From the romantic clown. <br /> <br /> Wait for Cable.
