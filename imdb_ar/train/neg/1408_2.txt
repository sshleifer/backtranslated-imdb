I did not expect much from this film, after the terrible "Miracle Life". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I get the impression that the director / writer is joking with the audience: "Let me see how much space the audience can afford." Empty dialogues, ... narrower scenario. In a few moments, photography is really nice. Some parody lines are almost funny, but it's hard to laugh realistically during this "comedy". I laughed at myself because of my ability to watch the film until the end. If you can lift yourself up for this director's failure, you'll find a good representation of some of the legends (Mickey Manuelovich, Alexander Persek), and a very good performance for Prince Stribor's son Costoreka. <br /> <br /> In short: very bad for such a great director! Prince Kusturika is still young and should make high-quality films. Instead, he chose to perform this low-budget drama only, with a haughty attitude from world trends and neglect towards his old fans.
