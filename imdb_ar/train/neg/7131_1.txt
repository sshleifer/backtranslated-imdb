I love bad movies. I like to rent bad films with my friends and practice them for a period of time. Then there are hateful movies like this. Redline is not just a bad film, but it is a sign that the American film industry may have to satisfy, at least for viewers, to correct scripts before financing the film. <br /> <br /> If a kind of stereotype takes crap, this film spawn from it. The story is unbearable, and the representation is everywhere funny. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may be the worst screen chemists I've seen in a long time, and even individually they have to be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges to change their profession to street traders (just about what can legitimately qualify for). Moreover, Angus McFadden's conviction that this film is so far from me that I can not even think of analogy. I admire him, but this made me question him. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. Many people want revenge for various reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you're someone bigger than me), so much so that it turns violent (I think). The film is like Ouroboros, a snake that swallows its tail, because it has an endless loop of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears. This film is a big commercial commercial for the first half, and an action film that is not encrypted for the rest, and must be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find a positive side to this film, and I think it lies in the fact that the credits eventually roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if this is your richness for these songs in this film, you are penetrated, and I hope that old age will ruin you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you are renting this movie for a funny experience, listen to the lyrics of the wonderful songs of Jorlin.
