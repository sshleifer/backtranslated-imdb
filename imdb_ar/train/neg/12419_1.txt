A dirty look at kibbutz life <br /> <br /> This film is not a cultural story about the life of a kibbutz boy, but a deliberate demon of the kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the man in charge of the cows raped one of the calves. And the whole thing out there in terms of characters that represent "typical kibbutznikim". In addition to the two main people, a woman who is morbidly depressed and her youngest son, everyone else in the kibbutz is a blatant caricature of evil. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on how the kibbutz, like a kind of worship, attracts the mother and son slowly into despair and inevitably follows. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Each personality / situation represents a different horrible human vice such as dislike, hypocrisy, violence, racism, oppression, etc. For example, while the protagonist is a handsome handsome European boy of 12 years old? His older brother is a typical kibbutz youth who completes his "Jewish" physical appearance and his brutal character. He cares more than foreign volunteers of his mother's death. He treats these volunteers like garbage. After he appealed to his younger brother to visit his deceased mother, who had not seen her for a long time because of his military service, he ordered, quote ?? "Linda, go and bathe as I cum in two minutes." <br /> <br /> Is there another "good" character in this movie? A European foreigner plays with his mother's girlfriend. When the rapist tries to hit the son of the mother, his friend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is expelled from the kibbutz because of his "violent" behavior against a member of the kibbutz. More hypocrisy: An indescribably annoying French woman playing a school teacher preaches that sex can not happen before the age of 18, or without love and gives a description of the actual act that is supposed to be fun for the public, but it is really just stupid. Of course, it beats the head of the kibbutz in the fields, which in turn eliminates the mother of the young boy when her mental health becomes worse. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the kibbutz as a kind of worship. The children come out of their beds in the middle of the night and are transferred to some rituals where they swear allegiance in the fields supervised by the elders of the kibbutz. It seems that the mother can not "escape" from the kibbutz, although anyone was / in fact always free to come and go as he pleases. It is unclear how the boy's father died, but you can rest assured that the kibbutzim "led him" and his surviving father are another couple of heartless, heartless figures who weigh the mother and son. <br /> <br /> This is the essence of this movie. Characters with one dimension, more than theatrical acting, dry performance, and a deceptive message continue to try to reach itself to the top of the audience ?? That the life of Kibbutz was humiliating, miserable and even fatal to those who "did not correct." I feel sorry for the man who made this film? He obviously had a bad experience that originated in Kibbutz. But I feel as though he has taken some of the facts of the truth about the life of the kibbutz and turned it into large, typical atomic bombs.
