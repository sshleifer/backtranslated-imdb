I'm amazed to discover how many fans like it. Did not say that friends was, at best, a "middle" comic, not as great as others did. Let's face it, if it's not for Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schweimer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Codro, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Planck, who knows if this offer will last as long as it lasts. I doubt so much. Despite the progression of the series, friends became more predictable, lame, and boring, so much so that I could not care much about the personalities - who are the most exaggerated in the history of television - or their plight, nor who slept with whom. And went from funny in the first four chapters to funny sometimes. Even when all these Hollywood actors were from the world of cinema, I did not bother them with interest. Writing in friends became old because I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and until the end, well, it was expected to say the least. <br /> <br /> What was disturbing was that this lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite programs lasted only three or four seasons and were eventually canceled and took off from the air forever. The offer must stop as soon as the staff wants more pay. In fact, as the chain diminished, the show was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When I finished in 2004, I was very relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk about a reunion program coming to our TV screens soon. And yet, I would not look forward to it at all.
