Alien Love (as this film is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I do not mean that it's a Peter Greenaway movie house or Derek Jarman, I mean TVM with swearing, sex, some really good stuff, very bad text, and a very old feeling. You can only imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years ago, although it would of course have cut T & A <br /> <br /> Back to the bad text, one of the problems is that few characters have any kind of motivation especially Amanda. Why pick up Connie at the bar? Just so you can interview a foreigner? Do you see what I mean by reaction? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a host of other films from the mid-eighties of the last century had this kind of plot, where most of them were identified and persuaded more than those we see here. The story continues to follow an unspecified, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> This I said I found ALIEN LOVE viewable and not just down to the T & A displayed. As a scientific sex comedy, it is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS
