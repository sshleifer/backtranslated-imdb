Unfortunately, this film does not credit at all to the original. Nicholas Cage, somewhat wooden as far as the actors go, drinks the screen with a range of skill, from non-sloppy to the top. Support team is not the best. <br /> <br /> The plot remains as it was originally in the evolution of the scene but much worse. Not enough details are given to allow the public access to what is being sold. It turned out it was just an invoice of poor goods. Infidelity can not be suspended, and doubts can not be given. The only aspect that saves this film is that it is very visible, as the method requires, and whoever is exploring the site, should be commended. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and a verbal booing, literally, in the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to appear on the TV, pour the whiskey and enjoy it.
