I was thrilled when I saw the ads of this film because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading the book, I have recently been reintroduced, as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters do not seem to fit well with the book. The trend was weak. You have difficulty getting into characters. There was no real contact with the viewer about what was happening. The dialog box did not adequately explain what was happening. He just looked slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the film. I assume that if you do not read the book, it may be fine in itself. At least, you might be encouraged to read the book, which you might enjoy more. <br /> <br />
