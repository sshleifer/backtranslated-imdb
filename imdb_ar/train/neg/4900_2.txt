SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten more minutes, important, "extreme" shots) here in the UK in the early days of the video boom, and caused a popular storm in a teacup when it inspired the case of fake murder. The odd thing is that the paperwork had made this very disturbing click under the rug in its impulsive rush to get relatively harmless instances of frozen frost and canned devil's night, all of which had been forgotten as a result. I jumped to the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with my jaw on the floor. It is not politically incorrect as much as it is full. The triple X classification on DEATH WISH by Michael Weiner (was this kind of game giving the game away as much as inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some bad violence already thrown out The bubbles of the 1970s are corrupt. If you do not consider yourself too sensitive, it may force you to think again. By the time you finish WISH SEX, you'll want to clean your pinched asses and a long hot shower to cleanse yourself. If any film really deserves a line sign "It's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie", that's the line. <br /> <br /> The most important feature (or light) - a rapist who uses a rocker on a victim while masturbating, Sharp Harry Rimes, who steals the scene, the helpless black couples forced on the cane killer (who won the Oscars for their perfectly reliable performances) If the academy is successful, the man is cast aside for his problems, and some frighteningly cold direction threatens to lift the proceedings above the crumbling craters. Do not say I did not warn you. If you think the world was an innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you are very wrong.
