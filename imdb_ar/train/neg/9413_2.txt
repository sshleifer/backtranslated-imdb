I do not strongly agree with other viewers of this miserable film. The only reason why I did not classify him as very bad is due to the wonderful talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and end are the best parents because of their talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the rest of the image. Alice Fei pays off. Don Ameche has a great lyric, but with the miserable writing material, it is going very hard. <br /> <br /> The plot is very strong here with Ameche who assumes two parts as a song and dance was not happily married by Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that by playing the song and dancing, Ameche's marriage gets a second change to re-ignite it. Some silly nonsense about the Baron's having to liquidate the business and being abroad allows him to play both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal gives little to do here, so his comedy goals do not give him the chance to shine. As previously stated by J. Carrol Naish who actually seems uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> It's Chika Chin Bomb's bomb in a movie.
