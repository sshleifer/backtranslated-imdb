It should not be confused with the film above the medium "The Sentinel Movie". The guard was a great embodiment of the film to me, and did not offer the consistent work, promised some critics on the back. To me it seemed like everyone was half, and there was only to earn some quick cash, because it looked like a TV movie. The Sentinel is a rewriting of several better films, such as "In The Line of Fire", this has no authenticity in it, watching Michael Douglas spin around, I felt naive silly in my opinion. The main problem, besides its non-existence, must be the weak pace. You are often distracted while trying to watch this movie, while looking at the remaining run time, more than once. Not only was the misunderstanding with Eva Longoria, who could not convince her of the value of licking. <br /> <br /> Shows. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable representative, obviously passing through the movements. He is not convinced as a runaway man, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Basinger was also stalled. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but it's fine here, nothing more. He tries to catch him as a shaker, but he manages to be more wonderful and then anything else, and to be honest, he does not seem interested in it. Eva Longoria Parker is fairly mediocre. She does not convince her role, and was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is as terrible as the First Lady. She seems bored to tears, and her role is to throw away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big role in the end, but not enough for me. <br /> <br /> The bottom line. The guard is, after another political excitation film, it made me cry. It is very old, very tired, and most importantly, the effort is not absorbed. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
