> Warn that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. The great direction was the well thought out shots. The actors were very good especially Richard Pryor, I wanted to see more of it. Madeleine Khan and John Housman were classic. Dudley peace be upon him more could have done better. John Ritter Again I wanted to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the author's failure. The product might have pulled the plug once it saw what it was doing. It is very bad that a lot of money went to this boiler, when there is a slight change here and there in my opinion repaired. Must have paid the standard prices for the book. To produce a single chuckle.
