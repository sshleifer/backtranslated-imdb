This movie is awesome. Not offensive but very predictable. The film follows the life of a small town family in the mid-1960s. The father, the principal, is in midlife. Enter a beautiful teacher from the big city that begins challenging the minds of her students with some thought-provoking things, like thinking for yourself. The manager does not agree with her education but she is pretty. You can connect points. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder and Winaby Tara Frederick) is fed up with a small city lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and it seems that family planning has not been taught at her school. shocking! When you see that director Paul Shapiro has worked primarily on television, this film plays as a version of a post-school adult or a very special episode of one of the usual sitcoms.
