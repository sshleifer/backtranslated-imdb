This is the perfect film "Perfect Crime". The perfect offense is performed and knows the investigating officer who ignores all the clues immediately who is the culprit. The audience must wait around the entire film until it is captured. The result is like every single episode of "Colombo" or "Murder I wrote". The director himself refers to Hackney's story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills 90 minutes but the director insists on using every 120 minutes filling with all the cliches in the book. Skip this one, you do not miss anything.
