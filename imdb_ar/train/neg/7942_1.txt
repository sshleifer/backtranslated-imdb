really. Does Opera remind us every week that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> She makes herself the focus of every interview. <br /> <br /> Opera can not resist commenting on each question you ask. Often the guests are interrupted before the answer is completed to intervene aside or tale. It is clear that managers have been instructed to focus on their close reaction rather than the guest's face because that's what matters - what Oprah feels, or what Oprah says. Opera, Opera, Opera. It's always about opera. <br /> <br /> Oprah - I feel sorry for myself, I was very poor. I feel the pain of my fight with my weight. I feel pain when I'm away from a fancy shop after it's already closed. Feel good to buy magazines and books. I feel good for my success. Feel good when I give to a charity make me look good. I am satisfied that I am rich beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Explain to her point of view: You are all severely flawed and need daily advice. I have all the answers to your life even though I do not have anything in common with you. I never married and I do not want to be. I never had to raise a family - but I know everything about her. I have little respect for men or marriage. Obviously I'm better than others - see "Legends Ball 2006". Gail is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> On 7/31/2006, the title on her website says: "Oprah.com is the main source for information about love, self-life, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." How presumptuous and obnoxious is this? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, two private wedding parties in Oklahoma crashed to collect footage in September 2006. They herald the promise of withdrawal from television but her small festival continues unending. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what you think, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor a personal mission of God. She is just a very lucky black woman, overweight, who copied Phil Donahue's style and described it herself. I came across the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to absorb the correct demography. <br /> <br /> Opera is a P.T. Parnom of this age and this amazes me that people can not see through their faces. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you are also an opera if you can fit this oversized ego through the door - this way now to the big exit ...
