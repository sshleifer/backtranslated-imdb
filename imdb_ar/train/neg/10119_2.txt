The animations in re-imagining Peter & the Wolf are wonderful, but in 29 minutes, the film stimulated sleep. They should have called it "Peter and Snail", because everything moves at the snail's pace. I could not even watch the movie in one session - I had to watch it for 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and you'll thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee saw only the first few minutes of the candidates. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the best short moving film category (short!), Voters will have to participate in everything. I have already felt sorry for them - and I have to expect that there is no way this film is about to win.
