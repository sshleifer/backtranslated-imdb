We can start with wooden representation but this film is a disaster. After growing up in New York, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. I'm not even an advocate of culture in any way, and I found this piece of Hollywood from the trash to suit its fantastical display of culture and language that anyone knows Seinfeld thinks is inaccurate. This is a huge waste of time, and worse, not quite interesting because the result is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are very bad. Who acts this way? no one. <br /> <br /> The author's name seems Israeli or something like that, but he obviously has no idea what he is writing about. Looking at his autobiography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wonders how true his association with society is. Even modest films such as "Strange Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this drowning. When reading the credits of this man, it is no wonder that he wrote texts on all C movies that show the stars one way or another. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this scenario is less than the bad film Dolph Lundgren.
