I thought the full humor of the film was seeing a rich white person acting like Chris Rock, and then I see Chris Rock interacting with people's reactions. Instead, Chris Rock sees only himself and is not understood by people. There may be 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use a gimmick. This should have been much better.
