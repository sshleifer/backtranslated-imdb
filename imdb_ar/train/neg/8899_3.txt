Where is it written that the sequel sucks? 2 did not scream! Others did not! But this problem certainly ... includes the terrible actors problems (only Christopher and Alan can act in the entire movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on, and I've even done a research on the idea of ​​Nivelim previously) terrible options for casting. Eric Roberts makes the dumbest Archangel Michael that I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a plague unless you are desperate to see Christopher Wacken. In this case, quickly navigate to the parts that are in the movie, and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
