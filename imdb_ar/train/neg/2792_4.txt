STUDIO 666 (also known as THE THE PROPESSED in the UK) is another sub-standard actor with a live movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> While many DVD movies to DVD are fast paced or hilariously unintentionally in the very bad sense, STUDIO 666 failed. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, each comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (at the time of writing this report) who wrote the reviews should not be taken seriously by 10 out of 10. Obviously, they saw a few vulgar movies and a limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only positive point I can make about this film is that it is much better than suffocation and one of them. , Two very weak and I do not want my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie must have been performed hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight twist (one being handled badly) according to the usual expectations. A melancholy singer commits suicide. Soon after, her spirit returns to having one of her surviving friends. A friend of mine goes in a killing spree. The rest of the plot is really very strange to summarize. You will only have to see for yourself, since your interest has not, of course, declined to the point of extinction. <br /> <br /> The acting in the film is very bad for the most part. The actress who played a role was an exception. Her character was always interesting and tempting when she was on screen. It helps to raise the film above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines I was given were written to say badly to put them in a mild form and thus prevent them from saving the movie. <br /> <br /> The trend was bad. The bad guys do not seem less threatening. Every murder was completely free of suspense or tension. The atmosphere did not exist, and the camera's work was incredibly basic. She reminded me of some special effects (if you can contact her) in the TV series, GHOST Stories. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES cleverly wrote texts and reliable presentations and excellently benefited from camera angles. Perhaps if the producers watched the television series closely, they might have picked up some techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is completely inappropriate for the movie's sound. It's just rock music and not the best examples of it. Do not let me start that awful song that was initially played! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the movie up (or should be down) to a very bad, good level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a modest average grade, with very few noteworthy areas. I recommend this only to those who are lovers of movies directly to the DVD and have a desire to see every slasher one ever has.
