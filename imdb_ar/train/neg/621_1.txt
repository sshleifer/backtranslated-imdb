Holy @ #% & This film was still warm and sparkling from the lint it made. I tried to watch this crumbling heap of waste, but I found it easier to smash my wrists and stop the shooter from Lysol floor cleaner instead of carrying more than half the crap she had on my screen. I put this in a much lower order than anything I've ever seen in a movie or television, and that's something to say. I once saw a cow in a field. I saw the steam pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... maybe you moved or something. Well, I've had a better time watching this trip. There was no representation, the plot was elsewhere than the film. I think I saw absolutely discovered early as the plot managed to escape and was in the background on the back of an old pick-up truck heading for Portland hoping to become the Steven King's shi77er. Please tell me that the manager gets the medication he needs most. It obviously needs heavy drugs and I want to pay the money needed to reverse the lobectomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the full punch it needs because nothing can ever do this painfully in a written word alone. Let me say that if you are looking for a click to spend some time and see this Chilton on the shelf, walk into your car and start running the engine, then push both of your hands straight into the fan so you do not feel your bones shaking anymore. Make sure you own your purse in your hand too because you will lose money anyway. You may also have the privilege of wasting it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this after I sent my friend my girlfriend to his girlfriend so I could see him. It's over, it's over. What's worse is that she had to watch this thing that is% & @ thing twice! I have heard of married couples now and get to visit his balls once a month. I hope it is because of this film.
