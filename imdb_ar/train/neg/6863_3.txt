Oh my God, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The final sequence is processed again very effectively and was very hilarious. That's what you get these three points. Otherwise, it was terrible. This was not meant to be funny, that much is obvious, but dubbing, the representation of dubbed voices, the dialogue they said, where it is often hilarious. Actions that are performed and / or not performed also lead to a lot of cheer and / or throwing objects on the screen. Such as when the whole city is slaughtered and a small group of people standing on a balcony looking at them as if they were watching a glass of cooking, or "trying" to evade the church in which they were flitting. <br /> The Evil Mayor: I think there's something going on outside, so you have to climb up to the top floor and look for the window. Hero: Well. <br /> <br /> The villainous mayor: Now is an opportunity to make some idiots go abroad and flocking with fire because they are completely ineffective and are being hacked. <br /> <br /> Enter a sequence where this happens. <br /> <br /> The villainous mayor: Damn, wait, I'll get this little kid and walk out and cry apparently angry at the fact that these rotten bodies are not just nervous strangers but actually zombies without body or skin or Anything, you will drive them away and I will run away! Enter a sequence where this occurs. <br /> <br /> Hero (upstairs): Trying to escape again, you idiot, he left the door open, it's ridiculous, it's a beautiful view. <br /> <br /> Woman: Where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> The hero (in the basement now): I do not know, I can not see her anyway and she was not outside because I could not see her even though she was out there and I looked at the entire neighborhood and she was standing directly outside, Where can it be on Earth? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, anyone would throw things on the screen after 10 minutes of this. So, watch the first movie with two friends, eat some drinks, and make sure that by the time you watch this movie, you are completely blind drunk and can laugh at everything stupid. There was not even decent gore, such a shame.
