As a fan of a notorious reputation, I was looking forward to this film. I'm sorry to see him as a terrible film. The beauty of Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray the "notorious" follows a lot of the real son's story of notorious reputation, Christopher Jordan Wallace in the role of notorious. As a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to honor his father. Derek Locke is not quite as convincing as Shawn's "swollen" combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play his roles here. The big problem with this is that these are the real people who are playing. It was boring and did not provide any information about Notorious B.I.G. That fans and non-fans alike did not already know. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Basset, the very good actress who was wasted here as Wallace Cavalita. Molluscs and film dresses along thinking that the notorious B.I.G. Fans will spend a lot of money on it. I am sorry to say that this has happened. It's close to a good movie. I was expecting so much, but unfortunately I did not get anything I wanted from this. I think you should definitely skip this.
