This movie was not too terrible, but it was so bad. The acting was actually very good! Jeffrey combs has done a very good job like crazy world, which is kind of his specialty if you do not know such things: D. Forsythe bill .. Well, I'm not exactly sure why it was in this movie. It is very good for these nice things, and his role was not fully required. I hired this on the strength of these two threads, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's about half a man / half a penny. It's not people Shakespeare. Unlike the plot, full of holes, and poor dialogue, I would like to point out that cinema has left as many things as required. There were shots when they tried to look "cool", but it ended up blocking the scene or just appearing. They also blew it up several times when they had a decent dialogue and were cut off prematurely before the person could connect the line. It was very bad. But if you are a fan of Jeffrey combs, this game is worth checking out. He gives a wonderful performance and does what he can with his character. forsythe not too bad, either it is female bullets. Check if I can remember her name though. Bottom line, I will not waste your time.
