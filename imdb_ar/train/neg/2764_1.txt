First, I have no idea how this movie reaches the big screen. It's not even the low-budget SCI-Fi movie, it's just awful. I and my friend who love Motion Movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to watch this movie and they expect me to have this movie Transformers with dragons and reckless entertainment. All we got was an hour and a half mindless. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot was extremely awful besides acting, I was compensated. It's basically the Chinese legs of the returning dragon every 500 years ... looks like a good remake of fire rain? No, the plot is trying to be deeper than you should leave not only the holes of the plot, but with magic, a very small real war between the dragons (fairly large snakes) become ridiculous. The director tried to add a little humor to the failed film. My friend and I laughed over everything (along with all five attendees), and I could not believe we spent money on it. The short trailer on TV compensates most of the activity while the waste is the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say if you want to laugh nonstop for an hour, watch this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink alcohol ... but it would help before watching this movie
