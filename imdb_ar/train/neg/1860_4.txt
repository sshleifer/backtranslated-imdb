The comedy Michael Keaton kiddie of the same title was strongly condemned in 1998 for its own poor effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George has written for this horror comedy that they are positive. The killer snow appears to be made of Styrofoam and its arms appear to be large oven-sized gloves. Which they probably were. The actors highlight this in a parody of dozens of other films (much worse) and Paul Keith, as the town doctor is not particularly forgotten in a small but hilarious role.
