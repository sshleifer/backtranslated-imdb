I remember that this show was on TV when I was a kid in the early 1990s, and there was this anger about the children in clothed clothes doing kung fu on each other and wandering around plastic dinosaurs. It was called Power Rangers. I remember that young children would walk around beating each other and then the shirts and materials of the show were banned in many educational districts throughout the country because this presentation taught children how to fight each other in solving their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of this as a show, especially when the best shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teenagers have always looked at power guards in a silly and crowded way, and it's not hard to ask why. The shots are silly at best. Fashion colored guards look like the things you will do, and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then enter into acting, of course that story really laughable poetry. All the men running with earrings, half of them in 90's, always wearing the same clothes every day, then turning into a jute wearing power guards. <br /> <br /> Games are also particularly silly, and many late night pranksters. Of course, two of the worst films ever produced, that is to say, two of the worst films ever produced were based on this show, with almost every film critic making films and performances. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is nothing more than a bad TV marketing because of the promotion of a particularly bad game. As an adult, I do not look at him eagerly, but as another embarrassment of children's shows and fashion and men's earrings in the nineties.
