It's not just a bad film; not only that four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers in this film; not only that the script is very bad. It's just ... this movie sucks ... great time. This people are wasting money in awesome texts. It is supposed to criticize Mexican society, but we are fed up with this type of film. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I do not understand that. Mexican cinema faces a big problem if this type of film continues to play (and is written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please, do not think this kind of film has received well in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
