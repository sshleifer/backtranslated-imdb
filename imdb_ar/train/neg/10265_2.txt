Kirstie Alley, who looks a bit more agile, but just a little bit, is in this mess with a man like MacGuyver, blond and bleached hair and everything. The premise of the film revolves around an older woman (50 !!!) who can not produce her script because of age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew to appear as a writer. It is not an original idea and it is not a very good film with bad representation, crazy dialogue and absurd conspiracy. There is another plot about the writer who is crushed or admired by Kirsty and why this puzzle is included. The actor who portrayed Kirsty's brother was very harsh and tortured to watch their scenes. What can be said about this film. avoid it.
