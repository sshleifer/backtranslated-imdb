When my child asks me to leave the premiere of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to claw my eyes. I wanted to get through the screen and slap Mike Myers to sacrifice the last ambiance of his dignity. This is one of the few films in my life that I saw and I immediately wished "not to see", if possible. Other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both of which are better than those in the hat. <br /> <br /> I may drink myself to sleep tonight trying in vain to forget that I saw this blasphemy on the name of the good Seuss. <br /> <br /> For Mike Myers, I say sticks with Austin or even Revive Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, does not mean that Suss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
