Iowa wants to be a "holocaust for the dream" for the Midwest approach, but it appears in the form of the difficult R rating "Reefer Madness." <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, methane is terribly harmful, as addiction and how it destroys people, families and communities. But those characters who are either dumb or silly and the eye rolling scheme will not teach this lesson to anyone. <br /> <br /> While the writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on the screen, his partner Dianne Foster plays a nasty and ridiculous role in innocent eyes damaged by drugs, and has already been upset by Susan Sarandon in The Rocky Horror I really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity I was exposed to.It was not until the end of the film that I realized that I was supposed to think that these two were graduating in high school to explain some of their naivet√©, as we bombed pictures Their school, however, if so, they have looked older people on the "OC." While they have good chemistry On the screen, it is a pale imitation of a couple of "Badlands." <br /> <br /> Michael T. Weiss, who was good at The Pretender on television, is quite ridiculous as a parole officer And his brutal violence is just ordinary madness, because his personality greatly destroys any social significance of the film.Rosanna Arquit should be quieter than David Cronenberg was about as a very low rent for Livia Soprano. I did it but this is worse. The Goth chick appears, with the curious explanation that she is a stripper from Des Moines. Shows a mandatory Latin drug dealer - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the internal view of methyl use is displayed very clearly, with very scary hallucinations. We certainly see them make fun. <br /> <br /> While the locations of Iowa are used very well (including an armed scene to steal propane gas), the dialects and references of the church are a confusing Southern Baptist. Weapons seem to be used more by law-abiding people and violators here than any other drug film inside the city. <br /> <br /> The songs of Jared Brown, which Iowa is famous for all over the city, are used, but strangely it is not included in the credits. I hope they have been used with permission. <br /> <br /> This caught on in New York City because I missed him at the Tribeca Film Festival where I got a big and inexplicable buzz.
