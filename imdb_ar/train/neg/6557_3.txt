Indeed, they have clearly spelled out the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> Well, they did not have a budget for the spelling checker. All the production money went to the wonderful old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is Darren's conversion. A yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> Movie studio shows that there are some money spent on fashion and group decorations. The old cameras, an exterior image of Ciro, were street signs and anything was necessary to make a visually pleasing image. Written and badly directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it works for about 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. It ended without a result. There was a collision but no result. The film only broke against credits. 99 cents for this purpose. I paid 99 cents for this. I could buy 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat's face feel more excited. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in the Cerro scene after Darren McGavan received a phone call, it seemed so. .. This film will have a sudden twist that would make for an interesting film. Then I sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor played by Stephen Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have played a bigger role in everything that was happening here. This actor could have made a good film. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut off part of Brian and use Stephen Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and band loss and add the Johnny Otis voice to both the band and then they got something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
