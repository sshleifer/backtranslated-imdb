I feel like I just watched a movie sniff .... something beautiful, taut, interesting and gorgeous! A set of two hours of distortion in the basic sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, beheading, incest, corruption, live burial, ill-treatment, ill-treatment and abuse. No redemption at all. I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this kind of thing, and a world that has become so real that real snuff films will eventually be the norm. I'm not a hardcore or a humorist, I do not try to hide the existence of darkness, I certainly did not live a protected life, but I feel ashamed of myself. I am sorry to see my British cousins ​​pulling away the objective sewage as my tribe does. It does not have to be warm, but should it indulge in alternative sadism?
