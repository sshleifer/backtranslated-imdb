I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so hard on the dollar that he was ashamed of such a shocking shock in this brutality. Hell: I will donate the money that I would have sent to Ethiopia if it was hopeless. I have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... Who paid for this? They either pull out some tax fraud or crazy. The 5-year-old will be ashamed of the plot, and the best cancer will be in place of sitting for more than an hour already suffering. All participants must be held for one year in the homosexuality wing of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I give it minus 10 if possible ... incredible.
