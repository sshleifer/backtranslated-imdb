Well, it's not the best movie I have ever seen, but at the same time I was able to see it and watch it twice !!! The storyline was very shocking, and I wondered during the first part of the first short story about the hell I was watching, but at the same time it was so bad, I loved it and it laughed along the way. <br /> <br /> Japedia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing he took was halfway there where he stopped calling his mysterious name. <br /> <br /> The film was generally very nice but if he laughs then cheaply he sees it in the land of the pound you go.
