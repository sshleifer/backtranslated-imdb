Before I go, I must admit that he is a big fan of Bon Jovi. Actually this is what attracted me to the DVD issue in the first place. Maybe I would buy it anyway, being a big fan of horror and I enjoyed the title of the first vampire. <br /> <br /> But this is not good. Even John can not save this film for me. My main problem is that it simply is not scary. Regardless of the character of John Derek Bliss, none of the other characters have any impression and you can not care less whether they die or not, especially a vampire / drug addict woman. Female vampire simply is not scary or sexy. Instead she looks like a 14-year-old girl, and no wonder she is too desperate for blood. Another big problem is that everything is "very bright". There is no atmosphere or feeling of awe. I know that the first two vampires hired in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of crawling, but they can still be dark and emerging when needed. This film is not like tension. <br /> <br /> The story is the same as before. The vampire wants the Bezier cross to be able to walk in broad daylight. However, the story is less spectacular this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of every master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do not care who or what this is. There is no army for the masters. Instead, you hide in some old ruin that looks pretty much like Disneyland then a creepy temple. <br /> <br /> So, there really is. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. A real let me down personally.
