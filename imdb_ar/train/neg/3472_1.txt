James Gandolfini is a good representative, what he did at any given time in this part of the deceptive garbage. Affleck is just a lightweight he can not cut, and the rest of the cast is not really forgotten. I saw this in the USA in an empty theater, and soon I knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I came out before the end It was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I came back to England I saw that the film had a glowing report from Yoyo "Paul Ross" on a Sunday in the market. I always rely on Ross to save money on movie tickets. If he says the film is good, I get this particular site to see it. This movie should go directly to the Â£ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
