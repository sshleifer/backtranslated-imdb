The film looked like a good idea: 9 people face their fears of winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, the film did not turn into a good movie. There are many scenes too long and useless like a dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to guide the camera to female body parts. The acting is bad, but some lines are amusing in their horrors. The strange thing is that at the end of the film, it turns into a western form of 5 minutes, and eventually, the touches, several of which, do not seem logical with the rest of the film. It was as if the director had just added things because he thought he would look great while comfortably ignoring the film's plot until that point. It just did not make much sense. The only terrible thing is that older people dance in the hall, but this does not even come close to compensating the rest of this mess.
