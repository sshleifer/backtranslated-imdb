Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (I love the brass eye and the blue jam). This is very much like a student film is not so bad. What interests me, in all this is why BAFTA won ??? Maurice makes fun of "ruthlessness" (Ayn Rand) in most of his work (Nathan Barley) and with this piece urinates on the appearance of the talented and tell us raining! <br /> <br /> I hope only because he chose a subject I would like to address (the humanity of terrorism - four blacks) and that he would not get away with it, wasting an opportunity to make a statement about the farce of ignorance and prevailing opinion in these highly emotional and woven phenomena.
