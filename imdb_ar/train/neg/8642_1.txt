I must say that this is a terrible film, because once you watch this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary film. When I saw that, I began to laugh, thinking to myself, does this man really expect me to believe that this is true? So I had to look for it, and now I see it as a movie, but now that it is not a documentary, it is now a badly represented film. So, in both cases, is very bad. I actually did not reach the end. I had to close it. I'm a police officer in New York City and I felt that someone was trying to mislead people into believing that this was a documentary film, with the intention of making money on a terrible day for me and my colleagues at work. So, I took it a little personally. Maybe blind it, which is not as bad as I personally think. Everyone has their own opinion.
