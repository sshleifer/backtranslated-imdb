It was a painful experience, the entire story already exists, so I will not go into it, but the acting was terrible, as there was this part at first when the brother went to work and was actually wearing a white coat at home before he left for work, Acute biological materials means that you have to wear sterile clothes in a controlled environment. The laboratory itself looks like a school lab. This screen is on top of a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene. To make the place look technical and a scientist actually has breakfast in the laboratory. With a biological mark and a hand Rh boss does not tell him anything about it ... not to mention the bad act very bad can not be worse than my advice not I watch and I think that nothing can be worse than the home of the dead, and it seems that the movies Uwi Boll resemble the classic Shakespeare compared to this!
