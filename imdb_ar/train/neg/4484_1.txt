As soon as I started to see the posters and hear talking about this film, I was immediately excited. The matrix was amazing, and I could not wait to see the second, especially after starting to watch their own trailers in other movies. However, when I saw him, I left the theater very disappointed, as did many filmgoers in the theater. While the motion scenes in the film were amazing as always, there were very few of them. In the first film, there was constant fighting appears, but the second took a clearer (and very regrettable) view. To sum up the plot, there was not much that was not expected. The machines were digging in the direction of Zion with the intention of destroying them (this is not a spoiler, as everyone has seen in commercials). The interview was quite shocking. Unless you are a psychologist, it is likely that you will not understand most of what is being said in the film, because of this simply will not care. Has become a somewhat romantic film with a presentation of the events that occur in the life of Neo and Trinity and their relationship. It seems that client Smith, who was so bad as he was in his first film, feels the word and preaching. Personally I do not need to hear it or pay money to listen to it. The film was a serious waste of my time, and I do not think I can watch the first film anymore. The boring and persistent dialogue and monologues of each character basically made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the few good scenes of fighting drove me closer to the edge. The end of the film immediately pushed me. What is the film that ends with "To Be And Done"? How original is that people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers burned midnight oil to reach this oil. In conclusion, the film was bad and this is its end.
