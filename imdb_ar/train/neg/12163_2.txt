The film is completely rotten and has no high quality. Camp Counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson, acting like a murderer, contending when people are wasted so as not to laugh) is on the path of a war that slaughters adolescents who at least act as chakras or resist their pleadings for good behavior. We run a series of vulgar vulgar murders such as cutting the throat for one child looking for Freddy's claw glove, a kid getting a chainsaw, one girl being drilled, a girl pouring into the crust (full of leeks), the person being roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> He has no original idea to offer and is just a waste of time. This is unless you want to see the breasts of Valerie Hartman (who plays the role of a slut ally). Most violence occurs outside the screen, so it will not satisfy.
