Can any film become more naive than this? You can not believe a piece of this script. Predictable ssooooo that you can learn the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. The leading actress looks like she wants to be Barbie (but she does not, Doll has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease with which a character goes and stays in a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. I will not even comment on the vulgarity of the characters, but the only good thing about the film is Madsen's performance, which succeeds in bringing life back to a one-dimensional character like Milo. <br /> <br /> The film is very cheesy as it sticks to your teeth. I can think of some 13-year-old girls and Britney Indians shouting, "Oh, do not give us a break! If we want fairy tales, there's always the book of the Brothers Grimm hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave it 2 instead of just one for Virginia Madsen.
