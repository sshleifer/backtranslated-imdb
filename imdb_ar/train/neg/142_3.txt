First, there are some good things about this movie, but everything is cliches slanted along with a teen movie. In announcing this film, which I saw, there was a great focus on the fact that Dennis Richards is present in it, but she is a poor actress, not as good-looking as people try to make her out (not this) that has anything to do with the film). What is this view that you give to everyone? Maybe it is part of the character, but as I said, acting ... However, the writing is good. You know who is everything in the movie, and you can hardly predict what will happen, but not in an annoying way. I think the book on which it is based is probably good, according to the drawing line, but next time I will read the book to discover this instead of watching it.
