"A Tough Winter", which contains a timetable for the release of "Our Gang" in 1929-30, contains two stories. First, Weiser and Mary Ann, who were alone on a winter day, decided to make some candy. Little Wheezer moves to Mary Ann from the wireless cooking show. Problem: Wheezer transfers information from different programs and ends Mary Ann by putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the gang appears to pull candy - and ends up getting it all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second scenario deals with the story of Stephen Fetchit, an ingenious neighbor in the gang, and his interactions with Gang. <br /> <br /> "Hard winter", to my knowledge, has never been shown on the TV, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the characterization of Stepin Fetchit, which shows a clever, malicious and slow-moving personality. "Our Gang", Hal Roach, Fetchit was described as a "comedian comedian" and used "Our Gang" as a pilot in a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light. It is understood that the Fetchit characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film was delayed. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny moments with Fetchit and Taffy, "A Tough Winter" is a thrilling twist. If a positive result emerges, Hull Studios will become confident and experienced in making dialogues. Sound in the film is good, and some sound effects used very funny. For this reason, this film paved the way for the films of our "Gang" extended from 1930 until the year. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
