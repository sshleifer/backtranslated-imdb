Ivan Retman is a savior. The most weary plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come alive in his skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a fairly original plot (the man unloads the superheroes, the superheroes take revenge on the superpowers) and turn them into something fun. "Friendly" is an exercise in tampering. The pony plot of one trick is long in age after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it is a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film flops between the two, with no good side. Uma Thurman is the vertices, as usual, and Luke Wilson casts his role too, though his tired instincts soon tire. The most insane thing is that in some scenes (for example, when Uma knocks hard on the front panel through the wall), you feel that Reitman is witty and noisy screaming practically screaming at the exit. But seconds later, the magic was lost, and soon the hero, whose films were almost hopeless, went almost every way.
