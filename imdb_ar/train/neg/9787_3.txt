... but the problem with this production is that it is far from good music. <br /> <br /> Granted, one can not always expect prominent masters such as Sondheim, Bernstein or Porter; however, the music of this piece makes Andrew Lloyd Webber seem brilliant. It is deadly and boring (except for one or two) and having only seen it, I could not remember one important tune - a rather tragic one coming from a person learning hundreds of other people from three hearings. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to be a playwright. It happens at an incredibly large stage (one must feel sorry for those people facing front rows who have broken their necks to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and does nothing at all. When there's supposed to be one person singing on stage, that's exactly what you get - and the rest of the enormous stage is empty. For me, as an aspiring stage director, it was painful to see him. <br /> <br /> The truth remains that Cole Porter seems to have acquired French culture in his works better than those talents that can not be approached. I am puzzled by the popularity of this legendary potential musician.
