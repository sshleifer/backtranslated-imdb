I will remain brief, as I know I do not need to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a weird little movie that impresses some people clearly, but I found it pretty cute almost the beginning. The film did little to make any of the characters gracious and sometimes the story became so complex that I lost interest altogether. As I said, I know others have enjoyed it, but I found that Kitamura's Kitive book is nothing but a very boring lame drama disguised as science fiction. I felt as if I was satisfied with watching this film, based on his wonderful hypothesis and the art of his exciting cover. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Try it out in the effort of the most popular Kitamura student "Versus" or the 2004 riots "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... Do not get me wrong, I'm always on a good-thinking man, but that's definitely not the case. There was a rare moment in which I really cared about one event happening in this lively and dialogue-filled film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boredom.
