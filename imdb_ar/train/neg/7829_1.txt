The early 1990s brought many independent films, "exotic" and "immature," and this sub-genre is the semi-spiritual desert crime film. Others of the note are "wild at heart", "from dusk without tel", and to some extent "natural born killers". Good films such as those like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns On The Radio", and this insufficient surrealist masterpiece "Defy the Moon." It's a comedy that aims at a certain emotional tone, reaches it, but continues to go unnoticed. While the pursuit of the world spirit from the desert and the casting of Chris Ben are good ideas, the film is not dirty or hard enough to be a good crime film, and does not focus on laughter to be a comedy. I will not beat the end, but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of type cancer. This is the buzz of indie mania.
