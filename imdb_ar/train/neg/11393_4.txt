Wow, I can not believe that people consider this movie "good". I've seen far worse now, but there are more romantic / funny comedies with John Kozak. <br /> <br /> It's a modest film at best. While acting was not terrible, but it is not wonderful, for a romantic comedy, there was little emotion and romance. There were many loose endings that did not appear or were not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters bear fruit like a complete coward. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not like the people they work with. How do you know they are not in love? Because of the total lack of remorse for each of the characters to leave their money. I can think of some of the more romantic things than the constant escape from the commitment of these two shows. <br /> <br /> The movie does not even finish with a wedding scene, most likely will get both cool feet and drop each other like hot potatoes as soon as the commitment approaches. This film revolves around two people who can not commit to anything, unlike the former Kozak characters, and were more willing to make a deep commitment (Lloyd in Say Anything, Martin at Gross Point Blanc, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure in this film was the total lack of transformations, or anything that mattered. When the film ended, I felt like they had failed to include the climax of the story, which fit the entire film mainly: boring. Do not doubt whether the two will end together, no joy when they do, no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are too blind to shake this film, so much so that they simply scold any criticism with "everyone is very cynical!". Criticizing this film is not ironic, just an unbiased examination. There are many best romantic comedy films, even those with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Resolution, Preserving Faith, Acting, Rear Window, North By North Western, or something about Mary (which is a good test of perfect romance versus today's society).
