A young scientist tries to keep his dead father working on renewing the parties. His tyrant mother convinced him that he had killed his father as he watched his advance for her evil purposes. The young doctor uses the creeping DNA he extracts from a large group. And when his arm ripped comfortably after a few minutes, he was pumping himself into shape and growing a new killer arm ... The special effects in Severed Ties are recognized as good and attractive, but the rest of the film is terrible. The broken arm behaves like a snake and kills a few people. The big deal. The representation is unassuming and the peak ridiculous.
