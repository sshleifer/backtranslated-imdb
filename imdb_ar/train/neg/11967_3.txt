Given the risk of showing homosexuality before the late 1980s, Personal Best could have played a better relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as more than just a trial phase of Cahill's life. </ p> <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators in this film threw a gay relationship between two women attracted to some extent in order to attract viewers. Also consider 90 seconds of uncovering the crutches of many women who jumped back over the high jump pole. This random scene was of great importance to the film and this seems to have been just to keep the audience interested in this nice film. I suppose the producers were trying to confront the boring plot and the most boring settings of the film (the 1980 Oregon competition). <br /> <br /> This review may seem harsh, but it is the truth. The exploitation of Muriel Hemingway's young body and homosexuality destroyed any credit I would give to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
