What "noise" fails to do is make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays the role of the obsessed New Yorker who can not handle the noisy noise of the city anymore, especially the car alarms. It is a strange idea for a film with creative credibility such as "the will of death". It is intelligent at points; especially the scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel, "I am so stupid that I do not understand this." Read and read a paragraph in confusion of our order, we read it and do not get it too. Throughout the film is a constant interference of alarms and city noise. Yet, in general, it does not help us to understand our hero, who allows this to destroy his marriage and to dissipate with side plots instead of digging deeper into his personality. <br /> <br /> The film industry itself is very oblivious to its vocal problems, poor editing, and visual prosperity. No, the "noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not fall. Overall it leads to a home logistics point, one you probably have not thought of. At least I did not. Although all in all, for ninety minutes, it could not have ended sooner. The story continued and seemed lost as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> This is another of those films you might see at a film festival, but it may not be picked up for distribution. Check it on the DVD if you are part of a person involved in the project. Skip otherwise.
