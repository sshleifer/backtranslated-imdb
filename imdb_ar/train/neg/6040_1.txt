From where to start, this film started badly and ended badly! It's made up of very bad and unrealistic effects that made me swing in my seat, seriously, my cat could have done better than this group. <br /> <br /> Some of them were laughable because it was unbelievable, I would rate this less but they did not get anything else! So, listen to my warning and if you are not bored about your approach to suicide and want a good reason to continue your suicide mission, do not care about that. I am still in shock because this can actually be published to the public, and this must be a crime and all concerned must be arrested. I've collected that you got the core now, so I'll leave it to you.
