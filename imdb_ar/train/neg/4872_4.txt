The production line set of fart jokes that claims "Babe" has never been offered. Obviously the writers were hoping that a gimmick to see the talking animals would be enough to keep the film going. it's not. Eddie Murphy again sells as a doctor rediscovering his forgotten talent in childhood to understand the constant chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, mice, dogs and pigeons. The cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Cavner, Renee Santoni, John Ligismo, Gary Shandling, Elaine De Guinars, Paul Robbins, Brian Doyle-Murray). But the scenario is unimaginable, and the feeling of distress and depression is very short.
