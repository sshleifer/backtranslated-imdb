I loved the first part, the impossible planet, but yell, what a disappointment the second part is "Pit Devil". It was a cliffhanger for something that looked up from the hole - nothing came out of the hole. Then the ages spent crawling through the air through the ventilation holes to extinguish the story, the beast something roar free of intelligence, so there was no confrontation between the doctor and the villain TARDIS exists inside the hole in one way or another although the hole was not opened until long after the fall of TARDIS in the crust of the planet . Finally another ready solution had no logical reason - I mean, why do not the monster sink into the hole once the pit is opened? Why not drown in all those past years instead of imprisoning him anyway. Why not - I can continue but I lost interest ...
