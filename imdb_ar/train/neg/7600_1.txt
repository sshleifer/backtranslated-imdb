This film proves that good acting comes from a good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor but in this case he is an event. Donald Sutherland comes across amateurs. why? Because the script is very dirty, the adjustment is very bad and the actors seem bored and heartbeat. The atmosphere of the film was bad - I could only think of it when it was over and put it out halfway. The director did a very bad job and although I did not read the novel, it was certainly a lost opportunity. The atmosphere that this film tries to evoke, the message and the story never reaches the audience. In a word, it is a terrible movie.
