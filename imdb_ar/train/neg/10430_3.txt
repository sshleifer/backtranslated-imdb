There are many good things about the new BSG: there are many Cylon roles for models 8 and 6, for example, which the two players played admirably. There is an old school feeling of industrial design aboard the Galactica ("My ship will not be connected to the network, on my dead body!") Also, all space battles, special effects (although the veteran sci-fi observer will recognize the caricature of everything) Mainly defective. <br /> <br /> This makes it more bitter because the end was very childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the viewer in space, the raid on the Cylons and everything was very good. But the end of Tory? I always watch movies and show these days with temporary hide, so I do not know how much time is left until the end. For me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end occur again and again. Every time I thought, this is the final scene, the last shot, I got another one. Every fake character got its full end! This was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> What is the highlight of the fact that student amateur everything: small scenes of Roslyn. Why is it important for us to know the following: (a) Lost her sisters and father in an appalling accident and b) she stands one night with a former student / student? What brings this to the story? Where was the connection? Now, I am all for a more disturbing European style, and random acts of anything in movies and shows, all of which, but that was absurd. This did not bring anything meaningful to the story. <br /> <br /> Also, I have seen "Your Last Frakkin" in which Ron revealed his ignorance about the plot: he could not come up with a good end to the story, so .... he did not! It's not about personalities because they made the last episode. The idea of ​​"This was thousands of years ago in the past", something mitochondria Eve, also in the Hitchers' Guide to the Galaxy, was used to believe me, there are a lot of BSG watchers who know the story of this H2G2 designated. Speaking of Hera, there is now a story that did not work well at all. Instead, we get Roslyn, her 20-year-old former student. Do not get me wrong, I'm all older women with younger men. To force them more. But this ... had no meaning. <br /> <br /> All in all, (writing) This series is defective as it wanted to be its characters. That Morisso goes up for another episode. I hope to be Lost and 24 years better, with the finals of the series.
