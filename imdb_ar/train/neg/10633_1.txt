I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover contains a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The film begins with a number of rocket-bomb shots, most of which are not related to the manned flight. Sibrel smoking gun is a short video clip for astronauts preparing to broadcast a video. He released his voice rather than let us hear what the crew said. The video ends with his curiosity with a Zapruder movie. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography, etc. make me think he is too ignorant or has a sort of ax to grind against NASA, astronauts or America in general. His knowledge is bad, as is this video.
