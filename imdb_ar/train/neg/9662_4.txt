I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I did not do that before watching the TLB, and I must say I was very surprised to see the average rating above in IMDb. I found that there is a complete lack of story. I fell in it (unfortunately, not the way we were rescued by the soldier Ryan in the film), and he also had a sudden ending, which was very unsatisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But be ready to laugh ... Some players are thrown into the air after an explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. The key to the outdoors or the somberhood during the First World War is too much for me, especially when it is played countless times during the movie ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really made me laugh until I almost cried were the scenes that contain On close combat. Screaming and screaming German sounds ... incredibly funny. It seems as if one representative / one voice actor is speaking, because they all look exactly alike, and it sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I will never recommend this movie to anyone, except for people who just want to get some laugh because of their sad and full quality.
