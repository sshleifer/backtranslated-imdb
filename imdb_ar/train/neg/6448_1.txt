Creature Unknown is the right word for this film. Or perhaps it should be called an unknown film. This movie is a piece of crap from the very beginning. It contains a really stupid "plot", "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some 30-year-old "children after adolescence" are trapped in the forest by a creepy, creepy creature dressed in a rubber suit that lurks endlessly. What you get with this movie is a set of words and a little precious work. You have girls walking through the jungle and talking, then you have guys (with heavy mascara) walking in the woods talking. It's all very boring! <br /> <br /> The creature is rarely seen in most of the film. When the picture appears distorted to disguise the fact that it is a man wearing a rubber suit, the movement shows that it is a suit, and therefore the cause of image confusion and distortion. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film in any of these words, and those who probably praised it are the people who were taken from the street to "act" in this truly amazing film! Skip this one for sure!
