There is no question about who will train the students in this film: Major Ketch Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays the role of an officer who is committed to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier from his students - the bomb. But it is not so rigid that it is unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he is changing his mind about the value of women working in the military. It is difficult when it is, but at other times it is a clear mix of coach and pastor, and the roles I mastered in other films. His character is the basis of the work around which everything is going. O'Brien looks natural in this role, and plays it beautifully. Two things help in this film: O'Brien's performance and stunning special effects end.
