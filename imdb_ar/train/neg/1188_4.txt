Kurosawa really blew on this one. Each genius is allowed to fail. The concept is good but implementation is not very clear. <br /> <br /> There is an atmosphere of imagination about this film making it an artistic film. Tokyo's afflicted poverty deserves a more just and realistic picture. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. Very disappointing film.
