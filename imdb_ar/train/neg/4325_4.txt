The second in the holiday series is the least fun easily, where Clarke Griswold wins a family trip to Europe. <br /> <br /> Tasteless taste, down humor that worked well the first time is practically nonexistent here. This is certainly the fault of director Hackerling, who is obviously not close to a good director like Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring text that contains a handful of decent lines circulating around him. Chevy Chase injects a form of life into action, but it simply is not enough and Eric Eidel, a very funny little boy, misses a small role as an unlucky Englishman. Some moments that are likely to be joyful are not being exploited in their full potential and often leave scenes worsening. All images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost not funny at all (like how to be polite English from SOOO). <br /> <br /> Apart from some scenes, there is barely a laugh in sight and this ends in one full jerk. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me), the movie is watchable, but nothing more.
