I really did not expect this kind of movies outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexual abuse of children and turn it into an "exciting story" is just a disease. Auteuil (previously admired) revolves around a kind of Rambo that saves children, was ignorant and humiliated all sexually abused children around the world. <br /> <br /> What is depressing is that the stunning and earth-moving movie "Happiness" came the year before this film. Men and their classes should be ashamed of themselves. It is impressive to read some of the comments by the most intelligent viewers there. They were able to see the lousy and ridiculous dealings with the subject. Those who believe that this is a great cinema offer a disgusting amount of ignorance and need to watch "happiness" to open your minds to the horrors of child sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely? To be abducted and sold in sexual slavery or to be harassed by a neighbor, teacher, friends or even a relative? They are ... I wonder. If they are to make a film about the international slavery of children of any kind, they owe it to everyone to make it real and emotional, rather than the nagging nonsense. 10/01
