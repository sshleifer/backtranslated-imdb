I look around the video store in a state of shock, where Steven Seagal still has a track record of motionless movies that has three movies reaching the shelves in less than a year. The attack power is the third that is no less than the promise of first entry into Sci Fi Genre to our constantly expanding Seagal. The bad movies flickered in front of my naive eyes. Sure, this is not the case with no entertainment and a bad film as it came. <br /> <br /> Seagal bounced back a little with Shash Man - Trashy-enjoy the last time we saw it. However, the power of attack must be his worst film ever! Do not argue in order to go out for Kill or Ticker or even Black Dawn folks.This bottom of the drainage tank is here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is the return of Steven Segal to the model should have to write a 100-page essay on Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another client / I'm so bad again his name is Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his team which leads him to an evil plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public. Not to mention that traders are not here. <br /> <br /> The entire output from output to representation is weak. Was this film filmed in the dark? 2. The work is terrible and poorly implemented. <br /> <br /> Producers have also decided wisely to do what fans most dislike: throwing them into a double trick after a double trick called Steven Seagal. Show little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> While it was said that Attack Force was not the movie that Stevie had recorded (originally a harvester) it certainly had to be better than the attack force.The post-manipulation production did not make it more coherent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad for director Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal have proven that they will be judged forever for re-launching their inappropriate productions. <br /> <br /> So now this makes Seagal in an impossible position to reach something to atone for this mess. But after seeing how the power of the bad attack turned, do we really want him to make another film?
