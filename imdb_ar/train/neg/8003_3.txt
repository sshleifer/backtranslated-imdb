Do not be fooled as you browse through the "glowing" quotes on the DVD box. "Very entertaining." , "A frighteningly scary freak." , And worst of all, "on par with the jaw". This film is not the above. <br /> <br /> Normally, it does not bother me to write bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe that this movie rests at a comfortable rate of 7 on IMDb. It is not worth it. <br /> <br /> After a very light attack in broad daylight carried out by a monster created by, and what, the chemicals thrown by the lazy scientists, this film does not go anywhere at all and goes there quietly. Essentially, the monster stumbles on a girl (I will give her points to design a good creature but this is not the creation of WETA) and her quasi-comedian family spends an hour and a half to follow ... in the sewers surrounding the Han River. The search lacks any suspense - again, someone has launched this on an equal footing with the Jaws? - By the time he found it realized that it was largely useless. Otherwise, much of the film is committed to government quarantine, culminating in one funny scene involving a man spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus station. <br /> <br /> Blech. This was bad. I'm not kidding. Want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent a deep hike. At least you will save 30 minutes of your life.
