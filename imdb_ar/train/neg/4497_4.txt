- I had planned to write something explaining what I did not like in this film, but that would be harder than I thought. Frankly, I can not remember much about it. I saw it only three days ago and there was no impression of me. This is usually a real stinky mark. The only thing I remember is that he was incredibly bored by most of him. The novelty of the presence of Humphrey Bogart in a detective-like fashion wore a real fast. It would be different if he could act, but he was a one-note artist. The killing scenes were handled quietly and there was no suspense to lead them. If you can not find the killer five minutes after the movie, you'll need to see more European horror. Casting is the dead gift of a killer's identity.
