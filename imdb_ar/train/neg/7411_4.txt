An interesting idea involves an alternative dimension within the hospital. Little - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and the old Twilight area rings. Strong atmosphere, and the setting was great. There were also very smart "time-ring" moments that always enjoyed this solicitous appeal. The story had a lot of ambiguous signs that led me to believe that all the strangeness that followed - slips / ghosts time / demon winged bats odd and the shape of a gol full of heavy metals. Those were dark floors that let me down. Based on my presentation, the film does not give any explanation for the events. While there is an ambiguous expected / always welcome in this genre of films. I took the dark floors to new heights of mystery. I do not expect things to end with a nice ribbon, but I should not let go of my feelings, "Hey? ... Is this ...? "Dark Floors" left me with a largely unsatisfactory suspicion that "it was all a dream" - a disgrace that even the last ball I was on board and enjoyed the movie.
