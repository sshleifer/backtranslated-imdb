This film is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst film I have ever seen. I am very impressed with the paper, but most of the deaths in this film do not appear. It only shows us dead bodies, and the only scenes of death that actually appear in this film are appalling. The graphics look very fake. The actors are awful as well. There is no real emotion from any of them. I did not waste my time watching this piece of movies only, but I had to put myself into actual sections of the beaten animals at the beginning. If I could rate this level-10, I would. F * Cliche this movie. It's crap. <br /> <br /> You do not see it.
