Little sister, I amateur horror film fans. We have seen almost everything, especially zombie spells. Now, we've seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad movies. This BY FAR is the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life. It was not only terrible acting, but the special effects, graphics and "zombie" makeup was the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eyeshadow around the eyes), this is complete proof that you should not judge any book through its cover. Cause the cover of the film is the only nice thing. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so determined that this film went so far as to put a sticky note on the inside of the film before I brought it back to the movie saying "suck this movie, do not waste your time, count now" hahahhaa I do not want anyone else miss a good night movie on this Movie POS! I do not even know how I got the ratings I got, it should be negative
