Three tales are listed in this film, and it seems that it has been filmed without the knowledge that this is a miniature film combined. The designers connect the three short essays by linking them all to Martin Kove, although you have never seen some threads with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first short article contains the thrilling Vivian Schilling, a woman who fears everything under the sun (she makes Adrian Monk look brave), having spent paranoia alone at home. You will literally scream at Vivian to do some silly things. She spends most of her time in Lilly, offering her wonderful features. But her film is the worst if not the most exciting. <br /> <br /> The second short shot is owned by Bill Paxton and depicts his Hell colleague in Hell. His roommate, the eccentric genius, allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last short article was funny as the man feared that death would take him at any moment, just like his friend who had suffocated to death on olives. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, as the whole movie seems cut off with little thought involved. For lovers of Bill Paxton.
