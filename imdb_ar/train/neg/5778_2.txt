Well, so I'm dying to see this movie. My friend scoffed at "Who's Who" in the horror land that is in the film .... Well, I've rented it from my friend, recovered it and started watching it. Supposed to be a comedy .... I did not even smile once, even a 40 minute sign. <br /> <br /> Is it a budget? Not at all, in fact, there are movies there that cost everything at all and are amazing (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I could not help but realize the similarities (ie, theft) of a low-budget independent film, "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my own assessment of it (it destroys this film BTW). <br /> <br /> This movie ... had the potential to actually do it. He had a "stellar power", the stolen plot (allows filming behind the film industry ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... Seriously, this angers me more and more thinking of), ... I was really funny. Lots, lots of jokes fall down. Acting is fine for what it is. But it continued, it was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this two, because it was not great, but that's the only reason.
