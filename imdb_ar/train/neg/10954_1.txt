If there is a 0 star rating, I will gladly deliver it to this very awful pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is quite good and that if it were different would have been great but it would make it worse. The main task of holding a group of people in the testing room is fine, but where is the experience? All I see is a group of non-courageous blonde surfers and chatting about music and culture that I do not know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and ridiculous. The whole point of reality TV is to show the truth. If you select a "challenge", do not make them play with exaggerated props of food and typical cultural elements in Friday Night Games. Make them do a real challenge. As for earning money, that's fine if they actually earn it! These people are nuts. If they made the offer better, the actual idea would be glorious. But this will not happen!
