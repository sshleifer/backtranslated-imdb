I do not like this film, but I did not think too much about this book which, although it was praised by many as a "masterpiece", I found a lack of personal development and was separate and illogical in the plot, although it was much more not It can be published from the first "The Road to Los Angeles" effort until it became fashionable in the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the kind of soup that Town makes with these tiny ingredients. He did his best to fix many of the book's shortcomings, but for my money he did not save him. There was no film in Ask the Dust any time he tried to keep his book. I take this movie crap Town. <br /> <br /> In one word: you can forget it.
