The husband and wife team at Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. As with some other artists of their time (George M. Cohan, Vanny Price, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible film footage of Fields and Seeley is their autobiography, in which other actors portrayed: "Someone Loves Me" , Starring Betty Hutton and the unique singing and dancing man Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their time, Fields and Seeley were so popular that the husband and wife vaudeville were acting hard - Jessie Block and Joe Solly - almost achieved stardom performing almost identical action, effectively becoming the "second team" Wildes and Sealy . However, there was a significant difference in the couples' living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites where they paid room service for every meal they took, and eventually ran out of money. Solly was banned and lived modestly and invested their profits wisely, and ended in a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first pianist to wear the rug occupies 30 seconds of the first few short seconds of the flute. These two men seemed to have some nominal value in 1930, although I never heard of them. Finally, the fields and Seely accelerate and begin to perform. Both have a lot of activity, which is fairly appealing. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that both artists continue their movements as if they were about to break into a dance, but they never did so until the third of the three songs they perform in this brief. When they finally start in the envelope, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was happy because I had the opportunity to see these two main artists doing their hidden work. Now that I saw him, I realized why they did not become stars in musicals. My assessment for this one: only 4 out of 10, I will stick to Block and Solly.
