Richard Dreyfus, in fact, is in this light, but in a fairly small part. He is not the "obsessed" filmmaker - he is the group's business manager / accountant. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no exciting scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless the person uses the term "erotic" very loosely. I did not think of watching the film without Richard Dreyfus being a major character. However, I may have realized that the famous 1960s anthem, Susan Leonard Cohen, had a technical impact. Unlike the brief recital of the lines from the end of Joyce Joyce's "Ulysses", and the interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal," it was found to be a poor attempt to mix symbolic elements mixed with films such as "Last Year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou ". If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric band, there are many excellent films, ranging from "Goodbye, Goodbye, Brazil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
