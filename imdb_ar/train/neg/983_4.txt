When Marlene Dietrich was rated as the name of the box office in 1938, as one of a handful of actresses named "The Garden Of Allah," she made films. How can the film be amazingly beautiful, and be boringly hidden is something outside of me. Also how Marilyn if she tries to expand her range and not play sexpot stumble with such an old fashioned story is out of me. <br /> <br /> Garden of God, one of the first films in modern technology, was a novel developed at the beginning of the last century by Robert Hitchens, who later collaborated on a play with Mary Anderson, who participated in 241 performances in 1911-1912. Then I got two silent screen adaptations. The story revolves around a monk who flees from the monastery in French Tunisia to see some of what he has missed in the world. Running to a similarly protected unmarried woman and spent her first years caring for a sick parent. She is now traveling in the desert and the two meet in a train. <br /> <br /> Women of course Marilyn and fugitive monks are Charles Bauer. I'm not sure what was going on in the mind of David or Selznick in filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman probably made it palatable to the public. But you can bet that the public, which will move in 1936 when it reduced its money for a ticket, expected to see Marilyn now in Salome instead of a saint with that title. The audience still remembers Rodolphe Valentino and you can bet that he had some romantic and romantic desert that they expected. <br /> <br /> As for the monks, you must remember that they are supporting themselves in the monasteries and this is special bottles one particular wine that happened to be Pu'er is the secret. The monastery will have to rethink its economics if Boer leaves. The monks are a group of honest brothers, but from the top of the man Charles and the dragon at the bottom have the right to be a little interested in some personal interests. <br /> <br /> In any case, many religious rants are said here by a pair of threads that really are not suitable for the parts. Especially Marilyn Dietrich. I was watching this movie with the eye of a special desert cinema colored and forget the plot.
