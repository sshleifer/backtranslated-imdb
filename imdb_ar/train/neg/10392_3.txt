I will not bother the film's summary because you know what the film is about and there is almost no plot anyway. I have seen many reviewers call ISOYG an "anti-rape" film or even a feminist statement, and I have to adapt to the blatant hypocrisy of these allegations. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do you do? See on the cover of this film? That's right: a graceful woman behind. Whether Zarshi's attempt to make a statement against rape - and I do not think he was - they fall quite far. The film commercializes sex and tickling sexual abuse and pornography (all but the actual hacking), so that no one but the crowd of hard-core exploitation will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Rape) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and difficult to watch. There is something to be said for providing an awful crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to last for 30 minutes apparently, nothing. There was also little development in the victim's personality and only a few rapists were developed a little (just moments before his death) and thus the scene is never involved at the emotional level. Really, they are just being introduced in order to show extreme sexual violence and you can tell through the films that ISOYG is associated with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it only attracts the exploitation crowd. <br /> <br /> Finally, few reviewers praised the Zarchi documentary style and the lack of soundtrack. But given the inefficiency of everything else in the film (acting, script, etc.), I think these were financial decisions and that the film looks like a documentary film because it literally connected the camera and allowed its pornographic actors to do their work. /> <br /> I will not wake up on my big horse talking about ISOYG content. I am all for exploitation / horror and I love video. In fact, I give this movie three stars just because it really pushes the envelope farther than some other movies. However, they are also poorly made and after the rape occurs, you just have to be bored for the rest of the movie while we watch a bunch of murders, mostly slow murders and waiting for the credits to flow. <br /> <br /> You may be worth seeing once if you are a fan of hardcore exploits in the seventies, but I tell you, the movie is very bad and does not deserve its notorious reputation.
