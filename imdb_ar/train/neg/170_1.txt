Viewers are flocking to everything, including title sequences (now funny), making us think this is a cinematic miracle, but, trust me people, this is one of the most embarrassing bad movies you can ever see, and if you do not laugh about it yet Five minutes, I say you have lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Neffin plays a Royal Air Force pilot who is judged to be one of the most well-to-do men of the air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, as he drowns in his certain death And fiery. (Not romantic ...) Of course, he has taken advantage of a strange opportunity behind metaphysics, washed on the beach, just as the air traffic control itself is watching her bike. (They are taken away immediately). <br /> <br /> Looking beyond exotic erotic subtexts (so on the top, you really need to refer to them as miraculous texts, from a naked boy sitting naked in sand playing. His little flute, to a heavenly courier, so a makeup / queen was put in his clothes more comprehensively than the ladies'), the most unusual aspect of the film is how to weave such bad drawings. Of national and ethnic stereotypes in a twisted attempt to say a kind of point about global nature and the power of love. We got it - fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, girls like back, and apparently, all you have to do is cry a bit to make your movie get 10 stars on IMDb program ... <br /> <br /> As for production quality, continuity / editing is bad enough to induce swings, lighting may be worse, but you do not have time to notice because the script is very bad. There are games played using Technicolor, (Everything that works in the sky is black and white if you can know the meaning of it), and predicts, (very funny, my members and colleagues from the audience who like movies like this usually cheering and laughing when finally, it ended up with Dr. Duck's motorcycle in a wreck) And the freezing movement (the funniest thing because women's leadership is very poor But you know that the hands of the theater were launched from the camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are early shots on the beach, but after all, all this is a cliff. The stairs (moving like a moving elevator) hardly have Odessa steps, to say the least, I would really warn anyone of feeling like he will need to see this lame attempt at making films at his expense. The film is generally bad enough to be funny, and that's the best thing I can say about it.
