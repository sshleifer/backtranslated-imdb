A little boy comes in a lot of money and starts immediately on his promotion. Unfortunately, the guy who is already money is so bad. He wants to plunder him again. When he discovers who has the dollars, he begins to try to restore them. Continues to be frustrated by this little boy who is lucky enough to prevent him from falling into the hands of the evil man. It seems familiar, I will bet. Highly predictable, not interesting at all. Come up with something a bit different, okay guys?
