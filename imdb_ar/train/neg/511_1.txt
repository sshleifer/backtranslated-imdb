I've been one of some addons in this big bomb. I happened to be in the right place for the security of racing scenes at A.I.R. As was known at the time. Thank God in my scenes in the first few minutes of the film and I did not have to sit in everything. It was a great concert rather than a movie set but hey, the pay was good. The attention to detail was not a strong point at the event, but who knew it. The speed is really slow then the movie accelerated to what was close to normal speed. A lot of scenes were changed during filming and I assume that the cost and time are high.
