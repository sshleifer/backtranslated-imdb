This Cuban film was caught in the arthouse film club. It was shown shortly after the 1935 Silly Symphony cartoons where Isle of Symphony and Isle of Jazz are reconciled. What about the recently deceased Rubens Gonzales in the old cinema and the Cuban flag hanging from the inverted stucco motifs, the scene was set up to celebrate the celebration of the cinema and be synchronized in Helms-Burton's stupidity. But then the film began. Film peeling paint has gradually become more interesting than the lousy mess that appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of Nada Mas is a lot. Carla is bored in the Cuban post office. Their only escape from the full existence of wetness is the displacement and rewriting of messages, and the transformation of basic personal grunts into unspeakable emotional attacks. Many braid footage of Cuban photogenic flows with joy, sorrow, pity, terror and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the story is marred by endless journeys in the artworks of the film school, Latino comics, frivolous Marx brothers and even - in a very frightening editing trick - the celluloid scratching of a schoolboy's distortion on a personal face. <br /> <br /> One-dimensional figures are abundant. Kunda, the boss at the post office, is dominatrix-nosferatu ruthless. Her coarse-headed partner, Konsha, points with different fingers, hugs and screams. CÃ©sar, a metal generator and romantic interest, reveals the hidden gift of writing when Carla leaves for Miami. The chase scene (super fast forward) is thrown in good condition. All this will be fine in the comic strip of Mortadillo and Flimon, but zero-point FX-black and white with high excuses, a goal. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas is trying to row somewhere between 'a crooked heroine between Emily's outsiders and the theme of' The Great Red Poetry 'by Il Postino. Like Amelie, the protagonist is a single white female eccentric who fights the imminent mortal labyrinth by trying to bring magic to the lives of outsiders. Like Il Postino, the film does not flounder about the ongoing poetic episodes and takes the postman on a romantic driving bike. Unfortunately, Nada Mas failed to capture naivete and bypass any of the films. <br /> <br /> There are two things that might be worth watching this movie in television late-night amazement. The first is the opening shot of Carla on the square floor of the checker, which corresponds to the crosswords puzzle you are working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as a cautionary example: Our obsession at the Buena Vista Social Club with Cuban art production can often close us to accepting Bongo's malice on the soundtrack. This film should not deserve a global release - films such as Queue and Juantanamera are equally similar to a similar theme.
