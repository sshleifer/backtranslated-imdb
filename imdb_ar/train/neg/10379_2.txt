The film begins in 1840 in Japan, where a man cut his wife and her lover to death and suicide. It is a very bloody sequence. Then jump to this day ... Well 1982 to be accurate. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and her annoying little son move to Japan to work in a relationship. They rent a house and - surprise! Surprise - just happens to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead people are ghosts (make-up hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> It looks good - but it's desperate. There is an opening and a bloody end and nothing happens between them. There is an attack of giant crab that is just a fuss! Looks very fake - I swear I saw the tendons pull one - it mutters !!!!! There is a useless sexual sequence in the first 20 minutes (perhaps only to show George's body), another after about 40 minutes (but it was necessary to plot) and really drive the evil spirits out in the end. The scene of fighting between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting - Albert was fine because the husband was a good McClour as a friend of the family. But George - as always - is awesome in a lousy film. It gives this movie a very desirable elevator - but it can not save it. I give this only 2 for her gory opening and closing. Aside, this is a very boring film.
