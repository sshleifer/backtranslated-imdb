THHE2 amusing in that you will laugh a lot and cringe, and maybe say "Oh!" "Make your face away from the inspiring hole that interests you" or things like that, but I do not know if it's really worth watching - I was very upset with the horrible military figures who do not seem to know the first thing about fighting. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, trouble, and more people than I, but I'm still debating whether this eliminates my feelings throughout the entire film about how ridiculous it is (not a good irony like the dead on Alive or feast). It was better to spend my time watching the new version of AGA for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So you prefer to laugh, or go to some dresses, but do not hope to get out.
