"You Must Be" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This photo revolves around Charlie Hudson, a former police officer who became the author. When Charley's fianc√© comes out of the city, he is stuck in all the weddings. He spends a week in a luxury hotel and meets with Anna Ben, a teacher who marries. The two quickly became friends and began to plan separate weddings together. When the plot becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips out every romantic comedy that has ever been produced and is it waiting for the end of the film to do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge offer really modest performances, making this film more difficult to watch.
