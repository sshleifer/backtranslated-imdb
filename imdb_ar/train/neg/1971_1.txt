This film is very disappointing. Not only does Wanders show only a very limited musical set of blues music, it is his personal and personal interest in parts of the music he presents on the film that make viewing and listening very tedious. The main feature of the film is the interview of two Swedes who were friends of JB Lenoir and show their own video clips as well as storytelling. Wenders' film presentation is interesting - it refers to the culture of the world (or, in fact, American culture) that travels into space, but his limited view of the subject, as well as the stunning and fascinating reproduction of stories from the 1930s makes this film just a sleep aid. Yawning. I was expecting more from him.
