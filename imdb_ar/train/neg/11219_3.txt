This was a film about marital infidelity and revenge. Twin with a "twin" touch feels that there is a mistake in her sister. This film took forever to establish the plot. The plot has been done several times. The representation was poor for the most part. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley twins live with an abusive father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura takes responsibility for everything. There is a promise that girls will never separate, but as they get older, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at dinner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course there is nothing good that can come from this. The fact that Barry had a buzz was a bad excuse for a way to track him down. I kept waiting for this film to improve and to have some accuracy somewhere, but it never happened.
