There really is no need to start this small review with a plot summary. I mean it's Shakespeare Hamlet for good ?? Probably one of the best known plays written at all. Do not be embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people have IMDb? Via Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to use it to judge a movie, it is in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without comic joking. In short, this German version of Hamlet TV is depressing. 152 minutes? Not possible! It is so dark and depressing that I can not spend nearly three hours. I have said it several times, but entertainment is the thing for me. This wrist slit is far from entertaining. However, I will give it a few points why I felt it was behaving fairly well. Looks like version 3/10 is right for me. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more acceptable. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is so vocal that comedy is not allowed to have any kind of rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts me, I should give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
