Did anyone read the script. This must be some of the worst writing and directing for the whole year. Three senior actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Wise and Miranda Richardson were unable to get that person out. Looked about two-thirds as if the eyes of Giamati were saying, I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the really bad Christmas list. There are not enough lines, but what can be said? Well, the film does not move with a fashion universe, its character is just a creepy man you can not overcome. It was just a dim stroll, and no one seemed to be able to enter.
