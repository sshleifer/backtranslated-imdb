What is the purpose of this film? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and the payday manager great for not doing anything. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my attention to this boring film. A former defender races around a strange woman and his relatives. Begins as a man reforming him for a woman, and ends up beating a man and getting involved in a plot to kidnap. It was so confusing that I could not even write in proper cash. If you see this, oh sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go to sleep.
