What can I say? I ignored the reviews and went to see them myself. Fuck reviews were right. It's a waste of money considering it's a budget. <br /> <br /> Something good, I went to watch Kill Bill after this movie. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, you'll be at a crossroads! br> <br /> Bottom line - I love "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this nonsense.
