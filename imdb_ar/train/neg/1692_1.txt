Well, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge. Trying to be scary once there's a terrible job in the camera and high sounds, but they fail miserably. The plot, if you can call it, is weak and full of holes. For example, how did the care center know that Yoko did not come to work when the people living in the house were not there? It is not really clear what Bill Pullman's personal relationship is about. It's just kind of gone out of nowhere to drive this plot. There was little meaning to what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, little boy or father? Was Yuko alive or dead when a man found her care center? There were a lot of questions that were not answered and I was bored of thinking about it more.
