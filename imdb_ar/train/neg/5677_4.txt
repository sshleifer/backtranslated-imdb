"Seeds" are pornographic torture ... no doubt about it. But it is strange that Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a film that is more polished than any other film he has made in modern memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch Boll, I feel that some pages of the script should be missing. There are simply huge gaps in story and dialogue. Of course, nothing logical, too. The films are somewhat surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why are the six policemen who go to catch the seeds and go their separate ways when they arrive at the dark place of residence, unlike men The real police who will enter the house and clean it in pairs or three groups? Why do not police use their radios? How can bodies decompose so quickly, a process that usually takes several months? (I know that photography is the interval ... but Seed will not be able to stay according to the kill schedule if he always waits for the previous victim to decompose to the point.) How does Seed get to wear bibs and a mask while he was awaiting the death penalty instead From the usual prison uniform? How can Seed enter a very tight prison, walk around the cell, then come out again without stopping or even notice? If nearly 80 people are killed (according to some articles published in the film), why does only one investigator work in the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should look for Seed in the Seed house, where he was originally captured and where his victims were killed? (Did he not think of doing so sooner?) Why does a police detective do it on his own, without having to back up and not even allow the transmitter to know what he was doing and where he was heading? <br /> <br /> This is especially frustrating when Boll goes clearly away from his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly. He spends several minutes on the screen in preparing this, when he could spend some other aspect of the film at least a bit logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the film is just a kind of work as a framework for a few diverse scenes (Paul may think of this as his "vision"). For brutal death by beatings with batons, shooting at the head, execution by electric shock, and flogging live animals raised on their granules. (The opening scenes of skinned animals were not necessarily necessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The main theme is the death of middle-aged women by a master by a towel. It's clear that he spent a lot of time in this and vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs," although there is no soundtrack for Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth watching? Only if you are a fan of pornographic or torture professionals or if you are quite determined to see a sample of pornographic torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is disgusting and can be deplorable at some points, it is more efficient than most Boll films. He may continue to improve as a film director. I can only hope that it goes beyond the torture of porn and continues more in the context of "Postal".
