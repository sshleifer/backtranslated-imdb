This is the re-projection of the Sci-fi television channel that is unnecessary for the Beowulf story, especially after the 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This film does not really enter Beowulf's story, but it takes us in its battle against the predatory beast known as Grindel because it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful Viking warrior is called to free them from the beast's agitation. If this is done successfully, the king will no longer have to sacrifice children to keep him in trouble. After several failed attempts, the creature was killed, but the angry mother and revenge were attacked in the near future, leaving it to Beaufof to lend his courageous and powerful actions to defeat it. "Grendel" looks like he was filmed with a small budget and CG effects are awful. As I said, this film is absolutely unnecessary.
