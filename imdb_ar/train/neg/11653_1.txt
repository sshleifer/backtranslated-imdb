The first one was different and funny. This attempt should not leave the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt to divert humor. The film captures current and old films to break. This time it seems that jokes are being used and surpassed. The audience that I saw with his re-represented only in Hanbal's dinner scene was asleep.
