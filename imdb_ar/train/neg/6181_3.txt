If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie might be right for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and did not even know about it until the day before it was released, when the publicity company panicked and covered the music file with dozens of flyers and billboards. It barely took two weeks in the theaters anyway. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing and poor production begin to describe this embarrassment to the film. For beginners, the names are a bit more: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> The delivery of slow slow lines from Toby makes someone wonder what the production assistant stopped with the camera's signal cards. Angel's personality quickly moves from her city roads to her cowboy and slides into the southern slang two days later on the farm. Her wardrobe moves from elegance to a female version of Topiz - in fact, in the final scene, her clothes match, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant calls the sick. <br /> <br /> The sound is asymmetrical - perhaps the most obvious example is when Toby decides to go swimming, and his voice suddenly sounds like screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no explanation or development of characters enough to happen on screen. Excessive exaggeration, discontent, disgust, and temperament best describe the interpretation of actors and their direction of obscene texts. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after drinking some alcoholic drinks and with your most intelligent friends. But that does not say much.
