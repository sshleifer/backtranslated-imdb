There must be a rule that states that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be produced in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing everything up. RE was a terrifying survival game, an effective curse in it, yet Paul WS Anderson succeeded in making it like any other video game coming. Alone in the dark is the same kind of Resident Evil, so, of course, there is little hope that the director can get enough of the brain to make a horror film, not an action film. Instead, "Alone in the Dark" proves that there is no longer hope that video games will become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, despite the fact that it is unclear that the issue is important, is the biggest problem. With the film. The film begins with only five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important. Just a minute later, the audience stops paying attention and sits only in the rest that hits the object closest to it. Then there is something about an orphanage, some antiques, an old tribe, some bureaucracy and some devils, all of which overlap with each other so that viewers can not follow what is going on. The figures move inside and outside the outline like candy, and some have a huge accumulation of meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons have been released, and that Edward Carnby (Slater) is connected to them thanks to some of the operations that were conducted for the children in the orphanage where they failed. Finds an artifact involving demons and connects them to the anthropologist of his former girlfriend Reid, who of course runs sex immediately without good reason. Then, from everywhere, all hell breaks down, and the husband ends up with a military team led by some of the foolish leaders (DURF), who seems to have a mutual hatred of Carnegie. <br /> <br /> All of this is ridiculous, and the reason I do not really understand it is not just because it's complicated and mixed, but it leaves no room for anyone who really cares about it. Instead, I highly recommend, if you should see this movie, bring a tennis ball or anything to occupy yourself when the plot can provoke chaos. <br /> <br /> Motion scenes in a movie with a terrible plot like this should at least put it a bit, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other destructive crap ever made, with quick enough cuts to cut a chicken's head off. Given that this depends on the horror game, not the game movement, they are particularly troublesome. <br /> <br /> The first movie scene involving a man chasing a carby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever seen, and the rest is not all that great either. Demons look pretty cool, despite the fact that they turn into powder when the kill takes all this effect. Scenes with lots of weapons that should be cool to watch include shooting the muzzle as a light source only, as the camera zooms in and zooms faster than the crack addict's head. All of this is a kind of bouts that stimulate children to sleep at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call actors and make them do nothing. Slater does not seem important to the entire film, though he seems to have a greater talent than he does. The same is true of Dorf, who gets a disdainful role despite having some talent in fact (which happened to him a lot). Reid is exactly what she should be, and she likes sex in the background, where when she tries to act she is a disaster (as is the world's incredibly bad look at the beginning). <br /> <br /> In general, this is the kind of movie that worries me about future video games. If they continue to destroy such a spirit, it is only a matter of time before Samus Aran kills the Middle East with an AK-47, and Tommy Fercete fights a squadron of foreigners. Unlike "Resident Evil", this person does not deserve a second chance, because I do not think anything can help me to forget the extent of this terrible film. It's cute, uninteresting and sexy. This is the equivalent film of diarrhea. They're all grouped together, nothing really suits you, and in the end, you're happy because it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
