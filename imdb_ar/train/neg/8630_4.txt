I know that in this episode there are other things regardless of what I'm going to discuss, and in fact I think they have some virtues; for example, the truth, after we got a very negative view of Jane's vision of past memories from Sun in "House of the Rising Sun ", We can see the side of a gene of things and get a more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me feel so uncomfortable that it weakened my full enjoyment of the whole episode. Before that, in the scene in which Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was suggested that Sun's father was a rich man in shady and illegal ways. I thought he might have been a mob leader, even; mobs were working in Korea, just like in almost all other countries in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode, we learned that Sun's father is actually a president (or a senior executive) of a Korean car company, and that what Jin was doing was physically attacking a government official (he would actually be killed) on his behalf. <br /> <br /> I may be very sensitive about this because I work in the automotive industry, but I say it is very offensive and racist to point out that this kind of thing happens in Korea. These huge and dangerous companies such as Hyundai or Kia (which should be a model for this fictional car company, because it is the only one actually in existence) are working with these mafia-like methods, rather than any ordinary car company in the West. It's unbelievable for me that the writers will have to unleash something like that in the story, and that there was no fuss in Korea any more. Sounds like a weird "American buy!" Propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminal clothing that does not deserve trust in the Third World.
