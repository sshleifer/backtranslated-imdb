Someone must be joking seriously when filming this movie. <br /> <br /> First, it is impossible to produce this film in 1993. Fashion and music dictate that this is dangerous in the 1980s. I think this was sitting on the shelf for a long time before one of the crazy distributors picked it up and launched it into an infidel world. <br /> <br /> There is a conspiracy. Kind of. There is a stranger who meets a random man with a beard telling him that if he contemplates while singing his favorite song, he will be able to switch to the one who chooses. At this point I feel compelled to point out that the favorite song of the unit is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only a minute away from the film and the film has already reached a stupendous level of stupidity. It becomes more stupid. <br /> <br /> The only person is the nose picker. I can only assume this because there are two scenes in the film where he sees as he picks up his nose. To remove the title. He decides to turn into a girl so he can get close to the other girls. And killed them. This is more or less. <br /> <br /> Acting is universally horrifying. Every single performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I will go so far as to say that acting is the standard for a pornographic film. It really is terrible. The nose picker appears to the audience as a nasal picker. The characters of the film see the girl who became her singing through London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even writing this. Anyway, it's odd to see the eccentric lifelong lounging with school girls. Not in a good way. So there is a wide range of scenes where the nose picker is at school with the girls singing a song over it. It is very likely the worst song ever recorded. I will not describe it. You'll know it when you hear it. You will agree. <br /> <br /> Sure, there are some scenes of violence. There is a sequence of Benny Hill-like transgender chases. So there is a little immortal dialogue, which may or may not be taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the assailant picks a whore, "I've got money if I've got the wound." Lovely, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Pronounced in all senses of the word.
