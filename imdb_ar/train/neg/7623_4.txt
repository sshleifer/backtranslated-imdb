This small display is obviously a stupid little series of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the direct-action series, this offer is quite nonsense. The show was clever jokes and story lines. While the animation series is basically a sweet and sweet version of the young viewers to accommodate, but I think children may be easing this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story in each episode is only Sabrina contains some stupid and futile misfortunes. Magic is used to fix it. This is the basis of the idea of ​​each episode. It was the most unusual episode when Sabrina used magic to become a jewel and essence to become Sabrina. So, a jewel becomes a witch and hypnosis becomes a slave to her. This leads to a strange but somewhat interesting scene, where Johar says "Love me only now" and Harvey shakes his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like a god shisse. (And this is quite true because it is from her mind that controls his mind) but this stupid detached offer does not deserve time or effort.
