Herbie, a Volkswagen thinker as a man, is back now, led by Maggie Petton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is the current hero, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love mistake was not good. Even when I was a child, I remember not admiring her so much. I had some hope for a sequel though. I mean the cast is very good and the trailer makes it look like a very enjoyable film. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than it was before. The film is very weak for people over the age of 12. The kids would probably enjoy it but that's it. <br /> <br /> I realized it was a movie for children and all of them may have made the film more interesting. There was very little laughter and became dull near the end. Most actors seemed dead in their roles as well. Lindsay Lohan was fine as Maggie Petton. They usually perform better like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance of everyone. He was very good as a bad man even though he did not have much to work with. Justin Long, Brickin Meyer and Michael Keaton are already there and doing nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson is doing a good job. She tries to keep the movie interesting but she works in a weak film line. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garrant write the script, would it be surprising to be responsible for a taxi and a lollipop? These films make light films, but they fail to make stories really fun or fun. This is not their fault entirely but hopefully next time they try to do more. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family film worth watching if you are a child. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Rating 4/10
