It seems that many of the people who reviewed this film saw it only in the first place because it was filmed near their place of residence. How does this resonate for endorsement? If this film is filmed near the place where I lived I will not mention it in my assessment. It's terrible! Several reviews suggest that this is a naive horror movie or cheekbread, it is not. Sad to see this movie being reviewed as a comedy because that does not just make it a bad attempt for a horror movie but also a comedy. I have laughed though, to what extent the film was incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has two good things, the mask and weapon of choice. Unfortunately, it would have been better to watch an hour and half of the mask and the weapon lying on a table and then watching the trash. Social commentary behind the film is also laughable, stupid events. Do not bother with this movie, you've wasted time reading this review and are no longer lost on this movie. Arrggghhh! It is outrageous that such films are produced. I expected to be credited with sending the entire crew to Alan Smithee, the name used when a person, usually a way out, does not want to add a movie because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> Nothing is recovered in this film, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I feel I have been separated. Avoid. 1 out of 10
