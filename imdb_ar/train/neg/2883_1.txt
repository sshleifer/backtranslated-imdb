This movie is just too awful. So bad that I can not afford to spend anything other than a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes have been properly activated. Lots of slaughterhouse shots. Exotic cuts and adjustments. There is no continuity to this plot. The acting is the most amateur I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this film bomb was made to make some money without regard to the accuracy of its content. The camera works out of focus sometimes and always brittle. It looks like it was filmed on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have served life imprisonment with Dennis Rader, I hope they will put the men who made this terrible film into prison as well. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not think about watching this. I'll give it a negative star if you can.
