I was fed up with movies that seemed amusing in a one-line summary, and then I ended up being equal to what you found at the bottom of the manure pile. <br /> <br /> Who knows: The "magic" may have seemed interesting on the pitch to the studios, even with a "big name" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - Wink Wink and Nodej Nudge) and the likes of I dunno, ...) <br /> <br /> But in the film, the film breaks up faster than the paper-carved statue in a rainstorm, and it appears that these founding people are trapped in an island palace off the east coast, one of them (a woman, I think) is targeted By a Satanic cult that gives birth to a child of hell while others are being attacked by ways. <br /> <br /> Well, here you have a cross-section of plots from "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Indians Indians" and a few the movies The other smaller in Satanic worship is the Amok line, none of this game is too entertaining, and it will often oscillate from one scene to another until it ends. <br /> <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasslehoff are much helpful. Get a check and do not seem determined to give them "everything". <br /> <br /> From his appearance, Hasselhoff may wish to have come back with Pam Anderson (who can blame him?) And Linda ... well, from DO NOT KNOW; PETA benefits from celebrity tour or pro golf AM or whatever its role these days. <br /> <br /> The scenes of torture! Ecchhhh. You will see that people are stitching their mouths shut, streaming into the quiet stoves, tangled in the trees during the violent storm, ships exploding from their necks, etc., etc. Sheesh, I think "Mark of the Devil" is the most sad film I've ever seen .... <br /> <br /> Do not bother. Not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. If you're watching it, just find out if you can count cliches. And yes, Blair is owned, as if you do not see it fall down the main street followed by a march band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Magic" - these witches will give you itch.
