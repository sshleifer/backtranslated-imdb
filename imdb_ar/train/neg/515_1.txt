Hey man this movie is bad. It flows horribly. The story revolves around a race car driver who loves himself, then he has to promote a fast-food chain of chickens, and while doing so, does not like himself. He is trying to get out of the contract and the consequent terrible and unfamiliar gags. Jim Nabors looks like he is sleeping, not acting. You will miss these huge Burt celebrations like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinky. Lonnie Anderson's hair is very scary, proving that tons of hair stabilizers did not come out in the 1960s. Or maybe it was a wig. Talk about, Burt wig was not bad in this film. The worst day of the wig was "Smokey and the Bandit 2". However, this film is the worst film for the Reynolds, ever, at all, with "Cannonball Run 2". The original films "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, fortunately, were not the sequel) are great and funny movies. This is not the case. Even Ned Betty, a wonderful actor, stinks. You'll crave the kind of Jackie Gleason who likes to hate. And your mind, this is not one of those fun movies to carry. It's poor, pure and simple. So the conclusions in the end were cumbersome and boring, and worse, they were unknown. At least, "Stroker Ace" was one of his first heavy nails to seal Bert's coffin before reviving it to some extent later in "Boogie Nights," another film, like "Rescue," years before, He can act very well when he has a decent platform to do so.
