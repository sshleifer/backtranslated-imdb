It is impossible for me to think about this film objectively. But I sit down, I tend to old VHS music, I watch the opening ... Suddenly I was five years old again and I took Care Care's special care and watched the movie with open eyes and an enthusiastic heart. <br /> <br /> I can objectively see that this film is a BIZARRE blend of the little mascot of children and pre-eccentric children who have evil powers with a thin story and an uninteresting animation. But the five-year-old inner goes, "Yai! Take care of the bears!" Every time I think about it. So - I just (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this film to those who saw it during their youth at an early age, and can recall the tremendous power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) or the cynical Gen-X / Y-ers who are deliberately looking for a bad / Strange Strange (category that this movie belongs to ... definitely). For those looking for an attractive movie or healthy family entertainment: you may want to continue your search.
