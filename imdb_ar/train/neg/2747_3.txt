I knew it would be, but I gave it rent for some laughs and maybe some reckless fun. Anyone who has read it for a few of my reviews can see that I am very easy to please. I did not really think I would have felt bad about him. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around an old army of dragons led by a huge snake that destroys the world unless some heroes choose who inherited responsibility can ?? Become one with? Good dragon ?? Or something ?? I do not know, I do not know. It was very stupid, and I did not have to do much to keep it. <br /> <br /> It is characterized by a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and idiotic concepts. I felt a lot of random and quite sudden events. <br /> <br /> I suppose there was overlap in the studio or something because the biggest problem I face with the film is that the story seems to be trying to be so great and epic, but everything happens very quickly and passes quickly. I feel that I have just been exposed to a million plot points and a sequence of movement in one big ball. The film looks like a punch in the face. Creating characters or drama does not take a long time at all. Imagine the "Lord of the Rings" in 90 minutes? You may have most epic battle sequences, but there will be no build-up at all, and you do not care much about the outcome of those battles. Was this the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes of me do not give crap, waiting for it to end. <br /> <br /> A fantastic CGI with some fine guidance, but terrible acting, fast pace, and stupid story made it extremely difficult to enjoy this on any basis. Maybe I loved him when I was 6.
