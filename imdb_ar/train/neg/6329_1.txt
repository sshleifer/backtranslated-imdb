I saw this movie misery in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (again when the tickets were already sold for one dollar). This is the only film I ever made (with my friend, while the craziness of drawing "Laser Bra 2000" was on screen). It is clear that my reaction and my friend towards the film was common. I have not found the film insulting (18 years old or now), and even stupid and utterly astounded, devoid of even the unintended humor that makes Ed Wood convertible. This is the real reason why NBC refused to broadcast it, rather than failing to understand Mr. Mike's "vision" (unless his vision of course was to propel the film's supporters to bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I have been amazed to this day that this film does not seem to have prepared a list of "worst 10 films of all time" published. Definitely makes me. You have been warned.
