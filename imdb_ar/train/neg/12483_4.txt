This movie is similar to Conan the Parabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere under all this debauchery but filmmakers do not do a good job of showing it, which is a shame because it can be a decent story. Richard Hill offers a strong performance in the leading role, just like the villain - who unfortunately did not appear in anything else important. Fighting scenes are not too bad - I love the way Deathstalker allows his sword to "drink" the blood of his victims - and there is a lot of nudity and sex to calm the general level of healing all the time. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad too ...
