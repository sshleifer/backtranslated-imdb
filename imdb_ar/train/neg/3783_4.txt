The experience of the animation movies was not senseless at all, but it certainly can not be admired as much as it tries to be good. This is the story of Mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, where he presented his first personal novels) and his journey across the ancient West border, combining animations and computer graphics for Dreamworks. He was born mainly among all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then was kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, and he could get rid of anyone trying to ride it. However, when he escapes from his cage, with Little Creek (Daniel Stodie), the two are friends, oh, and obviously he has something for the little horse of Little Little. In the end, after a brief escape, chase by Col. (James Cromwell) and his men, and make a final big leap across the straits, Little Creek allows Spirit to leave, also unleashes his female horse, and runs to the habitat of their countryside and fellow horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as sergeant. Adams, Jeff Lippo as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Robano as soldier, Richard McConagel as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was expecting to see the horses talking in this film, but it turned out to be like a Dumbo all the time, and the songs by Brian Adams are not the most attractive, but it's not a terrible movie. She was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Song by Brian Adams "Here I Am". Okay!
