I got anesthetized, as the kidney stone stepped its cheerful way through my urinary tract scars, with nothing better than done at all by leaving the painkillers closing me in a quasi-oblivion, I happened to pick up this film on the cable. I do not want anyone to think I paid to watch it in the cinema, or rent it, or? Heaven forfend! ?? Which STRAIGHT saw. <br /> <br /> After playing this terrifying video game and excitedly raving about the battered rooms and corridors of The House, which is fighting the Type 27 vehicle, the Suspended Man (041), and the other impossible guards, my curiosity annoyed them How to transfer the game to the cinema screen. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy novel revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? No Scooby Doo? Attend a remote island for a "rave" shaking world? Whatever it is. (O children today with your hoops and your mini skirts and Pat Bohn?) After bribing the captain of the boat thousands of money to take them there (stupidly posing his own network of rhetoric), they found the "rave" deserted. <br /> <br /> The word "home" was mentioned ?? Assumed that the house of the dead? But most of the proceedings are carried out on fake foreign groups and other languages ​​separate from any form of inhabited residence. <br /> <br /> Is the camcorder falling as a flashback and showing the island in its labor? Party?! Is this it? Oh, so this "rave" thingy is just a "party"? According to the great tradition of reinterpreting "used cars" as "pre-owned" or "shell shock" as "PTSD", the word "concert" is now too square for you, adding drugs and silicon implanted jagoffs, sexual discussions? <br /> <br /> He learned that the concert had been disbanded by raging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here ?? <br /> <br /> I do not think pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the myths behind animated animation in the zombie. Zombies can not die? They're already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they do not know any pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue to stir. At least, that's what the Jamaican witch-priest tells me. <br /> <br /> This means that the bullet that has reached 45 hearts in their "hearts" will not prevent them, and will not be a machete for the trunk. The explosion of the gun in the chest will certainly lead to gout of blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps a large number of rounds in each monster so that it is completely removed, leaving our embryo embryo unable to reactivate itself. <br /> <br /> However, each model gets a representative slant camera camera moments, zombie slaying on all fronts with one shot and cutting of karate to shear. Seriously, this zombie is no more effective than the storm of the "return of the Jedi", who came out when Ewoks visits them. <br /> <br /> I assume that the film's author, Mark Altman, coined it - "Young Free Foundation" - felt forced to include Captain Kirk's reference to the character of Jürgen Prusnau, who must have desperately needed milk money to surrender To appear in this aromatic wetting. There is also a reference to Prochnow's initial role in the wonderful Das Boot, when an unqualified actor mentions that he "looks like a U-Boat captain." "I wonder how much of this target audience of pig-eyed people who have been selected on any of the snide signals to other movies, such as when Prochnow announces," Say hi my little friend, "ahead of him with machine guns. <br /> < (that is, the game ends when you die? you can not win), this is just a bitter film for the reckless Accordingly, everyone dies in a timely manner, except for a pair of white men who are heterosexual Sex. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best use was for the budget of this little, misused film , Although the left-handed Ona Grauer did a good job, as well as her right breast and slomo-operated scenes: priceless! I loved the last scene especially when Ona tried to act as if she stabbed, but I looked like ice I ate a cream very quickly. <br /> <br /> Trying to do something more deceptive based on the time I spent at that time, I pulled the 35 version of my digitally restored version and the wide-format "Manos" : The Hands of Fate ". Ah yes! ?? Drugs were properly drugged - now there were some good movies? <br /> <br /> (Crazy movies, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
