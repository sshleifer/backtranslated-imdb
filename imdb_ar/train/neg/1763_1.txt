This is one of the worst movies ever. trifle. predictable. flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rated one point was that there were a few wonderful sights that highlight Barcelona. I imagine they will use such films at Guantanamo or some other CIA / NSA prisons to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies contain some irreplaceable features, and that has nothing to do with it. If you are in it or have worked on it, I would like to change my name. Really shit. It's hard to write more than this, but I feel that film watchers in the world need this. On the other hand, it will offer a wonderful gift for people who can not stand. <br /> <br /> You can send them to politicians they do not like, in laws, former wives, teachers they hate, former employees, Dick Cheney, W. and a bunch of others.
