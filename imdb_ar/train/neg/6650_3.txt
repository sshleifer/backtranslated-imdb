I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajun had been shot in a more sincere light. My family is from the southeast area of ​​Louisiana and I live in Southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard people who grew up talking about such people. The cajun was depicted as backward. Most of the cajun I know are educated and proud and do not seem uneducated at all when they speak the way these people do. All in all it was a good movie, with great views and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and they have knowledge of the area, but in order to love all things, Cajun, please invite the actors to study the language, live among the people you photograph them and get a thorough understanding of how they are before you go try to act like them. In my opinion, when actors make you think they are that person, this is a more fun movie!
