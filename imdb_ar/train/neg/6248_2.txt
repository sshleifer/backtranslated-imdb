Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science comes out of the window, "faith" and "consensus" become the subject of discussion. <br /> <br /> Because of this fact, I was given a failed sign for a documentary about Al Gore. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting a smart discussion, keep the discussion at the level of "faith" and "consensus." <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world to spend trillions of dollars in order to "stop global warming," it may be a problem knowing the scientific truth: we do not know how much current warming caused by humans. Perhaps none of them, or perhaps some of them, or perhaps beyond the next ice age and we were lucky not to boil the planet. <br /> <br /> But the truth remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> Therefore we are required to "believe" in "consensus". It does not mind abandoning any world that shunned "unanimity". It does not matter that scientific inquiry is about moving away from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" unanimously, and neither Copernicus nor Galileo believed. If global warming is indisputable, it is certain that few people experience that the theory can not be very threatened. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the film I had hoped Al Gore would make. He chose his support through true "believers" by "consensus." <br /> <br /> Really sad.
