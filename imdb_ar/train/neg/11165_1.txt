I mean, really ... I suddenly lost my sense of humor or that's just a really bad film. It's stupid and silly and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview that I knew would not be a great movie, I did not think it was bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to good old times when you can find funny lines in any smart movie? When actors do not have to play silly roles in an attempt to be funny? Now we find ourselves with films like this, Borat, Young Men, Scary Movie 4 where I could not find the funny parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of trash <br /> <br /> PS (sorry for the English language)
