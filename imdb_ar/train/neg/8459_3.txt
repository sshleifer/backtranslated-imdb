Some very interesting camera work and story with a lot of potential. But it does come together as anything more than a graduate thesis for a student at a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Hand grip, there is no single pet character, not even a wicked one may admire him. Second, all the actions are appalling - even from Veteran Willem Dafoe. The pork is very plentiful here, you feel a stroll - but one of those miserable employee walks where you drink lots of cheap beer and get your own headache even before you stop drinking. Then eat an unwanted hot dog and throw. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm dealing with a young director who may continue to go places - as I said, the camera work is very good. <br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the ambiguity of this film suggests that we are going to see a "modern Western," and a DVD contains pictures that point to this too - but no one is actually tied to a film that filmmakers seem to know is this The type of film they are supposed to make. <br /> <br /> This betrayal hurts me; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we are embarrassed by the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and in the final analysis, we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took him out of the DVD player about half way. But the leasing shop will not return my money. <br /> <br /> Now, this is really painful.
