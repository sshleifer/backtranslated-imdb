Let me start by saying that this film has a funny point at first with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who are you for heaven's sake? George: I'm the new George. Studio is very cheap to drive Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: The new George is lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only funny part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still amusing ... but again, it's easy for me to entertain ... <br /> <br /> I will not say that this is the worst film I have ever seen (this title belongs to Disaster Movie) This movie is ranked number 7 in the bottom 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who enjoys easy entertainment, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie watcher who wants a good and funny film, you will end up shooting yourself in the middle of this movie.
