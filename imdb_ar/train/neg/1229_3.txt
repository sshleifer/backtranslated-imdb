Sorry, but apart from Kim Basinger doing a good job, it was one of the worst thrills I ever saw. The logic is thrown at a time when four young men are terrorizing this woman outside a busy mall and then shooting a security guard. So far no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, they were kicking off and ending in the middle of the jungle with hot pursuit players. I can not even describe how silly it is to see this woman running away from four backward criminals, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come to help her, then having sex with someone after savagely killing others. Please trust me, this is bad and a little tasteless as well.
