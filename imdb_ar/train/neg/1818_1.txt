Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and she is nude at times attractive. <br /> <br /> That's it, folks. The only reason to even think about whether you want to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the cut-off period of sex in the 1970s is amusing by its date (broad trousers, big hair, Zapata mustaches, etc.). This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the representation is bad, the trend is bad, and the idea of ​​having a great old romantic man is very bad. <br /> <br /> The title, which refers to a sexual comedy, is highly misleading. <br /> <br /> Warmly recommend avoiding this type like plague.
