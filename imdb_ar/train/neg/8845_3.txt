I've seen this and he knows almost nothing about it, other than the brief description I've read here. After watching him I was originally saying that the director bodes well but looks kind of amateur, then looked at other things he did to see if this was his first or second film, but no, he did HOUSE ON HANTED HILL and FEAR DOOM COM. I missed the mark in these two films and had the same thing with this film. <br /> <br /> The story was so wonderful, could someone fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful but has a mind for the child? I gave it 3 because there are some pictures I enjoyed near the end, but this movie is very bad.
