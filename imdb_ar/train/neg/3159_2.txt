Sorry, I already wrote my opinion in this film, but today was the first day I looked at some other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me but the scary thing is that there are some people who really love this movie. I do not like writing bad reviews or criticizing the opinions of others, but I think it is just fair to warn anyone who may discuss whether to watch this movie or not. This is not a good film. I really like the movies and I will see almost anything, but this film made it on the short film list I saw and I was happy to leave. If you are really seductive, watch the trailer ... This is the mistake that you made because the whole movie is basically in the trailer ... Then there are no surprises, just a very bad dialogue wasting time. I love Michael Vartan in the nickname and I hate to criticize him but I think it's my duty to stop others from wasting hours of their lives in such a movie !!
