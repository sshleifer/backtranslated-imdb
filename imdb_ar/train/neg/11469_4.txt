The ORCA is not quite bad, but it is not the best Richard Harris watches either. As a passionate hunter like Ahab, Harris collides with the death game with a vengeful killer whale after the killing of the whale's "wife" and an unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. I yelled at him so much about the importance of leaving nature alone. He does not listen and end up in the Arctic that fights the insane whale of revenge. There are no special effects you can talk about except for what looks like a round mirror to a whale eye --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye so the audience realizes that the whale knows who it is. Bo Derek, as one of the Harris crew has an unhappy performance with Orca and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn do not meet well.
