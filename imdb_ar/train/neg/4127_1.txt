The movie is as bad as this must be pulled from all the stores around the world. Full of boring, boring and fictional characters, and a leading personality with such a disturbing position and dry sound that gives a never-thinking voice to every movement and feeling, this film keeps a record of the most challenging movie I have ever seen. Since I paid the money to own it, I felt a duty to see it, and how I feel sorry. My head hurt all over because of terribly boring characters and their lives, meaningless, less. A handful of children who know nothing about anything, all frozen and worst of all, have a terrible dialogue everywhere, looking only as the main character tries to get a date with the girl. So boring that my friend was trembling with hatred and I was so red with embarrassment that I was throwing 6 pounds sterling. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I did not recover much of my money. Avoid like plague.
