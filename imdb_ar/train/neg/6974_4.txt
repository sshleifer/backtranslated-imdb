Blue Monkey is listed in the movie already but not in any way makes any sense possible. At one point, some children walk through deeper levels, and explore. <br /> <br /> They started to discuss what they would find there and one of them (a girl) said she was betting that they would find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's all. Not entirely important to the story, the only sad connection to the title, she had no idea why she would assume she would find a blue monkey in the hospital basement. <br /> <br /> I feel embarrassed because I was remembering her but someone I must remember I suppose!
