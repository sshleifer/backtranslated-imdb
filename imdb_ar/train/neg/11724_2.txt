I used the name Wesley Snipes as a guide to go ahead and watch a new untried movie appear in it. So far, for the first time, my Snipes-Method recommendation failed in the film. Completely. I had to come here first to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his serious efforts to be wasted on the "contractor". <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears has come down to the bitter flick. I was afraid that the fragile, fuzzy, "illogical" documentary of directing and editing (first brought to my attention by Bloody Sunday by Paul Greengrass) would spread to other films. Next, the stunning "Greengas" style was brought to new heights in a dramatic way in the last two Bourne movies. My fear came. In my opinion, these films have become very bad through these methods that stimulate motion sickness, which blurs misty blurry in "motion enhancement". But Bourne Franchise, as Greene Grass calls it so lovingly called his cash cow, seems to have persuaded others in Hollywood to start unprofessional work looking for big bucks. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you are Hollywood. The procedure needs to be clearly portrayed and presented, not just to suggest poor, cinematic techniques. <br /> <br /> The "contractor" goes beyond simulating "The Bourne Ultimatum" in non-permanent, repetitive sound clips, in the hope that the masses of events (apparently assessed) will not be able to sense them. For example, if you hear a police radio hear the voice of "Yankee Romeo" again, I will shout only. Good opportunities I will never hear again: I will definitely not see the "contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those of you who have not seen the "Contractor": Just be content with the calm that this shortfall provides for your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I tend to cut that to 1.
