You have had a hard time in this step. It was very slow and sometimes I wondered when the plot would come. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be flowing slowly, and I wondered when it would end. I'm usually someone who likes an indie file well every period, but this did not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> They seem to have tried to prepare a lot of this movie. At some point it seemed like a political shift, and I'm not a movie fan. If you're looking for a slow motion movie with little or no plot, this is the right movie for you. For me I felt like I wasted two hours when I was doing something else.
