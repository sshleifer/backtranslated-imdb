The film has some good moments and good acting (although it's obviously a very low budget), but the rating is bad because of the basic assumption that was developed badly. The main point of conflict between the two lists does not appear in a realistic way at all. There are some scenes that differ because of them, but there are no discussions at any depth that can explain how they can be together while seeing the world differently, especially as Glenn's employment ended up in this part of his life. (And Adam is active enough because he supports them with time and money.) Glenn is also portrayed several times in a negative way because he apologizes to Adam for his past. Adam appears to be upright and "traditional" In the end. I do not like to preach this way. I attended a discussion session with the director after watching the LTR, and he presented this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn's shoes (he would do in real life related to seeing Glenn) he could not date someone with Adam's views. Well, then, I think he should have done a lot better to explain how Glenn could do it. The director also said he directed his first film, just after reading "Directing For Dummies." The output was not bad, but it was far from his first effort. I've seen the worst, but I rarely leave films I feel this frustration.
