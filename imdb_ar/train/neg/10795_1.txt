Will someone tell Shack to stick to what is good in basketball. This movie was not so amusing at the stupid level. In this film, the hard-won play that lives in the arm box is not to reap the genie in the arm box instead of the lamp. It is supposed to help a young child play the annoying French cabaret. This film has had a clearer story since the water world, and the acting was awful and I think anyone who likes this flim is afraid to admit it.
