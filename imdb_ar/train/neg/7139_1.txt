Redline is a fast and furious knockoff, without any of the ransom qualities. You do not have to have a complicated scheme with many transformations and surprises, but it needs something! This is equivalent to a pornographic film, where the script and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same thing in the end. But this is worse, because you do not get the value of your money. Boring mind, an impossible race sequence, and a terrible waste of expensive expensive cars, which almost gets negative points for their presence in this film. Sure, it's hot, but who's so desperate for a female on the screen? I feel that the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and clippings, shaking eight balls each time they changed the scenes. This movie will not be seen by any serious person who competes or knows anything about it and enjoys racing scenes.
