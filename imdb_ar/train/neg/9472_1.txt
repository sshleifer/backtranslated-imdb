There is no way to avoid comparing the Cat in the Hat and the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get out of this part of the road. First of all, let me start by saying that I believe that Grinch was a less appreciated film. Cat was ... well, very scary. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey is portrayed as a wonderful comedian and committed without fear to the most outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag. <br /> <br /> Why, Why, Why Mike Myers? Children can care less, and Austin Powers' demographics will not spy on this film. So, what was the studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The cat appears to have been associated with Linda Richmond. can we talk? Why New York accent? Is not entirely consistent with anything written by Dr. Suss. So that Myers allowed him to sneak into his Scottish sandwich. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to modify before they gave in. "As long as you do not say fahklempt, you can keep the accents." Myers never seemed to find any kind of comfort, either in dress, make-up or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes, which were few, were rude and age-old. When Myers picks up a garden shovel and hands it to the camera: "dirty", everything except the tip shot was missing, so that would not help. <br /> <br /> The same people who created "Whoville" obviously had a role in creating the city and houses in "Cat". The sets and props were very attractive, which gave the viewer a very wanted distraction from bad writing and direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was some fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actress who seemed to know she was in a movie based on Dr. Suss's classics, and remained faithful to the genre. <br /> <br /> Contact SPCA. This cat should be fertilized and never allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no sequel.
