Long drama that can not raise any real point. So I became an actress - what about it? I learned to love - a big deal. There is a certain peculiarity between characters, dialogue and attitudes, but this is bad for the film, which often makes it seem ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, plays the lead, speaks and acts like a semi-backward person, so there is no choice but to watch the film about a backward girl who makes him into the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended goal. We were told early (in the film "Barry Lyndon" - like narration) that she learned to hide her feelings, which certainly explains her stone autistic face, but the film suffers from it. She is basically wandering like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not significant given her lack of emotions. Sometimes, the film had that dull and sleepy feeling of Dogma 95. Is it one? I will not be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the Phoenix River. The favoritism feature rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my Hollywood love list, with more than 350 images / entries, contact me via email.
