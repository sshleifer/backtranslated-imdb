I have now realized that by watching this film I have lost precious moments in my life and will never go back to it. Thsi movie is not only poor. It reminded me of every black comedy that was ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks it is a race problem, and "white" people do not seem to like it. Because it does not contain egg reps. Hey Matte, I think you'll find the reason why you did not like it because watching the paint dry is funnier and entertaining, then stack this command. <br /> <br /> Please stop producing nonsense movies
