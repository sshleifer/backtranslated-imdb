So do not think about renting this from the stores, because this is a hell of a bad movie. You think JJ Abrahams has written this movie. Basically, mice are dragged down the toilet and somehow have to go back. "Shrek" fans may enjoy the absolutely terrible, but Wallace and Gromit fans are likely to become disgusted. Also, why did not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean animation CGI? For AARDMAN ?? !! Aardman is obviously the worst ride while allowing Dreamworks to do everything. Error, Error, Error !!! Almost every character is horrible, apart from that terrible frog man, who is just right for the villain's film. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost slept with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, in fact, I was bored with boredom to watch this movie. It is terrible. But fortunately, not as bad as "partner".
