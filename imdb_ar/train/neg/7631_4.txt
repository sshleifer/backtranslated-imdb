I will not comb the obvious peterbogdanovichian defects of the TLPS. Instead, I'll look at the positive aspects of this extracellular celluloid dwarf in the film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to produce a fully sustainable film. This fact alone puts the film at the top of the picture and reaches the top of his film Lame. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovic showed the generosity of some lucky lucky friends, sharing his twin body, Cybel Shepard (his then-hero) with his male audience - not just one but two times. Brava! Highlights in this Vista movie film. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS is barely witnessing a scene without typical country music coloring in the background. (Peter tried to explain the obvious point that the film was made in the Deep South area of ​​the United States (as if it were not bleeding "clearly") so he made this point and beyond ...) How could this be an advantage? Requests? Well, when the film finally ends and the rustling country music stops your tired ear drum massage, you begin a strange exhilarating experience: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all the women who resemble the hope of Cloresh Leitchman. I hope they will one day take away a younger friend who is probably good looking. <br /> <br /> 5. The biography of Cloris Leichmann (whom she realizes is not a technical part of the TLPS) gives hope to all the women who resemble it, until one day they win the Miss Chicago competition. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (Do you think I'm joking that Cloris won a beauty contest, huh? Well, check out her autobiography and then we'll see who's laughing last. .) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was filmed in black and white, which made us face the face of Cloris Leichmann in his original glory.
