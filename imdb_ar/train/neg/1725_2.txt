- The movie opens with a meteor hitting a lake. Without the knowledge of the locals, dinosaur eggs are also at the bottom of the lake. Meteor with the temperature in the lake, converted into a giant incubator. I guessed that, an egg hatch called a dinosaur that started to terrorize society. <br /> <br /> - What an absolute garbage. I have no objection to mud dinosaurs to stop motion, it's all about the film that bothers me. Representation is terrible. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. Comic Relief is just a comic. Logic does not exist. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this film and the actual world is purely coincidental. I can go on forever in the bad aspects of this movie, but you got the idea. I feel it is fairly safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
