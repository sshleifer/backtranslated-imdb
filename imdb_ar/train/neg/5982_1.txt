I'm very sorry to say this but Thunderbird does not even come out loud and does not care about any thunder. At one point I seriously considered going out of the cinema, I remained very hopeful that the film might get better. I was disappointed, the situation did not improve, and even worse, if possible. If I went to see the film with the belief that it would be a "parody" I would still have been humiliated. They have had an excellent opportunity to present a great franchise for films here, they have completely missed this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have the names associated with this film and Jonathan Freaks well what can I say, you should feel embarrassed and ashamed and will not be far from the truth. I saw this film in the pre-release show, I was waiting to see it eagerly, as it grew up in the 1960s with the original shows. To say I was disappointed would be something of an understatement. The last thing I will say about the film is that the puppets in the TV shows were a bit more rough than the place where the actors were in the film.
