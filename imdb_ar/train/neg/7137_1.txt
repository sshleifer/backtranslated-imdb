The cars in this film are wonderful. The representation in this film is horrific. The scenes are proven and driving is meaningless as it is very bad. If you feel very disturbed by the movies where someone turns and suddenly goes ridiculously, save yourself from trouble and money. A good movie for racing lovers? Well, there is a part they commit wrong reference to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can not tell the difference, keep watching it and you'll have a blast. It really comes down to this, there are really beautiful cars in this film, they are driven terribly and totally unrealistic. Representation is terrible because of the very bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, run mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such nice cars will be represented in such a bad movie. If your car category matches the movie category, you should race with rusty bikes.
