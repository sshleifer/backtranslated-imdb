How does the Scotsman make love in searing purple sowing? Very carefully. Now I have a distinct advantage over many other reviewers from where I was born in Scotland. Many Americans take this simple nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four good legs - two bad feet" as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has the tone that the production of the "Amateur Welsh" amateur play by Prigadon will collapse. Liam Nisson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears him with all the power of a man whose grandma once left the train in Edinburgh and Weaverly. Enemy enemies? Where would the Scots without them hate and blame everything? Gentlemen Ruth, Cox and Hirt should be ashamed of indulging in such racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. At least Alan Rickman was funny.
