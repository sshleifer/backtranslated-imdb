This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Brango seemed to have had a hard time recalling his tone so much that he could not connect his lines. The plot was certainly not worthy of the name of John Gresham. No wonder it has not been published as a book or released in theaters. I did not even see everything. I decided I did not care who did it, then realized that there was no "whodunit" cared about it!
