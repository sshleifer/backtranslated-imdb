Since White Noise was a movie lover, it was quite disappointing, as the film director was very good, well lit, good camera work, and reasonable direction. But as a film, it was just as painful and predictable as the other "alleged" horror movies that the market recently engulfed. Although it contains a little "cold agent", the concept of electronic sound phenomena (EVOO) did not seem reasonable. This movie did not explain why some events occurred but followed them. It was not acting out of mind, as it did not add any emotional character, like many of the thriller / modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Sure, I will not buy a movie on DVD and I will not recommend anyone rushing to see it.
