DeNiro is the master ... one of my favorites. I love movies that are good sports (not in baseball much, but hey, their sports movies, right?) I was expecting a lot more for this film.It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, For me, they always looked like they were rushing the scenes, then they ran a little in the places ... It seemed to me that I was uneven. I had it rated as "4" and I was gracious ~ I'm tough with the numbers!
