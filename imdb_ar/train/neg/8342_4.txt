Rescue: 4 out of 10. Earth Day meets with horror film The Christian Coalition. Well maybe this is not bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Clare (played by Alicia Silverstone Loren Currie Lewis) is parked and possibly deadly by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who threatens and is very brutal). I say maybe because she woke up and it was all a dream ??? Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The main problem in the film is that this fifteen-minute plot (well done the first time) is repeated again and again. As Claire wakes up every time, each scene is obviously an alternative dream or reality. She has stopped paying attention to what happened to Claire and I am beginning to wonder about any lame development that would eventually bring this together. <br /> <br /> He was rooting for a scene (which would have made sense to be frankly more logical) but instead got one of those very obvious endings (think the village or below). The film collapses faster than directed by Donnie Darko. All the great endings of the horror films, The Sixth Sense, The Original Invitation of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me were done because the public did not expect a field explanation. (Put even the boat that ends on the original Friday in the 13th was worth the quake) <br /> <br /> Rescue saves on the other hand and ends with every change in the scene. Other disturbing flaws are pianist music (although the distinctive songs were appropriate) is the right time (Claire does the dishes, or sub-plans for Claire's mother), as Claire says "Hi Anyone There" every time you think there is A serial killer around you. <br /> <br /> Some of the minor acting roles (notably Claire's mother, Maureen Oleander, which resembles Mary Kay's coma) also illustrate the first roots of the actor's low budget. <br /> <br /> Both are very clever in half and not enough enough. Salvage only helps you to figure out how to fix this mess. The problem is they really do not.
