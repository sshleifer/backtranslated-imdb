I think this movie was supposed to be awful. But the only way the shock is shocked is in fact how badly shocked it is ... simply. It is an hour and a half of torment. Even for the viewer more than the characters in the film (the five girls). <br /> <br /> Make sure the main characters get a piece of blood in a bad way, which is basically good, because it's a horror movie - a movie. And I (usually) love horror movies. I have no problem with violence in this type of film itself. However, all the violence in this film serves no end at all. It is not a scene other than that, it is ugly. It's so lame it's boring, and also very fast. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if not the above is not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they tried to copy Blair's Whitch project, through filming with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this too) does not serve any end at all. In "Blair whichever," certainly enough, there is an explanation, which is with the camera that is looking for a blair witch. In this film, there is no other explanation other than: "Hey, we wanted to look like Blair's Whitch!" Sound in the film is also something to depression. The girls scream hysterically so much that often you can not determine what you are saying. Well, no effort is made to make anything better, wise or other wise. <br /> <br />. Finally, there is very bad soundtrack like the rest, which is different from the cheap euro house for the worst grunge hard rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: do not see this under any circumstances.
