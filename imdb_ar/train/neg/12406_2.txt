You must request Treasure Island DVD in any movie production cycle! It is an example of a textbook on how not to make a film. The viewing of the film and listening to the writer / director's commentary graphically illustrate the wide gap between what he knows about the characters and what relates to his audience. Call me old fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, not full contact if the audience does not know what the hell is talking about. The director's stated purpose is to make Hollywood films. Unfortunately, those conventions are consistent with the nature and clarity of the concept. The director himself understands that audiences often do not understand the points where he deliberately avoided Hollywood cliches. However, he does not seem to be aware of the idea of ​​having cliches for some reason. It is a shortcut to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they must be replaced in another way to communicate the idea itself, not just remove it. The film is based on a fantastic and rich hypothesis. Two dolls are set to manufacture the character and background of an unidentified body to be used for the misinformation mission in the final days of World War II. Soon each of them will begin to spread their personal fantasies with the character and become increasingly inventive to them. Someone who has less disdain for the "Hollywood author" than the traditional storyteller can create a wonderful film with the idea. This movie certainly is not! Dolls do everything in their power to harmonize with these characters, but they are often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, she has become increasingly impressed with Gonzo, who plays the role of a vibrant body. In a number of puppet movies, always stands out as a very attractive doll.
