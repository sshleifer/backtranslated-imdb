Wanda Nevada is a fictional fantasy film that uses ideas in about 1979 about what constitutes an illicit love story for girls at the age of 13. Text, speed, and direction are horribly uniform. The sequence of action defies belief. Characters speak with the simple dictionaries that one usually finds in films that target a category of less than 10 years, but also include multiple sexual references including Shields character as well as graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy on some level, but it is not funny at all, and the image of adventures but the plot and motion is inaccurate, and a children's film but it offers sexual exploitation of children and rape of children as a real possibility. She also wants to be a friend's picture, a coming picture, a ghost film, an Indian spiritual film, a ragaway, and a western. The overall effect is stupidity of the massive with a bad twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see many great shots at Grand Canyon. Be able to do just fine.
