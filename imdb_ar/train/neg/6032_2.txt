I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught in the left. However, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> For a good movie, you must have a well written script. The left behind the left fell alarmingly short on this. For one thing, it drastically deviates from the book. This is sometimes done to condense a 400-page novel into a two-hour film, but in this film I see senseless changes at all. <br /> <br /> There is something else, there is no evolution in character traits. When the characters are saved in the story (I will not say who), the book explains that it is a long process of looking for oneself. In the film it is fast and artificial. This book has been written well, with people like Rayford Steele, Beck Williams and Hattie Durham looking real, but in film scenarios they are always treated quickly without anything big. In another scene where a person gets angry from leaving behind (again, I will not say who), looks artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian that he does not suggest that I hate this film but I can not in good conscience recommend a movie that I feel was done terribly. Perhaps it would have been better to turn the first book into 2-3 films. In both cases, Christians must realize that we have to take seriously as filmmakers, beginning to assemble a film in a good way. I realized a lot of effort was probably made to the left, but that's how I see it.
