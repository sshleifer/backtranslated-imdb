My husband is a senior fan of William Williams. I also admire him, but I found in general that he must "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedy roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this film. I felt full bored throughout the film. The story was predictable. I realized it was inspired by a true story. But, I think there could have been some thrill or plot even while keeping the truth in the story. None of the characters were developed well. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been more explored. More importantly, it was a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile was interesting. It is clear that it has a long history that has only been addressed in a superficial way. If my husband was not a big fan of Williams, we would have left him after 20 minutes. Too bad I can not get $ 20 or two hours.
