I felt that I had seen this movie thousands of times before. It was quite predictable. Every time the story tried to be a bit crooked, every time I was waiting for something interesting, I only saw what I was expecting. Such as "open another plant baking facility, because there was not enough bread." In two words: the flat story, which became clich√©, bad effects, bad special effects ... Only the dumb Russian policeman, Vlad, was a little funny while he was punishing the bad guys. The muscle pile was incredibly stupid, it made me laugh at it for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting on this shame film ... it will not get worse (because it's not possible): D
