First, let me mention that I am a great admirer of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious to check it out, its first role. No argument that her talent is clear and her performance excellent. I think I can see how professional critics like the aesthetic content of the story. However, I would like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> By the middle of the road, I found myself thinking, "How long should we watch the boredom? Shop girl, stand idly by at a deserted souvenir shop, rearrange the goods?" It seemed like forever forever! <br /> <br /> Then, I think, this may be one of those films where the director tries to direct the audience to a state of relaxation before it collides with some dynamic events. There is no such luck. The film continues in its gentle, boring and calm story all the way to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm passionate. I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic films. But I expect to be amusing. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinema and sound quality can be compared to your neighbor's bad movies. depression! <br /> <br /> I do not understand how anyone can love this movie. Entertainment value is zero. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
