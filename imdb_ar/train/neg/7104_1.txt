The producers of this film pay funeral fees to anyone who dies of fear while watching this film. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy to anyone who really enjoyed this bad smell. Two young men move to a house, where a wife-like woman lives. Very boring, very predictable. In the end I ended up not caring about anyone in this film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
