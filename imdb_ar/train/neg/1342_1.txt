This film is a student effort for Stephanie Petton and its new production company. Although it suffers from some problems, as does every low-budget production, it is a good start to Mrs. Petton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not terribly new and has been performed in films like The Burning and Every Friday since the 13th part 2. But, hearty performances. Lots of big budget movies have only representatives dealing with suggestions, it's always good to see reps trying to really refine their craft. <br /> <br /> The story is about killing a deformed colleague (and potential return). Others divide the secret, but the shock of the event sends everyone in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are killed one by one by a well-known stalker called "The Bagman". Who will survive? You have to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably do not have to care. But if your taste is running around Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people hone their craft, check out The Bagman.
