It was first seen on 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and an amazingly unexpected series of classic 101 Dalmatians. Yes, the film continues where it ended in the first film, but the problem is that it is very similar to the original film. One of the great things about the origin was the speed of the story, which is not owned by this story. The animations are not too surprising for Disney and all we get is the same characters that go through the same kind of story again. When Disney ceases to be bored with the cascade and reverberation, and so forth. etc. Maybe when we stop renting or buying these modest fare they put.
