"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was disappointing. I was told it was a sort of "Japanese version of the matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was called a bad name or it was not time for good soundtrack with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was so bad. There was little thought in the English version of this film, and it appeals only to the "kinetic" genre. It's not a film I want to see again.
