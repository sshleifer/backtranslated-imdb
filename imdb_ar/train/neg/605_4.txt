I will keep this short because such a film does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Because of the setting, this movie may be really special. It could have been another 28 days or even the Blair Witch Project <br /> <br /> In the first 20 minutes or so of the film I was really passionate about, the director did a good job of filming and thrilling, Though I do not think he has succeeded in capturing the real strangeness of the empty London Underground. <br /> <br /> The characters were great. Our "heroine" in this film is a worthless piece of crap, and you really do not care if you die or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for homeless people and for the black man, who managed to give me a chuckle or two (whether intentionally or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain, is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when it is revealed that I was really disappointed. I'm not going to spoil it, but let's just say my 10-year-old sister might hit him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> All of this is just an average horror film caught in the trap of following the simple Hollywood version. This film had a lot of potential but it really failed to reach the mark. <br /> <br /> Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this film had at least five times to finish and kill the main villain. . Rather than running away.
