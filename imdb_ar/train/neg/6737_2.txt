If Deborah Messing is not already portrayed as "Grace", this may be an acceptable film. However, it is just another story about a frustrating encounter with the issues, which hire a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) read about in an article in Time Travel magazine to London for the wedding of her sister in London. What's new in this plot? <br /> <br /> The date of the wedding, neither funny nor romantic, slips into the deceitful sex story of the bride and the best man, and pays for custody to pass the film as four weddings without Hugh, and certainly a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant of history Sexual abuse of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing has mastered the suppressed princess, a 30-year-old woman with a failed relationship history, her nervous movement and ferocity are reflected in the rerun of her television series. If this woman is represented, he gets a role that does not rephrase what already exists at peak times. <br /> <br /> Lots of fermented female links and visual jokes for Cricket and Mulroney with a towel (nice!), but the film is bear with a happy happy ending. Continuation of the expected absurdity: the date of divorce.
