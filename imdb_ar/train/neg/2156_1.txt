I was familiar with a wonderful book called "Goodnight Mister Tom" for absolute ages, and that was only recently when I had the opportunity to see this air conditioning. I've heard a lot of positive feedback about this, so I had high hopes. As soon as this film was over, I felt terrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good film at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was a very bad adaptation and practically lost 4.5 / 10 of the book. In particular, I found that a lot of characters and some wonderful scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, it was very quick and fast, but I was often angry at the fact that you never saw the bonding and love between William Beach and Tom in this film which was really a disappointment. Casting was not all that good either. I thought this could be really good, but it was quite different from the book! Poor adjustment Anextremely, one of the worst I have ever seen. This worthy of a decent remake would be better 1000 times than this garbage heap.
