In my book "Basic Instinct" was an ideal film. He had a wonderful effect on parts of Stone and Douglas and all the supporting actors for their simple roles. He had wonderful photography, music and noirest noir mistake ever. All that adds up to a good movie as much as it will ever get! <br /> <br /> This series exactly matches, can not get worse, misbehavior and lame texts, coupled with inefficient direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you fairly focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which represents an exact copy of the original. These copies are too bad to make you laugh and I laughed a lot despite myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a shining memorial. The only good thing about this terrible mess is the excerpt from Jerry Goldsmith's result of BI1. Michael Katon Jones and the other half in charge of the script included in the "No smoking in this room" dialog box in the interrogation scene and yes they send her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I saw this terrible movie that should never have been made! They damage the original, it's very bad. The only value to redeem the value is the realization that plastic surgery (and I am sure that Ms. Stone has best donated the wounds that the surgeon can buy) can do a good job but clearly can not restore the original perfection. What matters to the human body applies to filmmaking as well. There must be a law: Never complete a perfect movie!
