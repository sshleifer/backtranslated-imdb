Jason Bixon is back! If this is what you're looking for, do not look for it. If not, go better ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Cliches are plentiful, some scenes of exotic fighting are bad but somewhat (used JKD) and lots of bad and cheap influences. Poor Lee seems to be suffering from pain throughout the film, no wonder. It was not an enjoyable return. <br /> <br /> The movie did not even criminalize the movie B - Sure, there was a wicked German man Bleach Rutger-wannabe, but there is no free sexy scene or even a scene of one-shot booty. nothing. Postal code. Nada. Even in the Starship Troopers 2, they had common sense to include obligatory puppet scenes (as for the rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our next review on this mind-blowing sequel ...). I felt that the writer was avenging someone with this - so I would not go into the movie "conspiracy" or anything else associated with it. Except that he had some non-sexual tones, so he said nuff. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing going on - no Jean Claude :)
