I've seen better production on YouTube! I feel sorry for the actors, because the writing was shocking and shocking in the direction, I'm not sure how they managed to get the lines out - I really doubt that any actor could have saved this film no matter how good it was. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot that seemed to have gone nowhere. It is really shameful, since the premise of the film was good and thanks to the quality of the production, the direction and the script, it could have been a decent film. Certainly it was not a comedy, unless you laugh loudly at dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors seemed strange.
