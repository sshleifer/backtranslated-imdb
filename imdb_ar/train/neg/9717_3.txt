The film is quite clear, as it turns out that the only possible bending is to hide nothing. I was basically watching English performance by Isabel Hubert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of her contribution was left on the floor of the showroom and the script was rewritten at the last minute. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least attractive thing in this movie. Steve Gothenburg seems to be trying to explain his role in the magic that everyone told him. There is an interesting stupid sequence where he suggests that his sexual prowess will be able to treat PTSD. It's unimportant. Elizabeth McGovern is more drawn with charm and real personality but a little consolation. 10/03
