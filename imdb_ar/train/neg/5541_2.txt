Since the movie-loving universe has known a person named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically refers to the images of horror filled with blood and sequences of representation non-stop. It is safe to say that his film "Night of the Living Dead" formed a zombie film as we know it now. However, in the early years of cinema, the hypothesis of reused corpses was used only in slow-moving psychic thrills that were almost ineffective. Jack Turner's "Walk with Zombie" is a great example, as well as "White Zombie," starring Bella Lugusi. The zombie revolution could have been another example, but unfortunately, it failed on the line completely and easily one of the most difficult films I have ever seen. Horrific acting, very badly written script, and total lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, but half an hour is spent entirely on the intrigues of a stupid love story and a sensational rendition. Sure, setting up in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could have led to a more compelling story, but all we ever see is internal footage. The leading actress (Dorothy Stone, the blond hairdresser with the curly hair and ugly nose) angered me so much and I still hope that an unbridled predator will suddenly appear out of nowhere to be devoured. Bad luck again ?? If you can fight through 60 minutes in particular, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent end. Still, this is less than to give this film a positive rating, not to mention the recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only watch if you've seen everything else already.
