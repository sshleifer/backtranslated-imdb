The second film by Amy Hickerling Johnny Dangerley is a spoof of the gangster films that occurred in 1930 and were produced according to the tradition of Warner Brothers. Michael Keaton plays the middle-aged gangster looking back in his life as he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) suffers from persistent health problems, Early by Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, fargan plays Richard Demetri's rival crime leader for Boyle and Keaton finally rising across the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious role as Danny Fermin, yes that's right, Fermin! Griffin Dunn is the younger brother in Keaton who has become a lawyer in the area, and his wife Glennis O'Connor, while Marilo Hinner plays the role of Mall in Keaton. The film looks cheaply cheap, making it look like a television show rather than a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins beautifully and then slows down as expected after the first half of the hour. Because of the combination of dialogue and gags, the film retains its own half-time, but loses its strength quickly and slides into the robe and surface in the second half. Keaton chews the scene and does his best impression of James Kenny. Stapleton has many vulgar and vulgar lines that are not funny. Piscopo does "once" bit once too many. Many supporting actors try to cling to the fort, such as Danny DeVito, Dom Louise, Ray Weston as a street vendor, Alan Hull, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudy Bond as unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half develops into a successful PBS type tone or never recovers. The latest scene of The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as with the movie Call Of The Wild Clark Gable, which was seen on Maradak earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, because the target audience will certainly be familiar with the date of the 1939 actual release of The Roaring Twenties. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
