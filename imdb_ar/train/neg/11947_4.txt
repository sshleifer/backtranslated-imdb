An interesting change from the first one. There was more mystery to this first film then. So when you finish asking yourself what happened who was the killer. There are some good parts through the film, where the first half starts slowly, then in the latter half, the speed rises. Everything is fun. The story 22 years after the events in the first film, Norman Bates left for asylum and returned to the Bates Hotel, but when a woman appears to claim to be his real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins plays old Norman well again and the scene was ultimately excellent, as he played a strong role.
