This film has a very small category compared to Westerners on the train or even the occasional meeting of this issue, although despite the similarities in the plot, I will not feel comfortable comparing this to either. The character of Yancy Butler appeared as a dark doll. I was very embarrassed by the writer and the director to keep watching. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy many Lifetime movies but I feel compelled to watch one movie every now and then to enhance harmony at home. It often came silently, but this film prompted me to protest loudly, to leave the room and walk around the house and I tend to myself, before returning to my favorite chair, usually for further torture.
