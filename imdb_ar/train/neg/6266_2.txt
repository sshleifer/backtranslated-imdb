It seems that anyone can make a movie at the moment. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be cast and crew, a script, money and a little money to have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often this type of low budget movies turns into idiots. The shelves of the video store are filled with these movies. These are not just pleasures guilty; they are just a waste of celluloid that is in limbo. Troma Entertainment is best known for its trash movie industry, but most of its films are a golden film. However, some of the films they have produced have nothing to do with their making, and some, such as "Nightmare Weekend", are not worth any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: Team members do their best through bad material. Some hilarious unintentional. Moving at a good pace (should in 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Defects: Tyrannical writing, which includes corrupt dialogue and innumerable plot holes. Poor lighting, especially night and end scenes, which you can not do at all. Do not make it lick feeling. Bad record. The effects are cheap and very dated. The total lack of personal development will not bother anyone. The film is supposed to be a horror, but it lacks this area and is not scary at all. Nothing interesting or exciting is happening. Full of unnecessary stuffing. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I never expected this gem to be forgotten, but I never imagined it would be bad. I do not know if the worst film has ever been produced, but it's a clear competitor. Troma had to leave this movie rotting instead of giving it a copy. Do not commit the same mistake you made and let your curiosity get your best. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
