God is holy. This film was so bad, I think I was on drugs. The character is the poorest thing I have ever seen. This film was closer to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). It seems that most of the movie is on an awful green screen. It was my favorite part when they were in the car, and you can say that there is no horse. They run away from the strange monsters, and pass as fast as jogging. Then turns into a long shot with a silly CG horse. CG generally seems to have been below the 1992 level beyond the mind's eye. I mean come on, really. It looked like a terrifying episode of Hercules, just without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. worst. Movie. Start.
