Steven Siddiqui, remember when I said this: "Try to find the least resistant road and use it without harming others." Live honestly and morally, not just with people but with all beings. " <br /> <br /> You did not do that, you hurt your fans fatally and their morality with these "movies" will not bother you even if I did not know you are much better than this, I have watched the videos you study, you are much better than this Why my brother why ... <br /> <br /> Steam steamed products have been produced and my brothers promise you that I am not afraid of you. I will tell you the truth on your face so we can fix it. <br /> <br /> Well, some of the others loved sleeping 90%, to be fair, I was tired and ate a great meal one hour before Sensai, what are you doing. 12 million? really? Do you have any idea what we could do with $ 12,000,000 that could have been in the theaters and been a great success if you wanted to donate money from a huge profit to a homeless shelter or something. These people belonging to the post-production take you away from the fact that folk dancing did not exist, we could do a better man, the blinking thing was the eye of men in the black film, and I expected Smith or Tommy Lee Jones to tell you they were gills and not eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal are you Master Aikido, why do you do this yourself to us? When you got to the scene, you had a new direct style, and it was obvious that you were a teacher because the way your movements were very clear and watching your first three movies felt like you had taught me something, and now I feel you have been separated or something I feel I need to save you My friend, this time you are the person who was killed, and I will go and take revenge for you by helping you make the best film ever. Bro know who you really are, I know the truth film Nico. let's talk. <br /> <br /> A man with some new ideas called me a Web beak. I swear that you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we will do it for your fan man. Your fans deserve the best. We are commentators, but the ring is about to be attracted. I swear I will not let your film out of the door with one mistake I'm still trying to figure out if this is the worst dubbing ever, or I've got laryngitis, but I promise I can make a better impression of a lame **** who has not even tried . I certainly hope you kicked him in the nuts as a push for him. I can come up with a story and a conspiracy that can be in line with your revenge for the death of your students / daughter / wife / dog / home, and I promise you that we will get you back, and I promise you, and I also want to go in the direction. This makes people think, if you allow me to promise you that we will make a film People must discuss it, a serious thinking that provokes and changes experience. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal This is a formal written statement from IMDb to issue your contact information to you for the purpose of reviving one of the best martial arts heroes you have also seen, for the record is not Italian, hes hes Irish and Jewish so you call it behavior Bad, I call it a wonderful behavior, because you thought 20 years ago that Seagal is Italian: kinda changes your perception is not it.
