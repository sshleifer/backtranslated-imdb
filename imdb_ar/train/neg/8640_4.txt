I watched 3/4 of this film and wondered why he got such terrible comments here. It was fairly easy to see (at 3:00). His casting was good - the role of Kevin Dillon for the serial killer social was very reasonable - it was both painful and chills. The rest of the main characters were not too bad. <br /> <br /> This is the usual stalker / thriller movie. The couple can not imagine until they go to the fertility clinic for help. A "genetic material" donor focuses socially on the recipients and delves into their lives in the form of a stalker. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film was fairly good .. We see "Conan" growing more and more obsessed with raising his child and creating an ideal family with the mother. Of course things do not work out for him the way he planned. Not a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But, the last 15 minutes were horrible. I am very tolerant of the movies (especially at 3 am!) .. but I was quite surprised by how bad the finish writing was. I have already ridiculed! <br /> <br /> All in all, not the worst film I have ever seen, but I will not be able to see it again (unless you've passed the end). The only quality raised here was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers ever. <br /> <br /> Try looking at other channels before watching them ... but if there's nothing better, you'll try it .. =)
