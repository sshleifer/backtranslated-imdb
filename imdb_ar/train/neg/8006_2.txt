What this film does well is to combine action, horror, comedy and drama in a unique way that arouses more emotion than the audience over a typical horror film. Unfortunately, this film has mainly caused frustration and is hardly the "greatest monster film ever" with stories of disintegrating stories, frustrating conspiracy loopholes and contradictory scenes. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning, this film begins in rapid rhythm. The opening scene - the origin of the beast - is a quick camp, hailing the classic "ecological" disasters that gave birth to many other monsters. The fast tempo speed, which was a welcome break from the long opening scene and often surprising from other monster clicks and allow the film to jump straight into action. In 10 minutes you will get a "why", "where" and "how" monster and be ready to work. In this film, the film delivers. <br /> <br /> After another short sequence well, the characters are presented: the zombie son and his early little girls, the gentle grandfather, the talented sister (aunt), and of course the monster. The characters are presented in the context of each other and their conflicts are immediately apparent, allowing the public to feel them when the monster suddenly appears to cause corruption in the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster looks fantastic: an alien so far familiar - somewhat like a dog and thick with squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although they look strange, it is believable and at any time in the film, you could see "threads". Even the beast's movement was horribly familiar, such as the rolling roller-coaster, leaping over the wax of barrels through the crowds, slipping onto the surfaces, smashing them and eating them on their way. When the monster's path intersects with the family and the tragedy it entails, it is really a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there, the movie's appeal begins to collapse. <br /> <br /> Following the beginning of the dynamite the film quickly loses focus and continuity. The plot lines are displayed, then abandoned, and the characters change their position for no apparent reason, the comedy is tangled in dramatic scenes of confusing intent, while the obstacles appear and disappear randomly. <br /> <br /> For comedy, let me say this: I am willing to accept that a lot of humor may be cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so I may have lost my translation. However, as a specialist in Asian Studies at the University and as someone who has lived in Japan for 5 years (I'm still here), I would like to think that I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the ordinary white man. I've been told that there were many parts of the film that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, they were not. <br /> <br /> *********** For example: after the initial attack where she lost her little daughter, the family became a funeral; Everyone is mourning. A new personality is introduced - my brother - and the tension increases dramatically as it becomes clear that the two brothers are at odds with each other. Both begin to grieve over their loss and end up competing with each other over who is the most difficult grief. This competition is essentially funny: two brothers hate each other so much that they compete in a funeral - it shows the barbed nature of family love common in Asian comedy. It is supposed to be this hidden comedy based on the family and limit the rituals of mourning funny, but it seemed misplaced in the context of a lost young girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the plots of the plot. There are many points raised in this film that have never been explained, or worse, are explained and frustrated to prove they are powerless and ultimately futile. The discovery of an obstacle is not an obstacle that can be a good thing for personality, but you expect to comment on this nature. Instead, the public is shocked by moments of peak when there are no longer problems and no one gave an indication that it was a problem at first. So I ask you: Why even put it first? <br /> <br /> This was the case during the film, where problems led to new problems, and suddenly the film world became full of unresolved opposition forces. Of course, introducing new and bigger problems is a tradition that tells a story that has been tested over time, but if introducing a new arc leads to a forced default of another, you will at least expect the new arc to have a full interpretation. Not in this film. Instead, it looks like you've got many stories, each of which only explained 20% of the way, and in the end, the parts never came together to complete everything. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept so much of this may be "culturally". Perhaps it was Korean tradition to tell stories that put comedy into tragedy. It may be natural for stories to move just like a child coloring outside the lines on every page, but it never ends. It may be good to present a problem in order to develop the scheme but then remove this problem randomly without any obvious solution or venting. Or maybe all these are the hallmarks of slow action and the bad story spread in a film that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
