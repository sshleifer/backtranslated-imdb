As you may have heard or not heard, there is no actual fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. One can then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it is really a suitable type because there is nothing else about this film that has any meaning either. There was no story or plot at all, but things happened. The representation was incredibly bad, worse than bad commercial safeauto ads. <br /> <br /> There was not only a fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their makeup looked as if it were being applied by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and out of place, and included one of the characters fighting the zombie with a hedging device (I'm not joking) but they used the sound effects with a saw. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest. A film I saw in my life. The only circumstance that I will not make fun of is anyone responsible for producing this film if I know it was fully produced 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> Even so, despite all the criticisms I have made here, I suggest viewing this film only based on the fact that it may be the worst film ever, and because of this it is very comedic. Even just calculating the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
