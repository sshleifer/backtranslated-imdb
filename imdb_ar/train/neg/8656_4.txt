This is the first non-zombie sub-review done but this movie is worth doing a review of it. Dinocroc is a good film in general but unfortunately, film B is still clear. Dinocroc looked pretty cool, but I thought that the film itself needed a slightly larger weight as in action and violence because whenever the crocodile was shown or in a combat scene, it did not last very long except in the crocodile display or crocodile crocodile or run away in a repetitive process. Jin Longnecker was warm and he was a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the alligator looked fat rather than that it looked like a cartoon cough * damn komodo cough *. I enjoyed this movie enough to be happy because there will be more complement than I can say about some films in general. Overall 3/6 stars and well worth watching.
