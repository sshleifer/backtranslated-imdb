If you like standard Sly clicks that include the top action, the incredible stunts (not intended to be unbelievable here are free) and the backward dialogue; you will love this scorched heap of mountain goats. I had high hopes on a trailer basis. I thought Stallone would be forced in the days he "passed by" to give up smarter people and make an action film that would put a reliable hero in a trusted position where the story prevails and the preparation (and ratification). . I would like to have it at least soon enough to imagine the fear and excitement that might come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects has made at least one ridiculous scene. Judge Dredd is better because you know to go to the theater that you'll see a comic book made in a movie. Personality, preparation and everything else that goes beyond comparison to anything we may face ourselves. On the other hand, Cliffhanger converts the mountain climbing guide to Rambo before you can say "y, Adrian!"
