An exciting story, this has been done several times before. Simple plot plot. The policeman Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell's wife, and tries to collide with a good cream so he can get it. This is unpredictable, and does not even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there is no thinking outside the box here. So I think the only reason to see it is to learn how to develop it, but nothing is done in the original or interesting. There is really nothing to say about this film, it is not particularly bad, but there are no good points also. Russell plays the role of Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. As I have already said. Stowe has an annoying Sher-esque voice. I read the outlines of the chart and I can see the film in my head, it was very clear and basic. I watched him and appeared before my eyes just as I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion all the time. I have no feeling about this film, as if I have never seen it. Given that, it's a useless film, is not it? However, I will give it 3/10 for some reason.
