Alicia Silverstone (pre-Clueless) plays the role of an obsessed teenager trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed B-flick, which is not particularly good but he is very serious about his leading personality. Silverstone is attractive and successful in carving an interesting young woman here, though undermining the raging image in the picture. The cast of supporters (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last film went abroad. No cheesy camp festival, but nothing memorable too exceptional. * 1/2 of ****
