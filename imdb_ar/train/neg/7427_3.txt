When a friend gave me a stuffed set of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I understood some caution. But, since the element was a gift, I really did not pay my proper sense too much. After all .... Movies Free! So what if they were a little ruby. After much interest, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically it was the first choice because it looked the best in the group. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I'm trembling to think about the rest of the form. <br /> <br /> On the roof, there were some good things going that way. Four reps (count!) Who you are familiar with. Billy De Williams, Tracy Scugens, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were in some sci-fi (Star Wars and Babil 5, respectively) so they would not participate in the turkeys.Max is a veteran actor in the soap who was unable to break into the film .... but not a very bad actor Jeff ... well ... I've done good and bad about movies and television. "I was about to discover that Jeff decided to add" Ugly "to his collection of movies. <br /> <br /> The first idea was in the opening scenes. Jeff makes his way with Gusto through the scene "I'm Crazy" before he kills himself in the end. The performance of an amusing veil, really. Unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, highlight the film. Go down from there. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the task leader (Williams) sent to find out what happened to Jeff and his crew busy choosing his new colleagues from the ranks of the criminal element. But this variety is not so much dirty - more like a non-convincing quad. In addition, a visitor, a hacker, appears in his cell as he works away on a laptop. Is not this very much like allowing a murderer to run a gun shop in a killer? Prison is very lame, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When you finally take off, the effects are really terrible. The model of the spaceship seems to have stopped in the afternoon by an 8-year-old man bored and has leftover parts of the Airfix group. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. While on the way to the area where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by giving them virtual weekends of virtual reality, indulging in their masculine fantasies. Everything is good and good, and the use of scenes from their imaginations serves as an introduction to the "alien threat" that begins to appear there. But did they have to pull it out for sooooo loooooong? Alien Exotic? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally, they reach the G-Sector and the foreign presence makes them fight against each other for their emotions until only the good Old Max is left. The end, the film vein is really optimistic, refer to the relay - as if! Also make the appearance in this movie is a character will be nicknamed "Sweatdroid". It is supposed to be a robot, but this fact seems to have been lost to the make-up crew, who gave him swanky features at any chance. But do not worry, it only exists to compose body count numbers in the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scugens, to be honest, did little in the film. They just barely stay awake, let alone act. As I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the shower, so his costume is not allowed to illuminate much of the film. Max tries his best, as do some other members of the cast, but the film is so terrible, and honest. <br /> <br /> The only thing and the imagination in the middle of the road presented by this film is the naming convention of the ship. All were named musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is cute and uninspiring. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I used to think, when you first watched, was one of the 80 direct posts in the video. They seem to be making nonsense films in the 1990s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid them. Although Beer N chips, this movie is stinky, but at least you can make it fast, I guess.
