This may be unreasonable, but this film made a profit of $ 878,138 in Russia! It is displayed in almost all theaters and is still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors focused on this particular "Uh" movie, which has not been shown around the world. This kind of puzzle! Haha! This may have been based on the fact that another film, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was also released only DVD almost everywhere, had great performances in Russia and made over $ 1 million. Moreover, both films had a great promotion, as there were banners all over the city and television commercials and others. When talking about the film, I say it is boring and completely boring. Could be better, really. Even if he had Jessica Simpson.
