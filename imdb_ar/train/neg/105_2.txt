There are so many beautiful women in this situation. Unfortunately, this film is free of nudity. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story was told in this film in 1971. Why the hell are the main characters driving the Kia? Hi? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. This is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone has failed in this work, but there was no 3D, but it blurs the double vision. I did not have the same problem in the films of this other 3D company, the hunting season and the blood camp. Sure, the three-dimensional suck in them too, but nevertheless, I was able to see what looks like a three-dimensional effect. <br /> <br /> This is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> Whatever the case, the women who played the daughter of the lady who ate the ear, yum! I would like to see more of them. In movies, as well. Janet Margolin appears at an early age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
