This must be the worst movie ever! The scary representation of the film. Lots of blood, but have no idea of ​​their source, because they do not even see you cuts. I can not believe I'm wasting my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy, not a horror film. This is a shame on horror movies !!! For anyone if they are in Asia why is there a white policeman who skips garbage cans in waste management ?! There are a lot of other languages ​​that do not even know what is happening in half the time. Editing the movie is a joke, and my teenager may be doing better. If you go to a movie theater this wicked old man was working on the window that would be the first idea. Do not watch this movie !!! Not even see how bad it is, you will be sorry because you did!
