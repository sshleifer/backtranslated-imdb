A clear and joyful "drama" around a handful of high schools (I think) kids enjoy hip hop without dancing, dancing or graffiti and trying to become DJs in Roxy - or anything else. To be absolutely honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love music agree that this film is acting terribly and surprisingly failed. This child is supposed to be loved and pleasant. I found them cute and boring. The person he really hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on metro trains and this is seen as great. Excuse me? It's a distortion of public property that is not his to begin with. These "great" children also benefit from city electricity so they can have a big dance in an abandoned building. Uh huh so we should find a group of violators of the law loved and fun. <br /> <br /> I could have forgiven all that if the music is good but I can not stand on hip-hop music. The songs were - at best - modest and were non-stop! They're always playing! It came so fast that I was moving through endless numbers of music. (Cut the music and you'll get a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are a few fictional numbers - Metro Dance Fight, Santa's really funny number and Roxy Climate Show. If you love hip hop, here's your movie. But you're looking for a good mixed drama - forget it. Also how did this get rated PG? There is an incredible amount of right in this.
