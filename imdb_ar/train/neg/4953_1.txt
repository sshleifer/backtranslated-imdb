I never commented on IMDb before, but I feel compelled to do so after watching the animation for Batman. In the absolute garbage! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 1990s, so what the hell are they trying to tamper with with the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter of complaint to the World Bank. The original animation was dark and opaque, just as Batman was meant to be. The World Bank had to spoil this with some of Batman's future figures. Now they produce this drivel. Joker does not look away from Joker from DC Comics. You must sue the capital. I urge everyone who agrees with me to send an e-mail or write to WB and use the power of people to restore the original version
