The back of the DVD stars stars Ellen participating in this film. It does not appear until two-thirds of the film ends and then its secondary role. I do not consider that a supporting role, but a "small" part. The plot also has many unexplained elements. Some examples: Why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why does her youngest son lead the train? He says about a "sucker" bet that does not explain anything. It is clear that the screenwriter does not know the definition of a sucker's bet. This movie is not worth the rent price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it should be seen.
