What the heck was this. Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential anxiety mixed with cheap horror. There were moments that were annoying but each was canceled by horrible music, CGI, or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange novels like this is that he is lazy. Even David Lynch's work sometimes seems like, and like his exciting programs and movies, it takes a very long time. Unfortunately, this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's the limit. I assume that this affects the feelings of the teenagers and the fear of the loneliness we all feel, but does not make the characters loved enough for us to care about their fate ... whatever they are. The last scene leaves everything ambiguous.
