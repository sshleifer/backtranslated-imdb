There are some very talented black directors, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Deux, Denzel and others who bring credit to the film industry. Then there are the Wayans brothers who simultaneously (15 years ago) staged a very funny television show "In The Living Color" which launched the life of Jim Carrey among others. Now we have stupid alternatives to humor and total gags (toilet humor) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those who were filmed in the film "The Little Man" they can not be. A baby with a full set of teeth and tattoos is accepted as months only? The child comes with the shadow of the fifth hour. It is inevitable that the child has had sex with his foster mother behind their husbands, Darrels, his back, yes, this is hilarious. As a master criminal the "little man" is the dumbest on the planet. He stifles a huge stolen rock in a woman's wallet, and then he has to chase her. Chaz Palmentier, co-star, Chaz, presents the best line: "I'm surrounded by depression." Based, with no credit, on the drawing of Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is so stupid that it is not funny after. An idea of ​​how bad this film is Damon and Jayn's on Jay Leno appeared the other night, before the BAT Awards did not do so, even mentioned this horrible film. When Hollywood stops the green lighting waste from Wayans Brothers. When they get more than their white man's guilt in all probability.
