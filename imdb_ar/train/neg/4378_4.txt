Given the title and art of the strange box, I was ready for almost anything. I may have been forced to expect a slightly higher rise, because I left a little dry. <br /> <br /> The crew of the film, which works on a soft sexy film, ends up in a strange house when they are lost at home. Fog and decide that the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where has this setting not been used before? The difference here is the abnormal nature of sex. All the goods are not allowed (the thighs have been illegal in Japan for a long time, what has been shown is unlikely) The film tries its best to show the viewer how difficult it is to have sex. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all the strange events, a clay monster (I can not understand him) begins to kill men and rape women ... and then kill them too. Some scenes are too many, most notably a woman whose intestines were pulled through the vagina or another woman spit no ... things, but otherwise the bull is a pretty standard fare. <br /> <br /> Eventually the film is pulled through its own designs; from over-sex to being a horror image of the strait and extremely outrageous to act as a copy of sex. The media can work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
