First, I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, then I would give it -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, but that this is a very bad film. Everything from the story, to the guidance, to editing is terrible. The story is not even halfway to an appropriate start (you can not expect much because it is based on a video game, something I did not know about going to the movie) but the output and editing made it worse. The film cuts embarrassing points and moves to scenes that have nothing to do with previous scenes. Some, such as the fast sex scene in the middle, do not understand their position in the story and see how the characters do not show any feelings toward each other. You can go to this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay for watching this movie, you will lose your money and if you do not pay anything, you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. So prefer yourself and do not see him.
