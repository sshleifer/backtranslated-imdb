Watch this movie? I thought to myself, what a lot of garbage. These girls must have brain boulders even to agree to be part of them. A waste of time watching it, hired only dim heavens. The representation was below standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone thinking of watching this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. I'm a real movie, this is worse than the Green Tomato Attack. <br /> <br /> I just hope this piece of garbage does not cost much. It would have been better to spend money on displaced people in the world. I hope there will be no pipeline supplement.
