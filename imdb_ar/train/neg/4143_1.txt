As I and the other half of my fans were horrified by the garbage, we could not resist producing a movie that contained all the great ones we were so excited about! However, for a 2004 film with cover from Freddy Vs Jason, it's a shame! The worst movie I have ever seen, but worth looking for laughter if you are able to watch it! <br /> <br /> Representation has terrible effects ... well, I can do better on my camcorder in fact it is very bad that they just bothered to put make-up on the zombie faces and leave the neck and hands and so on. There is no story line, memories of strange memories meaningless and terrible text! <br /> <br /> "I broke my teeth!" from one vampire "I broke my cigar" was the response of the man who looked like Jesse's uncle from the Dukes crossed with Santa!
