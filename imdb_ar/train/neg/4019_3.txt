Dakota (1988) was another vehicle from the early Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie is similar to the Harley movie that was later released. There are some differences but both are the same. I do not know which one came first. I think it will remain one of the secrets of life. But both are "troubled" children trying to change their place. Instead of cycling this involves horses. They are basically the same movie and both are cheesy. If you are L.D.P. A serious fan then I recommend that you see them both. You can get some extreme tuning and sorting from L.D.P. If you are playing a game, go to it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except L.D.P. Fans !!!
