This movie was very bad, it was funny. I could not resist watching it though. The plot is standard, acting very horrible (supporting cast like neighbor and friend lawyer were the best actors). Kind of fun if you have some time to waste it and want to see the conclusion into a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The headlines that played Cathy were great only because I could not determine whether her influential career was consistently affecting bad surgery or simply bad behavior (she decided it was both). This leaves the text for comment, which was very terrible. Pat notes, stupid decisions, and reckless stupidity by every character in the film. Maybe this is what installation was. I do not know, I do not know. I've just seen it to see how bad it is. (In fact, the dialog box can not yet be considered "clich√©" - but it is almost completely invalid.) <br /> <br /> All in all, a very bad, cheap film. The groups, the same scenes (house, building) were repeatedly shown without any art or actual work association; more like props thrown randomly at work in a bad game. It was possible to photograph a chase scene by any event in a warehouse or in an old school: shooting badly, cheap props, minimal movement ... and I still want to see the end. Go and conclude.
