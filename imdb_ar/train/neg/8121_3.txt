time is precious. This film is not. I must learn to ignore critics who are interested in small films such as Fargo and this is a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the film that critics are interested in? What a piece of waste! <br /> <br /> Link this movie is the rising black daughter looking for a family of white trash and find it. get it? <br /> <br /> The acting is great. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, groups, editing, sound) is about two steps above the 60 minute story. The characters are shallow and not smart. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not know each other what was clearly visible to the public; the audience was complaining on the screen what the characters should say afterwards. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed playing laundry more.
