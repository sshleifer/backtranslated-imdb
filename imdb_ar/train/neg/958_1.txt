How did this become a big turnout? Dear God I do not know where to start why I sucked this film too much. The film was expected and there was no authenticity. The only thing I can admire is the representation of some characters. The film was very bright, and they should have done something with lighting, for example. Make the environment darker. Make Make Up On Some Dead Characters This movie looks like a horror flick of 1970. This is 2006! People are not afraid of other people wearing heavy make-up. Most horror scenes we took from Hollywood movies or other Asian horror movies. Total rip off! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason why a lot of people scream while watching this movie is the match. How many times do we have to copy the scenes from The Ring and improve them instead of the girl coming out of the TV, do you come now from the window next door? No matter how you put it out, it still rip off. If you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movies listed on this site.
