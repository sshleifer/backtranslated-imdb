Soldier Blue is a provocative film: pretending to be a kind of profound statement about the human inhumanity of man, the exploitation of the white man and his brutality towards the indigenous peoples; an unrelenting and cynical comment on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but it failed miserably to be any of these things. Soldier Blue is in fact a malignant slag, tacky, very bad, unsafe. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head, saying it appeared to be a mix of two completely different films. What is essentially a strange "passing stranger" love story, cliched, and ill-behaved - Strauss and Pergen to overcome their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and fall in love (ah, bless) - reserved by two sick altars who had not left the place. The vulgar flick of Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the sinister, oil-filled climax, in which innocent little Native American children are shot, cut, cut, cut in love, and close-up, and big-breasted American mothers are harassed, raped, and tied - no Excuse me, this except the box office. (The massacre itself, while repulsive in its misplaced intent, is organized and shot; a group of actors lie around them with a light red paint smudged on them, overlapping with a few head-ripping / chipping effects - incidentally, (Now that's what I call exploitation.) <br /> <br /> Forget all the videos I have heard (including the absurd comments that begin and end in the film) about this "protest", condemning American brutality towards peoples This film does not give things about the plight of Cheyenne In fact, what we get is the silly romance of Bregan and Strauss in the white bread (the bad actors, at least in this), with lots of blood and courage And the broken heads that are thrown to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> Which is a terrible shame, because there is a film that will result from the Sand Creek massacre and all the massacres of real life in which the United States (Britain and all "civilized" countries) Pods (Iraq?). This is just not the film.
