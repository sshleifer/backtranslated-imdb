And a few "no" on top of it. The Voodoo Academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is it trying to do? Tell A Story? It is clear that not, as has been pointed out, most of them are just legal men who are barely self-reliant. Is it possible, then, to be an attempt to pass on homosexuality? Well, perhaps, if not for the sake of truth, they never go beyond the harmless, non-irritating forms of male communication. (Which I am happy to repeat about eighty thousand times). Well, it's a horror film; are you trying to scare us? Not unless the director intends to do so through full boredom and emptiness "for his work". <br /> <br /> I never enjoyed a movie in my life. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I have ever seen. It looks like the Voodoo Academy takes a variety of horror, comedian and gay films, puts it in a mill, then runs it through the coffee filter - just as a kind of coffee that filters coffee beans. It's the kind that takes everything vital, An interesting form. The result is 74 minutes of all-exciting movie like a glass of warm water - just without the ability to moisturize you after the 10-day jinn binge that will inevitably catch you if you see this abomination of human effort.
