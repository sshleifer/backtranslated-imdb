I had great hopes in this film because I loved the original much. It seems that Disney is trying to master the art of crappy sequences directly to the DVD. They deserve Razi. Several, in fact. I thought the idea was worth it, but the music was very bad and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music that Disney used to watch? Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, King of the Lion ... even Hercules and Hunbak of Notre Dame. They have made so many great films over the years that it is really sad that they have drowned in reference to producing consequences that are not good enough to put them in the theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not an indication of things coming to Walt Disney.
