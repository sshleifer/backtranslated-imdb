It is unfortunate that someone decided to separate from the best horror films of all time in my book. This weak version steals a lot of material from the first three films that reach to the extent of how people die and what will happen in the future to the main characters and basically try to cram three movies into one film and fail. It fails even to create a good, scary atmosphere for anyone (except for the odd exception where the wonderful choral music brings back memories of old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can thank is that there was not an omen.
