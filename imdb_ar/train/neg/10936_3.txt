I wanted to love this movie, I really did. I've got some good actors but in the end it's flat. It's very hard to be funny in some places (the girls because of the enthusiastic cooking attempts), the tributaries elsewhere (the scene where you clean someone's yard, so agree to join the team) and have some interesting scenes, while, All work scene). I did not find that the "bad guys" feared or deserved hatred, as much as they found them childishly annoying. <br /> <br /> I met people like them in the movie while playing the church ball. I will say that the rulers are in place, but in the end, I did not care much about personalities or their quest for the glory of the Church. Perhaps because they were all one-dimensional, which I probably did not think much about if the movie was more entertaining or seemed to be flowing a little more smoothly. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm have made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
