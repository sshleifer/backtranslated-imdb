Small boogers look silly that spawn foam and reproduce themselves. So far the horror elements of this film. All the rest of MUNCHIES shows like a truly backward comedy and this is very stupid and you will not find it funny after 15 minutes. I can imagine that young children are cheering for these small boogers, but adults will be left with only those "smart" references supposed to translate into things on the screen like Captain Kirk's entries from STAR TREK, the most famous scene of ET, a stark statement from filmmakers "Look! We are taking advantage of the success of GREMLINS here!" A cardboard cut from Clint Eastwood tells us ... What about his western movies exactly? I lost my last time ... oh yeah, and it seems that getting rid of chemical waste in the caves is bad. I do not know where they got the idea. <br /> <br /> To say that MUNCHIES is the most mysterious film, so. It's really really, really stupid. If you can break a smile while watching it, you may feel stupid because you did it after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Bad good? Yes, but only if "dumb", "backward" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, ohm, 6/10.
