Eitan Fox, while generally leaning alongside Israeli policy advocates, has made several interesting films in the past, such as "Walking on the Water" and simply the wonderful film "Yossi & Jagger." However, in the film "Bubble", follow this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Instead of giving this movie a warm welcome, the people who came to the show quietly got up and left. I also left quietly, I am outraged by a monotonous monotonous film and translate self-preservation as racist retaliation, racist bullying (and terrorism) as the outburst of justified anger; this implies that the Arabs misunderstand them by the evil Israelis so they act angrily at A constant stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worth the money you paid for the ticket (in fact, I was thinking of asking for my money back), and it was essentially an Israeli euphoria for the Palestinian film Paradise Now. If you want to be hostile to Israel, then watch this movie by all standards, because it really justifies such a dogmatic system. The fact that this film is made by an Israeli director, and even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a disgrace. In fact, how can it surprise Israel to be considered a pariah state when the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda and beggars. <br /> <br /> What a terrible shameful movie.
