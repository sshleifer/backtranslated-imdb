I'm very impressed with Jenna Jameson, but this movie is terrible. At that time, Geena Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and was the director of the film and Gina was the leading film star at all. Of course, Brad Gennie tried a lot of money by producing this big-budget pornography. Now I know why they do not make big budget budget movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars can act, but this is the real world and they can not act. That's why there are porn stars, if there is a beautiful woman like Jenna can act, she would try to go to mainstream movies instead of pornography. Just because your beauty does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Tracy Lourdes, when she was a teenager to her twenties, she was one of the most beautiful women on earth. I moved to mainstream films with low budget and could not represent. where is she now? I gave him 2 instead of just one because Jenna is too hot, but there are better films made then "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, do not want to hear you talk, as much as we want to see sex. Also, you are Gina, you will have a lot of fans and more money in your bank account if you have done anal in the movie.
