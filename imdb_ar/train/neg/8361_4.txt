-SPOILES- Lame south of the border adventure film related to extortion by chief executive Rosenlski, president of Unasco, through Ziegler's motivation, David Ziegler, who lives in Reilly or Ziegler's home in Cancun, Mexico. He has this CD, presented to his brother James, who has three years of telephone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal deals. This CD has given David an advantage over the international gangs that haunt him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James has become a little greedy by trying to get rid of Rosenlski for 2 million diamonds has not only cost him his life, but has also put David at risk of losing it. Ropsenlski wants to negotiate with David on the CD by making his ex-wife Liz talk to him about giving up, holding Rosnelski a deal to pay off her debts if they come through. David was later killed by the Mexican Toni Roslinsky, with the help of a large white shark, who does not apply all these peaceful deals by his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony took the CD left by Liz to his boss at a safe local hotel and now wants to kill James, as David did, while keeping the CD to get something about Rosenzlowski. <br /> <br /> David, who was secretly hiding James's diamond at the time of his death, is now a target for Tony and his men to close it forever. David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that the CD that David lost but later used, without knowing Rosenlski who was behind him to blackmail him. <br /> <br /> "Night of the Sharks" contains a number of shark attacks using this massive white-eyed shark that ends up bringing out about half a dozen crew members, including Tony. David, who firmly believes in gun control, uses high-explosive knives and Molotov cocktails, as well as fists, to pull out the entire Tony crew. Even the killer shark ended up by Tony but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it comes to the use of firearms to save his friend and friend Baku, his girlfriend Juanita and his father priest Mattia of Tony live, and his bandits were banned with David; he had more than a knife and a man's spear and then anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was about to come to an end as you could with David believed to have been killed by the shark with the eyes later coming out of the crowd, after Rosenski was convinced he had died and left the village. David continues his life as a free and life-loving living creature with no one looking to kill him and the wealth of two million dollars. David is credited with making his friend Baku return to Rosenski his CD, but under these circumstances, if something happens to him, Rusnelski, who does not know where and where, will shoot his big mouth and tell the whole world about his dirty and criminal dealings.
