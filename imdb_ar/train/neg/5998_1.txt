The basic formula of the original series was: Take someone, make the audience like them, then put them in mortal danger. This formula worked on the 32 episodes that took place between 1964-1968. <br /> <br /> Now, we have jumped 40 years forward until 2004 .. We have known Alan Tracy, a child in a college college less than an effort, with his friend, Fermat, a young man who knows everything. She was caught by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise of the Tracy family for school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kierano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults go to save John from the Thunderbird 5 who has been damaged by a sporadic accident. This is part of The Hood's plot to capture Tracy Island so he can steal Thunderbird devices ... <br /> <br /> ?? To steal a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is lame like it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is normal, and it behaves more like a wooden object than a fiberglass, antiquity, and anything other than Hans Zimmer's score ??? There was little subject of Barry Gray's glorious shone during Zimmer's dull synchronization. The rest of the result was a prominent forget. In fact, part of the result was broadcast the next week on the radio and did not recognize it! I did not have to stay until I saw the modest Busted efforts with the final titles <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked well with Parker, he and Sophia Miles when Penelope looked lost. With proper materials, they can be display stoppers. The CGI's work was what I would call the leading edge - 5 years ago. The dynamics of the main vehicle were wrong; at least the original chain models moved as if they were mass. <br /> <br /> Another painful point is that the entire production looks like one long set of product positions, From each vehicle manufactured by Ford to full content was Fraser Tracy produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) has the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and "Clockstoppers", which directly targets his age group, has added nothing to Thunderbirds legend. When Star Trek came to the big screen in 1979, "The Motion Picture," a whole new life was revived in the franchise that lasted for 20 years or so. With this movie, Frakes missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the franchise of Thunderbirds. <br /> <br /> I expect that this movie, like "The Avengers" and "Saint" before it, will sink into mystery within 6 months, leaving the original series to its "classic" position.
