A large part of the scenes must be cut. There are lots of scenes that should have been cut. For example, the scene where fishermen mention "I got spiders on my penis," or "I love your dick," or play in a mud scene, or a bar scene where the main function of dinocroc diners is a freak. <br /> <br /> What about the other unruly scenes that show a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to her boyfriend who walks like he is wearing three-size panties for women too small. During their love, did not they realize that they are doing next to the little boy who will soon escape and lose his head? Why did they do in the living room? I mean his head really turned over. What about the beach scene reminds us of Stephen Spielberg's jaws at Grant Lake. All these exotic scenes can easily be renamed as comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my local city, movie theaters have been announcing Dinocroc for months, and I'm glad I did not see it because I later discovered that it only appeared for a day or two before it was canceled. The film was bad. I thought Dinocroc was not a good looking film in preview. Featuring a Dinocroc leg that looks like a kid wearing a green pajamas and slippers with claws and walking up and down like a two-year-old. Can be easily transmitted to children geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any film-maker wants to know what should not be done, this is a real classic trash game. Like Diane's friend, who walks like an advanced syphilis, you wonder what a poor woman sees in this man who seems drunk even before he drinks beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? Man looked more interesting trousers than the whole Dinocroc film. His behavior was so bad, he makes a much better alternative to Mr. Bean. Move over Rowan Atkinson, here's a man who has a better comedic talent in the flick of science fiction. Probably the worst casting in the history of Hollywood.
