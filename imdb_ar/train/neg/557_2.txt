It's hard to believe that after waiting 14 years, we finished this film junk. The original version was very exciting and thrilling that earned a "cult" status showing the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This movie adds nothing, offers nothing, and ends up in the big box of failed sequences. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could have led to an interesting array of plot developments using a highly talented qualified crew. Unfortunately, we dealt with a 90-minute thesis in a life immersed in Catherine Tramel's self ... or is it Sharon Stone. It is likely to be a combination of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is also to see a continuation of sex-erotic attraction as in "B.S.1", her femininity. Get rid of the soft boredom that ultimately supports the old saying that women can be more attractive in clothes than getting out. It is interesting to note that Charlotte Rampling was walking around her body, via GEORGY GIRL in 1966, when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress with great experience in carrying her up here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie lover, you should watch and control this movie using your own rating system. If this is not the case, you may also wait for a DVD to be released in the "workbook", "unclassified", "compilers" or "absolute" versions, and perhaps within 14 years we will be full of "Basic" Instinct 3 " Stone is 62 years old and no one will really care.
