Anyone who visited drivers in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s should watch a movie or two with American International Pictures, a distributor of the 1980s giant Cannon Films. Wherever the filmmakers ventured, AIP will be there to provide them with the latest feature titles - in the 1950s horror films such as "Voodoo Woman" and "Undead" appeared. In the 1960s, the beach comedy of Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello and motorcycle fountains, such as "The Glory Stompers". In the 1970s, AIP took out trash at mills such as Cannibal Girls and Sugar Hill. <br /> <br /> "Dillinger", released in 1973, is one of AIP's most high-profile efforts to capture the true spirit of filmmaking; it is one of those asymmetrical clicks that satisfy the public's thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense. In general, Dillinger is typical of its age: amusing and worth a few hours, but definitely memorable. "Dillinger," which was heavy in motion and short in both reality and acting, was an honest effort by the director of the John Millius scenario ("Magnum Power") but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career. <br /> <br /> The 109-minute "Dillinger" - an epic of the AIP - follows FBI chief Milvin Borvis's attempt to win the Oscar-winning Ben Johnson. Purvis, the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in an ambush in Kansas City in 1933, helped gangster Frank Nash escape justice. In general, the men who planned the breakthrough, including banking expert John Delinger (Warren Oates), Britti Boy Floyd (Steve Canale), and mentally ill Pep Weiss Nelson (Richard Dreyfus). Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking Homer Van Mater (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Perpont (Jeffrey Lewis). He is also hooked with Billy Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a whore of French and Indian extraction. During his several months in 1933-4, Dillinger is essentially a hunt, with Purvis's footnote looking to run and kill the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> "Dillinger" has a documentary sensation, listing dates and places while Johnson presents a loose account named Purvis. Milius retains the appearance of true depression, using authentic costumes, cars, weapons and buildings; he also sprinkles on black and white photography and stock shots from gang shooting. The film is never boring, moving at a rapid pace, albeit random. The scenes of the movement represent Dillinger's power point, effectively edited by Fred Feitshans Jr in his latest professional effort. Thousands of empty ammunition must be used to make this film, not to mention a pound of explosives. This film is certainly not good, as people get shot and fall everywhere. Violence, though unjustified, brings some understanding of the chaos caused by organized crime in American life. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not exceed the mode of exploitation never, because the required writing does not exist. John Meles, a bit overrated as a director, puts a lot of emphasis on work. The scenes of the movement (mostly bloody shootings) are impressive and can be compared to any major crime film of its time, including the 1967 film "Bonnie and Clyde." But we simply do not know much about Dillinger and members of his gang as people; The vital relationship that developed between Dillinger and Frechette, where the couple meet in a bar during one scene and walk around as loved ones after only ten minutes. Melvin Bourvis seems to be walking in and out of the story, becoming a prominent figure only when Mehlis needs to prevent the film from collapsing. Often, the film takes a personal shot when it is possible to explore his characters in detail. <br /> <br /> Besides, the main crime in the picture is ignorance of historical truth. While many say that "Dillinger" is just a film, films like this film that creates myths and makes them permanent. Those with a history of gangs will point out that John Delinger was not the last episode of his death, as we are encouraged by the Meles movie scenario and the documentary style. In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Bibi Nelson and Homer van Mater. It was also said that he did not carry a gun on the night of his death, nor did Billy Frechette. Although these errors may lead to high drama, there is no reason why Mehlis can stay with the facts and write a wonderful story around her. <br /> <br /> The performance of Warren Oates because Dillinger is very good, although sometimes it seems unconvincing. Oates is a sense of humor and portrays how Delinger has become a consumer of his image of life in the American press; yet we never feel the danger he has raised in his life. Ben John gives some life to Pepez, in a tone but somewhat flat. Michelle Phillips brings passion to the character of Billy Frechette, which is really very bad that the Meles movie scenario did not explain her relationship with Delinger. We never learn what drew it to a cold-blooded killer, unlike the stereotype of an easy-to-get-at-risk girl. Supporting roles with Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis and Cloris Leachman which appear for a short time are acceptable to these talents. <br /> <br /> As a piece of the 1970s, "Dillinger" seems to be doomed to retail boxes, exactly where the MGM version of a DVD was picked up for $ 4.99. The movie is well presented in widescreen (must-click driving) with subtitles in French and Spanish. The Dillinger Trailer is provided as a single single play. Largely forgotten only by gangster movie lovers and driving enthusiasts, the film does not really call for anything else in the way of supplementary material. For lovers of this genre, it is certainly worth checking. <br /> <br /> ** of 4 <br /> <br /> Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
