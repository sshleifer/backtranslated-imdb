I will not argue with anyone who describes this film as impressive, as with the performance of January Jones, but please check it, if you have not already, in the AMC TV series "Mad Men", which starts later on the month. As is the case with the entire staff. I will assume that she took the role of "taboo" firmly for money, and realized what was a terrible mess, performed a little representation task to avoid famine. You know if this is the case, but I (now) know for certain that they can act. <br /> <br /> At first, I saw the taboo, I was convinced that her flat hand was a smart choice that would later lead to some important revelation about her character or conspiracy. No such luck. It is hard to believe that the director did not suggest at least once that not to change the expression of 17 consecutive scenes can cause a locksmith. <br /> <br /> Ironically, her winning performance in "Mad Men" as a character, at least in her early appearances, is highly repressed, preserved and uncertain, and somewhat colorless, no different from her "taboo" role. But as the television series progressed, she began to thrive on someone questioning my mother's role in her traditional 60-year-old book. You can not wait to figure out where to take her character in the second season. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "taboo" like leprosy, but definitely check out "Mad Men".
