I saw this film when it was first released in 1978, when I was a high school student. I took a date to see it. Needless to say "I did not get anything" because the film was so bad! The career of Joan Rivers did not swing as badly as it deserved after making this terrible nonsense. In fact, it is not a strange term enough: this movie is funny! You walk outside like any laughter you might have beaten before that happens. This is not worth attention out of curiosity, or any feeling that it is "very bad, it's good." Not even the gang in MST3K has made it worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's life survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
