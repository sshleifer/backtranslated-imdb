This film began with some aspects of the plot, then abandoned it to an endless series of random characters and confrontations that had nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain involved in this film. This film is a very cynical pile of trash made by some people who have animation skills but who lack the ability to create or be able to tell stories. It's a very bad effort coming from a large studio. Obviously there are moral problems and motivations in Disney, not to mention the total lack of quality control and control. This administration allowed this film to see the daylight that speaks volumes about incompetence and despair. This film joins the list of "Worst Films Ever".
