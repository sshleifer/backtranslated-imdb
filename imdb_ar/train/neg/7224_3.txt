The movie stays gray for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, as a result many strange sequences seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way stories are told, they become only strange and incomprehensible to watch them. It's kind of forcing me to watch the movie again but I can not do it. I watched this movie in the morning, and I'm sure that if I watched this movie in the evening, I was asleep. For me, the film was like a "Blade Runner" for a poor man. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves a lot of questions and possibilities. It makes the film leave a meaningless and non-permanent impression. <br /> <br /> And the strange appearance of the film does not help much. The film is half the reality of CGI / half real life but the half is not finished good, impressive, stunning and imaginative as for example will be the case in subsequent films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even created half the characters of the film by computer, which seemed like a very strange and strange choice, keeping in mind that the animation of the character does not look very impressive. Certainly, the future environment is still good-looking, and it is clear that the film was not cheap, but its style in essence and in this case is not really positive. <br /> <br /> Some fonts are also very appalling and uninteresting. The main god of the film says consistently lines like; "I will do this but I do not care why I want to do so." It's just not saying anything at all Mr. Horus! It's annoying and it's easy to put a movie in fact, if you do not bother explaining anything about the plot. The deeper questions and meanings of the film are also mixed into his film and text collection. <br /> <br /> Representatives are still doing their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about it. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from original. It is a rip of many classic and semi-classic films, mostly from modern science fiction films. Maybe that's also why the film made a big impression on me. <br /> <br /> An unsuccessful and interesting film experience. <br /> <br /> 3/10
