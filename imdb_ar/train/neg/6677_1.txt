After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very passionate about this film. But it's really a terrible movie, the total time you see the foreigner is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a cheap thriller), and the film is the top story, boy, what story? <br /> <br /> The story does not seem to be moving in the direction of first-time foreigners (after 7 years!), then do not know what to do with them (after 7 years?) and even want to launch it (why the hell have they taken over? on him?). Then you want the friend, who acts the most, to get away from this madness, then suddenly do not do it, then again, do, then do not do it. They then concluded that killing a foreigner would kill the entire human race (and remember that in all those years no one else had seen these permanent aliens) and what did they do? They torture him and blow up a handful of foreigners for peace. <br /> <br /> This is my first evaluation on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person and do not write soon, so listen to my warning: This step is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
