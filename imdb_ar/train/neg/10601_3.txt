This is the official supplement to the '92 Sci-Fi Thriller movie. Originally, Van Damme was among the many veterinarians killed in the Vietnam War to become ideal soldiers (Unisols). At this time, I think, after about ten years, because Van Dam has a daughter about this age. Is now working with the government in a secret installation process to train the latest Unisols - named Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, there is something wrong: the supercomputer (named Seth - like the snake in "King Cobra" in the same year) - became crazy, led Unisols, and even downloaded the computer mind to the super body Unisol (Jay White). We look at the next step in evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's battles with one particularly means Unisol (the professional wrestler Goldberg) whom Comin continues only: removing him from a building - not good; running around with a truck - do not go! Shoot him and burn him - I forgot! A lot of humor is being traced about how Van Damme is now bypassed and categorized (until it turns gray around the edges). But although he takes the dreaded, he continues to kick him! Most of the sequences of this kind are pretty lame - a pale imitation of the original origins, and although this genre is certainly not a genius blow, it is only able to be amused constantly, especially if you are a wrestling fan.
