A terrible film made with a budget of about $ 9.99. Use very clear mini-sets, misrepresentation and an awful story about foreigners using abandoned meat from the butcher's shop as fuel for their own space ship. The film contains some blood (not enough to disturb him) and a personality with an egg racket replaces one of his hands. (Yes, I read it correctly.) <br /> <br /> The saving grace was a song made in "Talent Show" (how ridiculous?) By a new / spoiled wave band I think was called "Rocket Looks Otherwise, this is not worth your time, not even at the level of "Too bad it's good." See if you're in weird foreign films, but anyone else should get away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 Of 10
