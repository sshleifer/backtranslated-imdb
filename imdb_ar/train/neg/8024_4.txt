While sitting to watch the 14th season of the bachelor's ("On the Wings of Love"), I learned that I would have a good time. I had seen some of the previous chapters of the Bachelor's in transit; watching a loop or two and losing the next three or so. I find that bachelor's are often attractive and interesting, although their quality and morals are mostly absent. <br /> <br /> Details of "The Wings of Love" Details of the trip by Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, true love as one can find in the dramatic dating show on Season. Jake meets 25 beautiful girl from all over the country. It starts to get to know them a little, but it's mostly superficial; to what extent can you recognize someone in a few 5-minute conversations? Jake tries to make his real intentions known from the beginning, at least to the public. He pointed out that he does not want only love or time, but wants a penance or a wife. We can only assume that he explained this to women in the competition as well. If this is the case, it may explain, to some extent, some of the woman's actions. Women are super competitive. Although they do not yet know Jake at all, they are still inside to win them regardless of the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only were women competitors, they were also confident and generous. Threats, stabbing and warnings of "watch out!" All show that these women have not been there for a good time either. Jake noticed that he was not only looking for sex appeal, but was looking for a "touch". However, the girls withdrew all attempts to try to convince Jake of the sexual appeal. Arrived at the palace in tights? Either low or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seem to be feeling comfortable, others have missed that note altogether. One girl, Chaney, noticed that Jake "a good young man" could be a "naughty girl". She said Jake could land on her "runway at any time". I felt a flattery from the other girls because of her provocative statement that showed their interest in these positions. <br /> <br /> So, realistic dating can not be so bad, can it? Along with the obvious issue of sex attraction, there are other issues that spoil this seemingly innocuous offer. Is this the right way to find a companion in the future? Compete for someone's attention by bragging oneself to extreme dimensions? But unfortunately, this is what America has reduced these days: fun and sex without a little commitment and happiness from the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment to which many girls are committed. Themselves to Jake. Some girls in particular seem to be overly linked. "If I do not get that first impression, it'll kill me," said one girl. As we mentioned before, they do not know him yet and she was talking about a certain rose, not just one of the fifteen roses that should be avoided. <br /> <br /> Michel, in particular, seems to have some issues with Jake. Other girls also noticed that. After Michele's own explosion, Vienna confirmed that Michelle was suffering from a "mental breakdown and that we were here only for an hour." Michelle got another rose from the evening on premiere ?? Missing the judiciary? He was very passionate about it. Other girls thought it was ridiculous. Another girl cried too, but she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> I started with the survivor, and from there, took off? reality TV. This shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we do not see offers and give them good ratings, networks will not continue to run. The only logical conclusion to be drawn is that enough of America is addicted to drugs. One thing is clear: America (in general) likes reality television and its aftermath. <br /> <br /> This begs the question: Why do we even love Reality TV? What is it that directs us? Is it because we see similarities in our lives, or because we want to make sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever it attracts us to, we must be wary of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all the TV programs are actually bad. However, I say we need to evaluate each one. <br /> <br /> Episodes used in criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2.
