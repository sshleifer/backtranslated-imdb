Well, we all love Dzi Dukes, but what's up in this film. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is no one country for this girl, Daisy was not dizzy! Perhaps Uncle Jesse was the closest to the original. Not an insult to Bert, but I never noticed that Boss Hogg was too long. That was part of the humor of Boss Hogg and it was his size. Have they tried someone like Danny Devito?!? Well, now I get this cast Jessica Simpson do you take a look at her husband? It matches Luke Duke to the tee !!!!!! Clarey these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen never existed on the dukes !! This made the movie turn off from the start. I give this huge thumb down.
