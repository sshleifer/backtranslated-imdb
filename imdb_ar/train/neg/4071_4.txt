A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother was jailed for being a partner, but he quickly ran away. When escaping, the man who appears to be innocent is kidnapped by three victims and soon lures his girlfriend into the plot. If this is not bad enough, this situation will quickly lead to a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good aspects and many bad aspects. Her strongest side was the main actress Emily Hack. If you set aside the fact that she is naked in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong personality. I see no reason why they can not use this experience and somehow convert it into a career in one way or another. I was convinced that she was a ruthless individual. <br /> <br /> Also, the makers of this film were very bold and did not dare to drill. Graphic nudity (male and female), pharynx, and severe anal violence are not avoided. I like my horror movies to go a little too far, and this film has completely ignored it, and skipped happily towards Gomora. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows it. I can excuse it - the plot was decent, and it behaved well and in some scenes, making the film the least quality of the film was actually more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). Therefore, I will not tweak them because of the presence of low quality equipment. What I'll be using is the bad choices in the stills. For no reason I can be sure (besides pumping the film), there is a large amount of footage from the cemetery. I do not really know why, and frankly started to back down at this point because it was too long and meaningless. <br /> <br /> I'm also having trouble with the title. The idea here was to deceive people into believing that the film had something to do with the classical classic "I Spit on Your Grave." Now, there is a line that seems to be the main character is the daughter of the woman of this other film. The themes are the same loose (woman retaliates men). But there is no fixed connection and the reason for choosing this title is that the video store customer thinks they are getting a relay. This was deceitful and deceitful. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plot is meaningless. Not even a little. A woman was initially killed for no reason. A fugitive finds time to kidnap people for torture, for no reason (because they wronged his girlfriend?). The man himself moves from good to evil without explanation. Similarly, the female bullet (Haack) is transformed from an ordinary person into a cruel and sadistic person, for no reason at all, and against those who are often marginalized (the neighbor who provides drugs for sex is wrong, but in no way deserves to be tortured) . <br /> <br /> Do not let this title fool you or pretend that the movie is incredibly horrifying. Yes, some scenes were appalling, but the vast majority of the movie is boring and makes you want to take a nap. If you see this in your video store or on Netflix, continue browsing. Or rent it, we can sit and vent on it for hours. You have been warned.
