When you have an unbroken skull, an empty palace, a schizophrenic wife, a farmer and a nanny, throw a minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP response to insomnia. br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" gets points for daring, offering free crates to anyone who dies from fear of watching the movie. A completely safe bet when you get excited by people who believe they are producing a movie "Suspens for Dummies." <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a cutie, anyway. She had a few good moments of acting here and there (especially when trying to communicate with a gardener) and no one fills a nightgown like her. But this scary face makes it - scary in itself. Stop. <br /> <br /> As a whole, though, there is little thrill here and everything is telegraphed like a pun intended by silent acting. You can not be afraid of this film, it's impossible. I have her moments, but not enough of them. <br /> <br /> However, thanks to some Mike Nelson and his fellow Robots, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the version they got ("The movie jumped, it was really scary!"). <br /> <br /> One star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half years after the release of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Talk about bear "scream" ....
