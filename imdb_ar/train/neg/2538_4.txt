Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox produced many of Mr Moto's films. However, at the end of the series, the studio was obviously "jumping shark", so to speak. This term indicates that a television program has exceeded its peak, and the responsible executives have decided to activate the program by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with The Brady Bunch, Cousin Oliver and Ties Family introduced a strange six-year-old in just one season! With Moto movies, they jumped out of sharks by offering comic relief because they thought these smart films needed to be reused. In the previous film, Warren Heimer played a troublesome wrestler. The film features Archibald Featherstone. Featherstone may be one of the most disturbing examples of comic relief ever, as you keep hoping that someone (preferably Moto) will kill him just to close it !! Although he was supposed to work in the famous Scotland Yard, it shows all the intelligence and acumen that has been damaged by the turnips. Again and again, his scenes were lively and unnecessary, and Peter Laurie looked painfully standing as he watched this clown "act". It's so bad that it really destroys what could have been one of Moto's best movies because of his clever plots. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the Queen of Sheba crown was discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now an international policeman more than the moral character he was originally, was ready to protect the precious piece from theft. In a wonderful twist, many thieves try to steal the crown independently of each other. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is viewable, but it is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here. As the Second World War approached, movies could not survive any longer anyway, because getting a sympathetic Japanese figure simply would not be acceptable in the United States or its allied countries.
