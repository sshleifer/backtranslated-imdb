A family looking for some old attractions on the side of the road to include in the father's coffee table book a strange old-fashioned show run by an eccentric man. When the family car collapses when they leave the side-view, they are forced to stay in an almost deserted fishing camp that was the site of a prison sentence decades ago. <br /> <br /> There were many films in the horror "Strange", ranging from Todd Browning's "Freaks" (1932) to Alex Winter (1993). Both are classic (or soon with Freaked). "Xu side", however, will never be. And if it does not reach the classic mode ever. . . Well, it will be a clear indication of the sad state of our kind. From the cynical opening song to the 17-year-old daughter, who is bigger than her natural mother, the film did not have much success. The writing was subpar, but not quite awful. . . Just boring. The trend was weak, and the rare effects were very rare and unreasonable. The deep representation and casting was worse. Anyone who believes that the age of these teenagers in the age of the camp should not meet a teenager for a long time. There was not enough injustice and violence to make up for the lack of any other quality. . . When there was little violence, it was not good at all. I can not forget to mention the scenes of the end of the fighting, which was, honestly, the worst I've ever seen in a movie. In general, this horror film is easy to forget and weak worth to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar box. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
