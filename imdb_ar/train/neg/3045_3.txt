Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought from Walgreens for every big dollar. I'm still not sure whether the dollar has been well spent or foolishly wasted. <br /> <br /> An impressive array of designs and costumes. It seems that a lot of thought and effort went into making it. The set of designs is very Mexican in style. I loved them so much. Santa is impressive. One of the most impressive Santas in moviedom. <br /> <br /> I think the original intent and purpose of this film is to be something of a delight and delight for the children's audience. But, somehow, it comes across completely chaotic. In fact, I was left stunned by the extent of confusion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing may make it seem confusing and strange. One of the reasons for preferring the experience of films in the original language created and using English translation as dubbing often gives unintended oddity. At least the voices of children were called real children's voices rather than women who pretended to be children, and this tended to be a very strange voice. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing ballet in Longhawns? you did not? No I even watched this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie worth watching? Now, this is a toss. I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone because it is very annoying in its exotic way. However, the unintended strangeness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what to do. I dont ... to myself, it made me feel uneasy when I see devils doing the gentle ballet moves constantly. Now, this is just a mistake ...
