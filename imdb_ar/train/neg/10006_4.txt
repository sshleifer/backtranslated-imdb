I do not know who to blame, shy writers or ignorant director. It seems like one of those movies where large sums of money were paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon), where there is not enough left to make a film. This could have been very amusing, but there was a veil of shame, even cheese, which hung on every scene. Since he got the R rating anyway, why was the bubble bath scene being filmed everywhere with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleep through potential hot relationships with more than beautiful and exciting characters in the world? If they're just looking for laughter, why not throw Wobi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was very predictable, and I was surprised when I found out that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for viewers but also for actors.
