Devil Hunter earned a bad reputation because it is on the DPP "Video Nasty" list, but it is not necessarily. Many of the films in which the list is for God (and DPP) are only known causes, and while this is not the extravagance of a bunch. There is not much here to call for a ban ... It is shameful because I have never passed it because it is not in the Shopping List. The plot essentially gives the film a decent base - or at least a more decent base than most cannibals - and follows an actress who was kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. Then a hunter is hired to find her, but along the way he has to avoid the aborigines, led by a man who calls himself the "devil" (hence the title). The film basically only plods for eighty-five minutes and there are really many interesting scenes. It is a real shame that Jess Franco ends up making films like this because the man has a clear talent, as we have seen in films like The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy. Unfortunately, his good films are just jewels among piles. Of Crap And Devil Hunter A large part of the waste. I watched this movie purely because I want to be able to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (more than two other people to go!), And I think that's why most of the other people who watched the movie saw it. But if you are not looking for the bad guys; there really is no reason to bother with this one.
