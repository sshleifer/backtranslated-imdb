Today, I wrote this review in the fury of Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of our nation's darkest days. 911 changed everything. We have changed our concept of security. We have changed our understanding of human and human evil. More importantly and devastatingly, they changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not confirm how deeply repulsed and disillusioned and disillusioned Hollywood's ignorance of the neglected and arrogant that seeks to make a profitable profit from death and destruction. This film and those who love it should cause controversy in the midst of oral talk between filmmakers and critics alike. Certainly echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood sank to a new low. Even less than the bottom-down villains who have committed the most atrocities of brutality and relentless cruelty. Behind all that is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this film. How dare they not respect the memories of the families of the missing? How dare they mock the lives of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the failed towers on that fateful day of shame? How dare they try to defeat and benefit at the same time from a national tragedy in the mist of the world after 911 mourning and fatigue?!?!?! How dare they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the gall to think about seeing this morally depressing tragedy, I say it with all my might: remember. Think of that day and ask yourself whether you are a reasonable person or not. Think back to that day, and ask yourself whether this film is a disgrace to the lives that were lost that day. Think back to that day from the cry of their loved ones' families. Consider returning to that day of lost lives on these two planes. Consider returning to the additional carnage caused by the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a spirit. <br /> <br /> Think. remember. I respect the memories of the Lost Lives in 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
