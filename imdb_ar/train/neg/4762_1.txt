I saw this movie knows nothing about it before. The plot was horrendous with large gaps of information missing. The film did not have the "intelligence battle" you feel me. The actors took their mouths out of their mouths, sometimes causing me to hurt my teeth while stabbing them. The plot was predictable, except for the turbulent sex scene in the stomach at the end (I'm not gay but I was physically made on my stomach), until the end was predictable. And you can tell that the detective was Good Lo in costume, everything from fake tone, terrible Sunni work, facial hair fashion shop, everything pointed out that it was disguised. The entire film felt like a wasted time in my life. This film had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Kane as a doll and a house as a window to watch the show, which really thrives in my opinion.
