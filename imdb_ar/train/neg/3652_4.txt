I watched this movie in DVD format. My version may have been affected, but I was disappointed because there was no screen on the DVD. I will say that the first reason for this film was Claire Furlani. While I would like to see her, I feel that she has not lived up to my expectations so far from her other films. I was actually equally pleased to see Arquin play a fun part. The two other actors I did not know very well, so I can not compare their performance, but they were a little fun. The representation is the only granular quality of this film in my opinion. The story line, while some can say a little convincing, lacks direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the text and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors to a certain extent, I recommend this film, but leave it alone.
