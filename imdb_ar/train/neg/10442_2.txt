All the Internet buzz aside, this movie was God awful. I expected the film to be a farce more than anything else. Instead, the filmmakers tried to produce a thriller / horror film, and they were completely missed. There were only a few good parts and good lines for the couple Samuel Jackson. Other than that, a bunch of bulls and some of the moving snakes were bad. All the Internet joking was better than the actual film in miles. Now that the film has already come out, we hope that this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of junk too much. If you're looking for something funny and fun, go to Snakes on a Blog.
