This film failed to explore the humanity of animals that left me feeling empty inside. [Spoiler forward] I was not convinced that d. De has really had a compelling reason to give up a big purchase deal to help his furry friends. While PIP (the original) went against big budget strikes by focusing on the human virtues of animals versus their human counterparts, not all the animals in this film were more than caricature cartoons that one would gladly make fun of in the meat grinder (even more so if One could understand meaningless chatter). Without the behavior of Eddie Murphy the adulterer, this film will be flop.
