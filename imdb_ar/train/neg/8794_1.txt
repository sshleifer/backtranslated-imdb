I have been puzzled by the reason why this film is impressive, not to mention the extreme respect, especially by many critics who are, otherwise, very reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one keyword that describes this film in essence - anger. <br /> <br /> The easiest example to explain is the use of the director - or, more accurately, the abuse - of music. In the first half, the tedious reggae is played almost three times (when often once). But in the second half, the Mommas and The Papas "California Dreamin" are played at least seven times, usually in the highest volume. Godsakes, whether you like the song or not in advance, will be completely sick from the end. Just think, some people claim they have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they have listened to the California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary redundancy (does not contribute anything in the story) can be excused if the rest of the The film has no merit, or if the story is involved in any way. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only side that I found loved is Bridget Lane's cargo around and still plays an invincible Asia in a raincoat. Even this has faded fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the high reputation that is not due to this film will convince many poor suckers to leave and see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you have not seen a movie before in Hong Kong before, do not start with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid seeing it at the cinema at any price. Quick and mute buttons are essential tools for staying here. <br /> <br /> You've been warned!
