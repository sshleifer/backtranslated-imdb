While most of the film is very amateurish, the slaughter scene is run kosher, but not true. The Koucher law says that the animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin. The scene of the slaughter of the kocher is accurate because anyone who knows who saw them or saw a beta movie shows a kosher slaughter, where the animals were cut off, and the esophagus was cut while he was still alive, conscious and clearly suffering. You must remember that history was written by the victors. Is it even allowed for anyone to think that the Nazis were probably right? <br /> <br /> Does not anything say that the Nazis banned this evil religious massacre, and the Jews still practice it today?
