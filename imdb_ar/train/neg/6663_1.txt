I can not stand this show! Have you ever been so single quality to recover, one funny punchline, or one line plot "no" making the ordinary viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of mendy corn flakes? <br /> <br /> Sounds. Oh, those terrible terrible sounds. Akin repeatedly pulls a set of fine cutlery through a dusty blackboard, each letter uniquely annoying in its ability to sing or sing nasal. Cosmo looks like an eccentric, Vicki looks like a typical fit, and Timmy's father shows every line like a bad swipe for a game host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> The animations are terrible. Even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" Laugh at the very bad artwork at this show. Each character has a buck teeth, or a square head, or a top three very large sizes for his body. What makes the characters talk about each particular line and smile broadly, as if to take a picture with the president? Then, there is the fact that every character in the show is a completely wrong game. Not since the grace of Amelia Piedlia, Homer Simpson, and Bodie to mourn the fame of Charles In Charge, where the characters were depicted as unreally stupid. The word "unrealistic" is often synonymous with the word "deceptive", which is certainly the case here. There has not been much of this thumb-based grudge since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... At least Leslie Nelson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (the same applies to each episode, so the spoiler is alerted at a great time here): Timmy wishes something for him with two "nice Oddparents", there is something wrong, there is always An agreed reason is that he can not reverse it immediately and get rid of the damage, and then everything turns out fine in the end. Oh, and in a side note, his parents did not believe Timmy when he complained to Vicky, and they continued to employ her at every opportunity. Maybe I just, but it seems that the children's presentation that contains a hidden message that it is pretty good not to know the abusive babysitter is probably not a great idea. <br /> <br /> If you write a paper and want to cite an example of how low the quality of the cartoons is, "The Fairly Odd Parents" should be a great place to start. A prime example of television producers assembling a worthless product that targets children without much effort or simply because they know someone is somewhere to see it.
