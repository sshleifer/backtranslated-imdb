Suffice it to say that - despite the absurd naivete of his unpretentious 'unpretentious' abilities published here - the director of this obnoxious and obnoxious tosh has never come out of a film since then. Well, this is excellent news as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the clarity of its origin, but lacks the intelligence and technical competence that makes Martin Ames the novelist readable. <br /> <br /> When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if it wants to regain its former status, it must stop producing such a waste and make something that people really want to see? <br /> <br /> Avoid like plague.
