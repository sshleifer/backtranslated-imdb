What a false story, blackmail murder, allegations of having sex with children, homosexuals and the Catholic Church ..... absolute intestines. How should most of the UK-based TV series sit, sitting mothers, etc., compulsive gays, who are now really tired. Everyone accepts that there are gay people in society only, and there are other minority groups, but we do not want to break our throats (I will order this) in every show. Apart from the above, the drama moved from what could have been an interesting little story to Pantomime, the priest was gay and there were gays running everywhere, oh yeah just to have one computer from a gay couple was black. I was surprised at C ecclestone so think about this when I read the script.
