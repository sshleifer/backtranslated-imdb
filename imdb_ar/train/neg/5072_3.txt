One self-admitted take-off. At some point, the assistant doctor refers to himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> By working with the increasingly reasonable notion that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time to explore the hypothesis. Most of the time of the screen is divided between the friendly local strife in a coma and the hunt for the donor of the brain donor. She tries to be a science fiction / drama / thriller but fails to achieve any of the three. <br /> <br /> Because of Frankenstein's repetition, this person lacks everything that makes the original good. No one calls the doctor crazy or even threatens to expel him from the hospital. The transition scene consists of a coma victim who opens one eye and does not show the amazing computer that is happening. When the experiment succeeds, there will be no praise, and when things start to appear, there will be little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about who can be a murderer is broken by showing him progressively in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding a murderer is as easy as opening a single file and interviewing one person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco is like overpriced and too little setting. The opening series at home highlights the point at SF, where the cable car plays an important role, live performances at the top of a Victorian hillside, Pier 39, and the final confrontation at the Golden Gate Park. More specifically along the ten-foot side of the cliff in the garden - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. As soon as the clear match rules are rounded, no further attempt will be made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> Acting is the only grace saved here. CARE internationally shows a good range and attracts a lot of real emotional scenes. Susanna Love depicts the healing of a coma well. Tony Curtis gets only a few lines and doubles the number of evil men who stare at most of the "Francis" movie, which his assistant explained. The little blond boy also plays the sermon. <br /> <br /> I also gave him an additional star to the scene where he leads the pair south of the bridge, turning into a bend in an irrelevant car park and then returning immediately to the bridge heading north. It takes a great deal of things - courage, ignorance and deadlines - to try to overtake them through the scenes while chasing a car.
