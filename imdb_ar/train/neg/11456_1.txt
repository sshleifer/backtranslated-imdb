This is one of those films that makes you think: Did Hogan "the real American" do the same thing? Frankly I do not think it was right. I'm Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I did not make another team (the French, for example), just because I love Juliette Pinochet. Besides the protagonist does not fall in love with the desire of a British girl at the end of the film but with fellow fellow, why so blasphemy against Yale. As far as representation is concerned, well, all players behave very badly. Then, as you know, I hated the atmosphere of the Dead Poets Society. In fact this is another film I hate.
