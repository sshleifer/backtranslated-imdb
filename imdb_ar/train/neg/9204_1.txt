I have watched this movie several times, (and recently read the book on which the film is based) and every time I see it, I just want to slap them all. The fact is that they do not hint at the fact that Tom Hank's personality turns into his character in D & D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he's acting only personally.") Outside the gaming session. This is the fact that after three months of treatment, let's just destroy all that and nourish his illusions! It's the kind of people who call the RPG a bad name. <br /> <br /> The "Love Band" is full of music, the "cat on the piano" music and "we stop if we get too annoying" enough to put your teeth on the edge!
