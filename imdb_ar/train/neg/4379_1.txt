<br /> <br /> Well, I rented this movie well while I was a popup mattress on painkillers, and let me say, it did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a man who buys a car as he goes through a midlife crisis, loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I do not want to spoil (there's nothing I spoil), I'll let your imagination discover the instincts of "Zany" (and use that word lightly). <br /> <br /> To fight to stay awake during this snoring that sleeps a minute from the movie, I would say that if you ventured into the movie shop and think about adventure, please do not, it's a waste of the film. Printed on. <br /> <br /> Then again I might be wrong ...
