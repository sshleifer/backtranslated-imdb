A novel by Remark. The staff looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to survive in Paris between the two wars. Officer Gestapo Sri. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that there is no synergy here. Never cut pieces and pieces. <br /> <br /> The stories about leftist refugees in France should not be boring. Read Arthur Koestler's "Earth Scum" memoirs (if you can find them). Or "dialogue with death" (chilling) chilling. <br /> <br /> To me, the only interest in this film is in some emergency details. <br /> <br /> Time to drink calvados, Norman and apple brandy. I welcome any claim that I get a sip of the skull myself. Definitely make this movie look like it passes faster. But, according to the film, it is only sold in low-priced cheap salons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I'm saying. The references to many mascara wines here; this may seem to be a concern for scenarios. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the movies filmed in France because they can be amusing waiting for the full-size alcohol declaration that is inevitable to pop up in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for PEREH, a very unusual option. The rate of this movie reaches 10 if we only judge it in improving its murals. <br /> <br /> The uncritical result of the film is written by Louis Gruenberg. Gronenberg is known - if you can call him - the opera "Emperor Jones", based on the play O'Neill. It was shown at approximately the same time as the film version of Paul Robson. The opera survived today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tipt. The roof must be back soon though. They run out of operas that can be marketed to revive them. <br /> <br /> It seems that Oprah is an appropriate subject to mention here because the character of Charles Bauer operates under the pseudonym "Czech". Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both of whom are prominent role in the German Opera. Is this just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> It seems that dropping the name is part of this film. Note that they are called "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss is one of the main characters in Remarque's previous novel "All Quiet on the Western Front." <br /> <br /> Well, all the jokes exist; I think there was no time to develop any drama.
