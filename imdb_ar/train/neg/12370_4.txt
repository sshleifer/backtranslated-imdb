Maybe they should have called this movie map because the majority of the whole stupid movie revolves around a cemetery map. Not to mention the number of boring shots of the map itself. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the small sweat beads that constantly accumulate on the front of our main character. This was, of course, a way for filmmakers to show us how to wake up incredibly tense things in the Immortal Hills cemetery. Now, can not they have just shown us a scene of death scenes? We hear a lot about how everyone on the map falls like flies but we do not see anything. Somehow I bury The Living to keep my attention so I was somewhat generous with my rating but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat, I recommend renting a better I movie, like I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink the Blood.
