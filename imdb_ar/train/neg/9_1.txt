This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. It explodes with almost any kind of excitement and can cause chaos for all of them. <br /> <br /> There is no good line or character in the whole mess. If there is a plot, it was a late idea and as far as acting, there is nothing good to say so do not say anything. Frankly I can not understand how this kind of nonsense is actually produced and released. Does someone think somewhere and not at some point, "Oh my God, this is really a burden of nonsense" and call it daily. In such a picture that contains people who download it illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you download it, do not waste your time or money do not waste your time, it's painful.
