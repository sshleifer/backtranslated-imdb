The Revenge of the Sith begins with an impressive long sequence of moves without being terribly dramatic, and then becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same terrible dialogue and ruthless machinations plagued by the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves actions is slowness - I mean slow down - what we know is the birth of Darth Vader. When it finally comes, it's fine. Not great. Not so good. But pretty all right. This film is highly overrated because it does not absorb the high sky like the previous consequences. Instead, it's just boring, routine, and routine. But you have to say, Wow, these CGI environments are sometimes impressive. Bo battles lizards? They are all a hazy mess. I think that the dark side took Lucas when this turbulence started and nobody noticed. This will earn a lot of money, but thank God it is over, this privilege which was once worshiped has been defeated enough. I watched a 12: 1 show, and then, I heard a group of very young children say, I've had it wonderful! But everyone over eight years grumbled the same thing: I grew up in the middle. It was kind of boring. I've just thought about seeing Darth Vader's birth. So said all of us.
