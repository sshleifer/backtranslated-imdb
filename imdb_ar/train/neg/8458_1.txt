I bought this movie last weekend at the local film show. I was buying 2 get 2 for free and I needed one last so I chose this one. A terrible mistake. The box reads like it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts as if this movie was wonderful. For 5 minutes, that is. The film revolves around a young woman, Laila, who is killed trying to save the lover, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobbs, is a farmer feared by the townspeople. It is assumed that Jack killed Leila because she was afraid of this bull, and continues this search to find him. Those were the first 5 minutes good. The following will then become the worst 100 times. Both script writers, in my opinion, had to make a tart trip or something like that because nothing else had any meaning at all. Jack runs away and finds a DJ named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Mary is supposed to be the figure of the Virgin Mary. You know, Mother of Jesus. But, who knows, I could not make heads or tails. As we walk ... we get to see the bad guys, the magical visions, the ghost encounters, and the memories of the past ... and all these things are done in a way that makes your mind try to discover what is going on. Needless to say, I returned the film and replaced it with something else. It is terrible to say, O terrible. There is no fighting at all in this film. Unless you calculate the first minute of the film. I hope I have helped some other people not to waste their time in this movie.
