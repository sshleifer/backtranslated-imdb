After being bitten by a bat in a cave, the doctor named John Peck undergoes a rapid transformation into a creature of the bat. The wife assured him that there was nothing wrong with him, all due to rabies or rabies. The local policeman believes John is responsible for many of the heinous murders. "Bats People" by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a terrible film. The script is dull and deadly and there is no gore or nudity. Too boring for the mind to scratch your head in disbelief after your suffering. Even the design of a bat creature by a young man from Win Stanston is pathetic and utterly unforgivable. Avoid this stinking like plague. Of 10.
