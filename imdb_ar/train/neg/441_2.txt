We do not have this on TV in England but I've been online on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is the creator of "Earth Worm Jim" Douglas Tenable, I did not get this cartoon but I have to admit it better than this. The cartoonist has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a trivial feature and a return forever! The story revolves around three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money from their dead old lady. They are controversial and continue to disagree about what they want to spend their money on. "boring"! The animation is awesome. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just alien creatures beast-looking beast with big mouths, pointed teeth and huge eyes! Human characters and other ugly real animals are also painted! The theme song is awesome and annoying! Also lame stories are probably copied from old programs. I was surprised how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes for other IMDb viewers. TV really is not what I used to be! But most of them are now stupid and bored. Some of you on the site may not agree with me well. I'm sorry but this is a complete waste of money and totally wasteful and sloppy for your time and I feel happy because Britain does not tolerate this nonsense (oh, if you have your digital), but I do not, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and luckily I get it because I made other worst offers!).
