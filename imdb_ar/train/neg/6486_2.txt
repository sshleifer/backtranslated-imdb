If there's one thing you can count on from Disney to do, it's their exotic ability to take a story and tell it over and over again. Even the announcement of Lady and the Tramp II was a terrible experience. Disney will destroy one of its coolest classic at all. This scene was so spicy minced pasta. I've done this before! This is what I am saying to this directly sorry to the video (the whole concept must be banned). Everything is just a rework of the original film and even many really bad Bluth movies. The ducks and ducks (I've forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Bomba. Morgana is another Ursula. They are practically repeating all their old lines. The songs are pathetic, really too bad. I have not heard very bad songs from them yet. The dialogue is terrible. It's pathetic and simple. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation pretty decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe this is minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is so cute and annoying that she may just vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and love Little Mermaid Fit. Do not waste your money on this. True, it is not as ghastly as the return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but this is little solace.
