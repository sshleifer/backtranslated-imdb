I am out of the Puertorican, and had mixed fillings about this "documentary". At first I felt insulted because Ms. Perez had compared Senor Campos and Che Guevara. Also just a fact point, Mr. John Legosimo is not out of Puerto Rican. The parents came from Colombia. Everyone who did this research was not very precise. I feel that the future of our sex depends on education. This message should have been loud throughout this film. Education is our way to freedom and power, and I believe that any future endeavors of this production team must make this focus.
