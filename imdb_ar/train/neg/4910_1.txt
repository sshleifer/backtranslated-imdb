The word "1st" in the title has a more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than its victims. At least, they do not have to turn around and watch this endless film as it comes to an end. <br /> <br /> The first must refer to: The first draft of the scenario; it takes the 1st used in each performance in the final film. 1st edit post-production. etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The film was not filmed so badly, it's just that everything about the film comes worse than the third rate, from the brilliant script, to the wood shows. In spite of suffering through this coarse film together, no matter what two hours, you want to quench your misery. In 160 minutes, it was clear that it was supposed to be edited to less than two hours. <br /> <br /> Access to details about lame texts and representations serves few purposes. Even in the equally horrific, Lake Placid, at least performances by Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda manufactured from a very weak script, are accurate enough to make you laugh at the film. In the 1st to Die, it ends up grieving for lost time just waiting for what happens after the opening scene to prepare for the female suicide. <br /> <br /> The modification is very bad. The edit has never been offered to one of the main characters, which I think (never been told) is DA appearing only in one scene in the middle of the conversation. It is clear that the scene in which I met the viewer fell on the editor's floor. No one realized that the character that appeared from anywhere was an unusual stunt for movies. <br /> <br /> In one word, do not waste your time with this person. My wife and I wish we did not do it. But at least we created our own transformations by commenting in different places in the film, just like the mysterious science scene. "At the same time, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
