After watching this, I lost little respect to Christopher Lee (this has passed over time). This film was absolute trash. First, try to rework the end of the first "howl", using a very bad makeup. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse for a pornographic film of a Werewolf! The plot sucks and the whole movie is awesome! The brother of the bereaved victim of the first film (from his appearance, was supposed to be De Wallace Stone) collaborates with me and another woman to destroy a group of wolves, led by Sibyl Daning, who seems to be a disgrace all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth leasing (unless you want to waste time and money watching nudity.). Try picking them up on the cable instead. It would be too much, and it might be logical.
