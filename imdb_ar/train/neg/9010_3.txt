When you want to eat each dragon member of the cast, you know that you are on a bad trip. <br /> <br /> I went very low expectations, having read some other comments, and did not disappoint. Unlike some cheap and failed films, this film does not remain funny (and unintended) all the time. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all it's very inconsistent. Looking beyond the "small" errors, such as raising a dragon in 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based has faded. Look, the film wants us to believe that the dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining it, they show some peasants flocking to someone with the appearance of a guilty dragon and pops out. Later, the man ridicules the "crazy world" mandatory of how long the dragon survives on the dinosaurs. Obviously humans were present when dinosaurs were present, or we had a small plot gap here. The other main thing is that the laboratory was detonated with a "half power" force as it was used for Hiroshima. Then two young men later walk to check everything, it is almost safe! There is another dragon that grew up who knows what. All in all is very predictable. Once the man mentioned the cloning, I thought they had cloned a flag. This means that the Smarty-pants security man is not as intuitive and intelligent as the movie thinks, if you ignore that you knew this movie would be familiar. <br /> <br /> Putting it aside, the second worst thing is "special effects." Others have mentioned fake rocks falling through the beginning, a CG helicopter, and a dragon. It seemed a little better than the point, but it destroyed everything that was happening to him when he walked in the hall the same way time after time. Thanks to the fact that the flying dragons at first appeared to be fine from afar (although those in the cave may have been the worst in the entire film). The viewer where a million different shots are displayed for the same person facing different ways. Also, the "Serving" screens contain vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Looking at the actors, they were not the best, but at least I think they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they are doing than many representatives involved in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for it. One thing I noticed though was that the woman who played Meredith often had her face covered with makeup and was much lighter than the rest of her colors. They looked like they were having a bad run with some white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and cheesy. Do not really notice music, but it's really not too bad for the most part. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you do not see them unless you want to watch them because you hear them are bad (like you did), although the only ridiculous things are CG's bad effects. Otherwise, do not waste your time and money.
