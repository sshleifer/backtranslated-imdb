Hey man, you bite this movie! If you are ever afraid of seeing a rework of this italic type, it was done at the cheapest possible price and warned at the same time (Buddy for PC, it means no nudity or classic element of wet films). All cliches are renewed without reference to self-awareness and representation. Oh, acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better that the direct Dutch translation of the title would have made me nervous.
