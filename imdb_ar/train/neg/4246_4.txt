Ann Bancroft plays the role of Estelle, a dead Jewish mother who asks her son-in-law, Ron Silver, to locate Greta Garbo, the one-time movie star, and present the two before she visits Estelle. "Bancroft Talks" as an actress may be attacking these unpopular comedy / dramatic / emotional material during her term. Cold or cold Sydney director Lometh can not get a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's over-exaggeration is not underestimated by the director - he keeps it in the foreground: bland, eye-eyed and accurate. Estelle becomes an obstacle in this scenario (not that the thin plot is heavily designed). Silver and starring actors Carrie Fisher and Katharine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone tramples her on her Haming. * 1/2 of ****
