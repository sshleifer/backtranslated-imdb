I was thinking that the main character, an astronaut with a bad jogging condition (in his / her condition, skin, hair, muscles, etc.) can always get more movie work after turning it into a pool. All he has to do is get a job like Blob. The premise of this flick is very lame. An astronaut is exposed to sunspot radiation (I think), and so he starts acting like an ice cream cone on a hot day. This is not just a puzzle, but it seems that humans must be killed and consumed by their bodies so that they can maintain a kind of cell integrity. Hey? Have you ever noticed that whenever there is any kind of radiation accident or experiment, the person immediately turns into a killing machine? why is that? <br /> <br /> The astronaut comes out of the night from the "secret facility" (which has no safety at all), dislodging parts of it as it is. He seems to have enough memory to make it go to the launch pad, perhaps because he wanted to go back to space. <br /> <br /> So the part of the highly-populated movie, with a doctor walking around with Geiger counter, begins to try to find the soliloquy through his buzz. He kills a stupid fisherman like Bill Gates, scares a little girl from the monster Frankenstein movie, and ends up an idiot old couple (punished in a karmic way to steal some lemons). Then there is a short scene where the former general hits, and a very long scene where a young man is killed and chasing his girlfriend. You think that after you cut his arm and fled, the scene will turn. But no ... We dealt with about ten minutes of women gathered in a corner panting and yelling at terror, even though the beast had gone. All I thought it was .. girlfriend director, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the film is lame from the rest of the film. The melting ends of the guy turns into a pile of goo, then ... nothing. This is. This is the end of the film. Well, at least this means that there was no room for a sequel.
