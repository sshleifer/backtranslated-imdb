I rejoice at the movies that fill the gaps in international cinema. So after watching the video of "Water Lilies", I was expecting to like this movie because I thought I found something unique: a film that candidly depicts teenage lesbianism - a kind of female version of "Beautiful Thing". <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15-year-old French girls. Mary is slim, reserved and beautiful in a vulgar manner; Florian is outgoing, sporty and beautiful. He is loyal, obese and immature. The exciting relationship between Mary and Florian is always boiling in this film, if not on the surface, then directly below it. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, does not relate to the infusion of homosexual love over adolescents; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, and adolescents who work in common purposes - and in at least two cases - miserable mechanical sex. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers distort their own creations when they become very manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the additional features on the "Lord of the Flies" DVD, French humor begins with sex, "director Peter Brooke says, meaning that French consider children to be angels while teenagers and adults are widely ridiculed . Part of the fall of this film is director Celine Siamma who took a huge dose of this irony. <br /> <br /> "Where is the joy?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and exciting to stir up in a new way that emphasizes life. These positive aspects are missing from this film; there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this film wants to be an emotional celebration of first love. But Sciamma is very impressed by her irony and skill and destroys the film. First, what is the point of showing only a plump naked girl? I know that there is a strong tradition of naughty teen nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by films such as "slingshot; villains; the devil, perhaps; the little thief; the immersion of the heart; friends" and "Europe, Europe." "There is no nudity or nudity that is equally evenly distributed." <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the club where Florian is dancing. The following follows not only Florian manipulating Mary sarcastically, he is the film director Sciamma playing cynically with her audience. <br /> <br /> Maybe The biggest betrayal of originality and honesty occurs when Florian warns Mary that she is about to ask something "unnatural." Mary asks conceptually "Who cares about being normal?" Sciamma then plays falsely with her audience and the painful momentum of the film, because Floriane's request is a fake and derived question And the alternative - not the original question and the heart of the film, and the character of Mary and the viewers who invested their time deserve it. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that clash falsely with the nerves of the viewer: 1) Since when do the French - of all people - take showers wearing suits Shower, with a turtle to take off? 2) What is a teenager - of any nationality - that will join the apple kernel thrown into the garbage in order to get the taste of the lover's mouth? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising, and if they find the best vehicles for their talent, the actors may become excellent. Louise Blacher (Ann) is the best actress in terms of technique and can have a successful career supporting roles. Adele Hannel (Florian) could become a leading lady or a bomb or both. Pauline Aquart (Marie) has an unmistakable intensity and magnetism. In the future, she could play everything from an emotionally written library to a mysterious sensory seduction to a hesitant politician riding up a meteorite in praise. <br /> <br /> Overall, Water Lilies was very disappointing. Does a true filmmaker make a real film about two young women falling in love! No - not necessarily for this middle-aged man - but young lesbian girls can enjoy something of quality that they can see and recognize. And yes, to fill the theme gap in global cinema.
