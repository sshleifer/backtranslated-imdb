This may have been Gone With The Wind's homosexuality because of its epic length, but instead he pretended to be a huge series of empty rings in which nothing happens at all. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other evolution in the story (in fact there is no story too) of searching for each other and kissing. It is shameful to lose an interesting aesthetic idea, such as not having almost any dialogue in the film, to make every effort to study the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and to achieve real emotional resonance. Moreover, he pretends to be a "technical" film using the worst of the naive cliches of film fighting. But anyway, if someone can sympathize with his heavy vanity, I think this is good.
