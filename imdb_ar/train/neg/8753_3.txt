This kind of film reminds me of Mary-Kate and Ashley. The only rich sisters are the thing that I think although Alison's was more actress, in this film Amanda Michalka was at times fine but Allison was acting bravely. I think that after high school music they needed to come up with something better and this certainly was not. The story line was not great, and I thought they had to get two more people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a fan of Allison Mikalka, and this film never made me love him more than ever. I think they should definitely sing and watch this movie only if you do not have something better to do (which is sad I did not do)
