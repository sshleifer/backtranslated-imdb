I never heard of Adam Sandler's film until I saw him on the wall in Blockbuster. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at the time, I hired it. Honestly I can only watch about 30 minutes. So. It was terrible. Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public. I sincerely hope that this film ends soon, and I hope it continues as it is!
