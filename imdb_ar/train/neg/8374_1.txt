What is the point of reviewing a movie like this? It is very painful and embarrassing, not even in a way that allows you to ridicule it. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Little Man" bother me. They represent the film at its best. This film was produced for a group of boys aged 18-24 who were hoping that the studio would come out and see it on the opening night before the floor leaked to how bad it was, so the film quickly compensated for the investment. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of other filmmakers with great ideas may have been unable to produce their films because the resources were moving towards making this state of vomiting. <br /> <br /> Grade: F
