I own almost every Seagal movie (yes even similar low-budget movies), and I must say, this may be the worst, not only of his films, but among all the films that have ever been produced. The most important feature of this film, the only reason I gave him two stars instead of 1 is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some exciting sequences, especially in the store, and also when he takes another army full place with a knife. The next time, give me 90 minutes of killing Seagal, not even bothering to tell the story, because the story of the story not only stopped but also the representation, the fact that the F-18 and F-14 somehow changed to the F-16s, Faster than F-16. Also stealth never had to refuel ?? Since when was Afghanistan considered hostile territory from the perspective of the Air Force. Last time I checked, Afghanistan does not have the Air Force, we (USA) control the sky. Also, this supreme secret task is played through the speakers for all the crew in the room, but the admiral is still whispering to the other man that he is secret. Also, how did Seagal move from the bottom of the truck, to the top? Please tell us why they imprisoned him, because when are Air Force pilots special forces (unless they are Owen Wilson) and why are they drunk in Arab countries, considering Muslims do not drink alcohol? Moreover, since when did the Arabs listen to female orders such as the second official? Seagal was the most prominent in the film, killing people in the store, while the other 50 were killed with a knife, in addition to the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
