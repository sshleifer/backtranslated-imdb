Watching "Happening Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. The sight of such a prolific writer, actor, comedian, director, and trick of the man who is exposed to this humiliating scene is like seeing Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps like seeing the most beautiful camembert mixed with solid whey and processed at Cheez-Whizz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is uncommon as Professor Post, whose excessive vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post could have said something like, "Please tell me about the status of small mammals in the Leporidae family of Lagomorpha, gentle sir, which I think was basically addressed with the word 'George.'") When Keaton created his own characters, They were ignorant of the situation, but they were not stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. This is not the case with Post, who has never stopped faltering and who has no more control over his fate than the old rat that the Titanic enjoyed. Although the original Keaton characters were naive and charming, Post sees him as a deep sexual hindrance that, if aroused physically, he has put a snowy bag on the swelling and sought medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a few simple moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vibrant Thema Todd or suggest it for the proper Greek dance clothes, but it is not worth a full movie to see. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, drunk and watching "talk easily" with friends, play "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But otherwise, stick to silence. So be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembers.
