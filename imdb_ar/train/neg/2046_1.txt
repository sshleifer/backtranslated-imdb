I can not believe that this film made it reach the video, and the video rental shops are ready to put it on their shelves. I asked the literary to recover. Take the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it is still the worst movie ever found in a video store. It is not good enough to be called a B rated film. Do not waste your money or time in this movie. Just listed on the terrible music sound made me ill. Anyone who participates in this film should be withdrawn from the union, giving the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this film, I do not really think that anyone involved is a member of the union.
