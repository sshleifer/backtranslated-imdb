Warning! Small plot details !! <br /> <br /> I do not find anything positive to say about this film. It is so poorly written that each character is caricatured, yet they seem to take themselves very seriously. They are badly poured, especially Ralph Machio (all he has a child face, nothing to him 5 feet) as a force in the direction of the street. All chart elements are drawn in black and white, with each position mounting almost to its maximum height. <br /> <br /> The most horrific of all (PLOT ELEMENT ABOUT TO REALEALED), probably contains the best nude crazy and frantic scene in the history of the film is almost dangerous. One can imagine that filmmakers say: "We need JoBeth to give up the top ... Hmmm ... I have ... Early in the film, let's keep Nick from some silly conversation about scolding yourself in the corridors ... then JoBeth can use this line at a later time and really wear it in the lobby ... Yes, this is the card! "<br /> <br /> I will give the producers the merit of addressing a topic of importance in 1984, one that proved its weight in the late 1990s With events such as Columbine. However, implementation is appalling. It could have been a dark comedy in the context of "Heaters," or a suspicious political statement like "Network" or a serious test like "Brubaker." Instead, try to have all these things - and end up not being any of these things. "Teachers" get WoW
