Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the footage is amazing, the material is exciting. However, they were very disappointed and left in fact very angry by what Disney did. <br /> <br /> Planet of the BBC was all the above and more. It was accurate. He had a general sense of balance and showed a whole circle of life and death. There was tragedy, victory, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's release of the land is nothing. They tried to make it a film that we are talking about. They made it dramatic. They put more of the highest musical score there to scare us. They made evil predators. They made evil WALRUSES. They showed every negative encounter. I tried to be suspicious and succeeded, but at the expense of the balance lesson. The film was an hour and a half of negative photography and only about 10 minutes of positive. <br /> <br /> I am all for the sake of global warning, but this was at the top of political and environmental scrap. <br /> <br /> This is another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the image quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the full picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the BBC Planet Earth series. They are better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) a better image quality.
