The first notable problem about this film, which has an embarrassing title, is its casting. Anne Nelson plays grandma here. Three years later, she was a star in "Plane!" As a woman hanging on to herself while listening to Robert Hayes's pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Boston is 15 years old and has problems. He has a headache. His mother was a nervous breakdown. His grandfather suffered a massive heart attack. A psychiatrist decides to smoke to see what the devil is about with this family. First sleeps Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a story in the flashback that fills the entire first half of the film. <br /> <br /> She and his grandfather bought a RV, cheap, and drive in all the tourist traps in the California desert. The RV soon has its own mind, starting from the road and so on. Then, the big rocks begin to extrude themselves out. The elderly couple are fearful enough, but they remain in the vehicle to move the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, the grandfather suffered a heart attack after being stranded on the surface of the RV when he goes for an unplanned ride. <br /> <br /> The mother of Boston begins talking to some of the Native American mummies that were lying around her at home. She imagines herself as a composer, making copious notes of rotting corpses. The psychiatrist reads detailed notes and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks. We see a quasi-quasi-external mother, but her mental breakdown occurs outside the screen, just like a heart attack for Gramps. <br /> <br /> Finally, resistance of the patient, died small. Matt goes under hypnosis gun and tells his tale. He thinks my mother is complaining (this was made in 1977). Apparently, my mother makes stellar bodies of Native American mummies flying in the air. One hits a dead man like a bee hitting the windshield, and Matt begins to act madly. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and dies in the desert. Matt is now wheelchair inexplicably, facing the trio of invisible forces (and unexplained). <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of building the scene. One pro here involves an RV stranded in an apartment salt in the desert. In the distance, the couple noticed some rocks rolling towards the RV. This small creepy scene is often exaggerated. When the rocks start to turn toward the car, the special effects become apparent. <br /> <br /> The scenes where the RV runs off the highway, then back again, take forever. The scenes where the grandfather is confined to the surface of the RV because they are interested in a dirt road take forever. Mom talks with the mummy take forever. Matt of the body experiences take forever. Take this movie forever. <br /> <br /> It has been tempting to press the fast forward button at least twelve times. When the scenes continued, it was clear that the Flocker was a charge. Cut fat here, this would be recorded in one hour. The last "interpretation" indicates that the lives of the mummies were trying to kill those close to Matt who had no water at all. Were they living in a shelf? The filmmaker has never come out of the fact that spirits are not good in their deadly ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> While I was thinking of Nelson in "The Plane!" , I also thought of other films. Nothing prevents me from sleeping during sleep. Boston is as terrible as a child. A 15-year-old boy plays like a cute 10-year-old boy and has a neat, smart line for all those adults who fall on themselves and love him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flickr wrote and guide chaos. The title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the public feel sick. This is not scary, and like ghosts, you can still walk ... away from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is unclassified and contains some physical violence and light words.
