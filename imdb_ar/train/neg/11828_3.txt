A few months ago, I participated in a discussion with another IMDb poster (Ya Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if "Flushed Away" was given an opportunity, I wanted it. Based on this argument in part, she agreed to watch the film. <br /> <br /> "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least by Aardman), but I lack the strength to pull them all together. Her best assets are Captain Rat / Rita Boat (played by Kate Winslet), who was supposed to be the main character IMO in the film instead of Rudy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is wonderful, strong and interesting, while Rudy spends much of his time tapping. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me most about "FA" is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to start with. When Roddy collides with the babies, the film makes sure he is beaten five times immediately. "My name is Shuki," says one of Rita's brothers, who rouses Rudy at least three times. My tolerance with cheap masks that involve pain is at its lowest levels ever. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time going to Katsenberg's labyrinthine tendencies toward Pixar (one coincidental film, five ripping). , But I will say I am disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and do) much better. Try harder next time, guys.
