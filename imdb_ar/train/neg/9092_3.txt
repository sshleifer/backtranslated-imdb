Friz Freleg 'Speedy Gonzalez' was the second caricature of the title after Cat-tails for Two. In that caricature, Speedy was a small ugly creature with large gold teeth, but in its second appearance, the already famous design was adopted. Although it seems more and more remarkably toxic, Speedy did not evolve into a big figure. The big hat, the tremendous speed and the bad Mexican accent do not make a traditional character and that was all. However, the exciting little mouse has proved hugely popular and has continued to be represented in many short films including some really abysmal films from the last days of the studio. While the early Speedy shorts are better than those of the subsequent atrocities that have been coupled with a lot (strange) with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired and rely on predictable gags that usually rely on a similar chase mode. In this self-titled episode, some other rats were recruited at Speedy to steal cheese from the local factory encountered by Sylvester the cat. Although it brings extra weight to the star to the cartoons, Sylvester's role here can easily be filled by any other public cartoonist. His character is dropped because he is forced to predict. The role of the contestant from the appendices. This has always been a problem with Tweety's drawings as well, but Speedy makes a quieter opponent thanks to his disgusting power and the impossibility of apprehending him starkly. Poor Sylvester will have to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Although following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughter, "Speedy Gonzalez" won an Oscar for an entirely undesirable star.
