This is a little better than the first. Still depends on a lot of humor that continues to say that old Bond movies were not realistic. To wear thin after a lot of parody. The girls were more interesting in this girl. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous amount of humor. Hope one day a real comedy will come back.
