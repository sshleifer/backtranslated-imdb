This film is an insult to all seafarers. He was a fool. It seems to have been written by monkeys. The representation was ridiculous. If this is the opinion of most people in the Navy, I'm crying for our defense. This film was awful. I have put it below the "trip to the seabed" as far as the submarine movies go. Jane Hackman needs to rent money to do this. Denzel Washington must be high. Little in the plot makes no sense. And finally. To reward a rebel for his crime? Only Hollywood will think about this garbage. If you have not received it yet, I did not like it. If this is not the case for all professional comments, it will not bother posting.
