My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. I started well but soon became boring and stupid frankly after a while. It was so bad that we turned it off. The film was behaving badly and honestly, we could not really understand or want to understand exactly why or how the hell they could face this woman! I lost sympathy with her after she was slut and acting singing and cleaning. You may have committed. Of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we have to throw it into a "gay" character symbolically! This film was boring. I was expecting more than Diane Keaton!
