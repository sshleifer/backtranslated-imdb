Once again, a classic film has been re-produced in vain with disastrous consequences. The wrong title is all about this movie. This period has not been convincingly presented, and the young clients seem too much to be afraid of being criminals. Arthur's son had a style, humor, point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version does not exist, this film will remain unnecessary. The 1967 version of the facts, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and imaginative in 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. It seems that the new 1992 edition was produced from the original film instead of the truth as it is known, and the actors in this release are Kalua, unattractive, and not less interesting. After all, skip this and hopefully have a better 2010 version. Maybe it could be worse?
