As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can carry any animation that can be imposed on me, but there is absolutely no reason for it. <br /> <br /> "Super Action" has been rated in the Blockbuster Video section and the exhaustive "Restricted Poster" has been presented. I suppose these are the only ways that the filmmaker (Robert Hutton) can use at least 4.50 people Someone who is not interested. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on you to exploit these poor Mexican actors who are likely to have promised to make them great in American cinema. You're a shame! <br /> <br /> There is not a single moment in this movie carrying the least amount of action. Have you used mucus on these people? Oh, look, they care about a field! Like all 6 of them. Is not this Asian man in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take half of the film to show anything .. More importantly, why did we see the other half? <br /> <br /> Note: You owe me 4.50.
