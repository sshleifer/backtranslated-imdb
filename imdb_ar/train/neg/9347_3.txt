This film limps from the moment of self-indulgence to the moment of self-indulgence, and prepares evolution to something worth clinging to. but not. He is flat, aware of himself, and can not imagine anything boring. <br /> <br /> A series of specific images and backgrounds do not make a film, but make a calendar. This kind of pathetic pseudo-social drama ("It really happened") not only fails to entertain, it fails to persuade, so it does not work even as social history. Cliches that combine with bad acting make it extremely difficult to finish this movie, and the entertainment factor wears fairly quickly. Characters with one dimension, never develop to the extent that a person feels towards them. Ego Outlet is the biggest character in this film.
