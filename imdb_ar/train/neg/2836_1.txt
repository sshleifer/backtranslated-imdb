I saw this schlock festival clearly on the video storage rack. Before I get my first VCR, I figured I would sympathize with these small gems and making bad movies at best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inadvertently hilarious. It contains an engraving with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn in it for an inexplicable reason. Just as Christopher Walcken seemed to want to represent every bad film in his last years. This movie is Mr. Binn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It features lines like "Shut up and let me kill!" <br /> <br /> And "You say so much shit!" <br /> <br /> The priceless return: "Unfortunately she is angry, angry and arduous!" <br /> <br /> You will feel a fighting scene as Bo SOMMERSAULT does at a pool table! Kung Fu kick is nice when you come from a roll! Cut the bold motion and stir T and A !!! <br /> <br /> What can the schlock fans want to get more? Oh, when Mr. Quinn's character is suicidal, she comes back to chase Bo as a ghost asking him why he killed himself, and then he treats his debilitating illness? "The real men do not eat quiche," he says. <br /> <br /> Ah, aa, yes. If Bo is a clever cookie, they will call the evil-eater at the time there!
