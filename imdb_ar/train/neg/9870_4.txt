I encountered many problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) Screenplay - specifically, Kim Basinger's voice: films are not books; they must * show * action rather than have more voice * tell us * what happens . From time to time I find an audio movie that works, but here it seemed more than a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it seemed to me that she was practically reading extracts from the novel with her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jesse and Brother Thomas and I also felt that Alex was a very bad Carter representation. This is a big failure for me in identifying the characters Jesse and Thomas - with no connection between them, it seemed to me as if I just wanted to nail, and for him it was an issue deprived of sex. If it had been done correctly, the relationship between them would have given a greater context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With this book, I understood Jesse's middle-aged crisis. In the film, it seemed like ordinary boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the film was too bad for me to turn off the TV. . . Though thought did not happen to me.
