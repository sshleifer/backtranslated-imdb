I'm a man who loves guy movies ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with great special effects. All this happened, however, this film was the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story was normal, but the story was terrible. The scene shifts were the worst I've ever seen. Why walk to the beach to relax if your life is in danger? The serpent's dragon snake itself was badly written ... The snake dragon's attack capabilities varied widely during the film, several times the main characters were supposed to have died. <br /> <br /> The director tried to publish a love story in which it is clear that this film was not seen in the middle of the film during the difficult times, after it was produced, and I love films, but I had to force myself to finish watching it, thank God I did not buy this, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not hire it, just watch Discovery Channel ... more exciting.
