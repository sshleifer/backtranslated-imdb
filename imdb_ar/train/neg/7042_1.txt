This must be one of the worst films ever produced. Even for a biker movie, it's in the bottom. The minimum plot includes a group of motorcyclists who take over a small town (how original!) And the town's attempts to fight it. Why do not they ask for foreign help? Who do you know? The fighting scenes are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise in it but both have little to do and seem both shy to be there (concept) This film belongs to the waste heap
