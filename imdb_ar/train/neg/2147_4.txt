The original is a comfortable watch, with some really memorable animation sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, though not the worst in the DTV sequences, is completely lacking in brilliance. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's magic world, characters are told through a series of short essays. The magical world, although marginally better, is still able to provoke chaos from the story. In between the short articles, we see mice at work, and I personally think that the exotic of Jaq and Gus are the advantages of replacing this film. <br /> <br /> The first short article is the best, about Cinderella's habit of being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were at their extremities here. The worst of short essays, when Jaq turns into a human being, is sometimes nice, but lacks imagination. The last short article, when Anastasia falls in love, was also nice. The problem was that I could not imagine a friendly Anastasia with Cinderella, which I considered more concise than the sisters. This also distorted a somewhat absurd sub-plot about Lucifer's fall in love with Bombum. <br /> <br /> The occasional music was very fun to listen to; however, the songs hated, were not really inspiring, and nothing like Tchaikovsky inspired the original melodies. <br /> <br /> The characters were the most powerful evolution here. While Cinderella lost her sincerity, she lost much of her charm from the original, although she wears some pretty clothes. The duke had really funny moments but they were not enough to save the film, as well as with Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, the mice had the advantages of replacing the film, because they contributed alone in the film gravity. I must also say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice representation was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> In general, a nice sequel, if not original, is marred by songs and a lack of story. 4/10 for mice, vocal representation, animation and some beautiful dresses.
