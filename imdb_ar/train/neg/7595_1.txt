The Ask Dust looked interesting from the trailer, and we all love the actors in particular. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be a drama, and was not funny enough to be a comedy. In practice he seemed to mock himself, and had no entertaining effect. After 70 minutes of waiting for this to improve, my wife and I went out and appreciated not wasting time in such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny or technical. It seems as if he wrote, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse, it was a shameful waste of unusually gifted actors, let alone our time and money.
