I do not know what Margaret Atwood was thinking of allowing this film to have the same name as her book. I was always a fan of The Robber Bride and I was very excited to know that there was a movie in the business. I realized that translating a book into a movie was not perfect, but it was the worst. The names of the women are correct and some of the background stories are true, but this is true. I feel I have lost a large part of my time trying to accomplish it through this film. This was supposed to be a small series to tell the story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> The representatives of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen although I was initially skeptical of Mary Louise Parker. I wish they had a better text to do because it has nothing to do with the book at all.
