I have seen other films of Guinea Pig, like Mermaid in a Manhole and He Never Die, and although she is very sick, at least she has a bit of humor (no matter how dark). Although Devil's Experience is only a depiction of a group of villains who offer a young girl to many methods of torture and violence, there is no conspiracy and no values ​​to recover at all. This is not scary remotely, except maybe mental, but it's definitely disgusting, and I certainly will not call it amusement. Now, I'm not a model of good taste in movies and I love trash and corruption, but this was a lot for me really. I'm all annoying, in fact, looking for annoying things whenever possible, but that was a lot. The young girl was kicked and beaten and subjected to constant noise through the headphones until she descended, then lifted with raw and interior meat and left hanging in a swing in the woods somewhere. If you think this sounds great, I'll look for it, but it certainly stopped me from showing any other things from the guinea pig. 1 out of 10, completely nausea.
