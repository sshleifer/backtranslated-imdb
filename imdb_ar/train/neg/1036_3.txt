Is hum. Inventor Horst Buchholz is a deadly biological weapon at risk of falling into the wrong hands. He knows his son (Luke Perry) was working on antidote all the time. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and start chasing cats and mouse and shooting. Also in the cast: Tom Conte, Hendrick Hayes and Roger Moore aging. Moore seems to be moving uneasily through this mess, certainly not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will accept. Dow is wrong in this role, but it's good to look at him.
