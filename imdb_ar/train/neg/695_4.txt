I heard a lot about this film how it was a great job and one of the early 80's films that died heavily on most evil films. Well, I hired it and I must say that although it kept my attention as far as the comment is concerned for most of the bright films such as "April Fool's Day", "Friday's 13th" and "Prom Night", it was true there with what The above mentioned only lacked the true enthusiasm and potential of the characters as well as the ongoing story. The characters who found it deplorable to be in this film were the eccentric curly-haired person who was sneaking around the house and of course leading to his real climate role during the end where he faced the killer. Another dirty guy with a dirty appearance with a jean jacket would have been able to play more roles in this film which may have made the film more interesting. Instead, the film played this man as just another loser making unknown calls while sleeping with his girlfriend Then he drops a part of it and cuts it to the end that was a waste, I was disappointed at the end. With regard to the real identity of the murderer, when his identity was released from it, he just laughed, but everything was clear and the real jerk of himself in addition to the annoying personality after his personality. Revealed true intentions. You should watch this movie at least once for all fans of fans but do not spend your hard earned money on it in some hard to find collectors stock.
