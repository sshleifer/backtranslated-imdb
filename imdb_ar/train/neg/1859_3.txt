This film was born to have fooled me. I honestly thought it would be an artificial horror film without any humor at all, a boy got a cold shoulder at the time. This film was, I am honest, damn pretty good. It was not scary at all, but the enthusiasm and humor of this funny film is really interesting. Some of the horrific killings and clich√© killings were so painful to see, I almost laughed at the extent of their harm, but to some extent I enjoyed them. All the killings are mysteriously related to snow sports and Christmas, making things more interesting. The corners of the POV camera were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a viscous killer dying in an accident with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. The resurrection is later in that same chemical with the ice divided into the mixture. These are the ingredients selected to make an ideal killer snowman. It is more than revenge, like the snowman, at the police officer who condemned him. <br /> <br /> This film had misbehavior, except for Christopher Alport, it was funny. I will say that I am very disappointed that this film was not a horror, but it is actually a dark comedy. They had a wonderful story with a good plot but it was not implemented properly. All in all I love the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is better and darker than the sequel.
