There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 HRGD002 code on the cover, there is no ASIN, VFC 19796 on disk, and there is no IFPI code on the inner edge. <br /> <br /> A direct transfer from VHS is possible. <br /> <br /> There is no great benefit of commenting on an adult movie. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in regular cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw him at Pensylvannia in 1975. As such, he deserves a place in the Encyclopedia of Films. The DVD does not contain special features and does not contain translations, and may be made using the VHS tape as a source
