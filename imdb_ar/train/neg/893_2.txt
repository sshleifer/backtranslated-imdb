When I bought this DVD (I DVD) though: "It seems like a nice light comedy about love and relationships designed according to Portuguese standards ?? Let's give it a chance ??" I was completely wrong! What a disappointing film! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is too boring and does not lead anywhere ?? It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Mixing sound is terrible, because sometimes sounds are separated. Made me recall some old Portuguese movies from the eighties ?? The representation should have been very good? Well, in short, Portuguese cinema will not improve with films like this. In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, misrepresentation, poor production? I had no great hope in this film, but it was much worse than I imagined! Just forget it!
