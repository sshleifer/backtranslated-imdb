It's really bad for the film. My friend rented it because, well, he is an idiot. But again, I must be a fool too because I watched everything cursed! The actors were on par with geeks in high school drama who think the places are going. The only place they will go is to return to the waiting tables in the lobby. All I was thinking of while I was watching this "gemstone" was how I actually made it. I mean, some of the "scriptwriter" actually believed that this hypothesis was new, innovative and profitable. Then some of the money-savvy people believed in the text that he decided to give up some money with a na√Øve misconception that he would make a return on it. Representatives were represented, sites were identified, and makeup artists were hired. New cartoonists from the Al Collins Graphic Design School were brought in and began to take shape. <br /> <br /> Obviously there are tons of things I hated about this move but the only thing that drove me crazy was the overuse of music. Every minute of this flick and scored. There was not one break in the music. Sometimes it was mixed up with dialogue, not because it made you miss a plot point or something vital. <br /> <br /> After it's over, we decided to see the Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 watt diesel horse and then going to the BMW 740il. You can not get two quality films.
