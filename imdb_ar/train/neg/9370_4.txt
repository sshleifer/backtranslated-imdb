Although this is not a "great movie", there is something memorable and unforgettable. Like another comment on the film, I saw this in childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have not forgotten the story or its exhausting title. See it if you have the opportunity. You will feel as if you are peeping from the city's small life as it evolves over decades. More than any other film, this film brings a human face to the historical drama "progress" in the early 20th century. It is attractive enough for young viewers and is not memorable enough for older viewers. Moreover, it is easy to love characters and see their passage through time.
