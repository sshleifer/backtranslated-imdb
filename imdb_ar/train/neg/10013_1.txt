A worn-out plot for a man who takes rap for a woman in a murder case + an equally abandoned plot from the outside of the inside that has been eventually closed. <br /> <br /> With such an outstanding situation, one might think that the movie will rise above its penetrating origins. But the scene of after the drone sight unchanged in intensity, no personal arches, inexplicable behavior. <br /> <br /> Homosexuality was absolutely unnecessary - or, on the other hand, not fully explored. It seems that only the bites of viewers are included. When will Hollywood learn that owning characters does not automatically lead to a more convincing picture? <br /> <br /> It's a scary movie, unfortunately. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good idea? I was expecting her best and Christine Scott Thomas. This one is definitely the one to miss.
