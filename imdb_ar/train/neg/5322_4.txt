There are two musical 1950s. First you have MGM's brilliant products with great names and great music. Then you have a small league with lesser-known reps and lesser-known music and second-rate directors. "The girl can not help her" belong to the latter category. Tom Ewel, Edmund O'Brien and Jane Mansfield were famous for their reputation ... well, do not mind. Each contract seems to have a share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is as thin as Razorblade and one can only doubt that it is trying to sell records of Fats Domino or Little Richard or other rock music works that have appeared in the film mostly. If this music appeals to you, it is worth watching. If not, do not bother.
