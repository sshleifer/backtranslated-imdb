Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, fifteen years old, and her birthday comes in one week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to connect her, but the few who have managed to attract her attention die in mysterious circumstances. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to see it was that Dana Kimmel on Friday was the thirteenth thirteenth in the film, and this is not a good reason to escape to watch a movie. When I started watching it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" was not very good, it was really boring and boring and did not go anywhere. After more than an hour, there were only three murders and the story did not actually develop in any way possible. <br /> <br /> The film was superbly filmed with great photography and good directing, but as with many other parts of the 1980s, the film suffers from extreme darkness at times. The acting is really good although Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she is a complete slut. <br /> <br /> The story line is not entirely nonsense but it is just a very boring way to keep you interested. The only things that kept me interested are Melissa who was amazing and Dana Kimel is really kind and wonderful in this film. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is the dull, dull flick that does not go anywhere I wanted to definitely recommend it to Slasher fans.
