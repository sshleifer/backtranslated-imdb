Yay! ... Think. Hard to say. It's hard to have a passion for a movie that has no passion. This film is sterile like a scalpel surgeon. For the preparation, it contains a few stone columns, some stone benches, stone crosses of the couple and some stone actors. They have no passion! The only thing that saves this film is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a beautifully written piece of literature. The dubbing really was not all that bad though. The voices cling to the dim, bleak, bleak atmosphere that absorbs life. I've seen this version of Hamlet on the wonderful 3D Mystery Science scene three times, and for each of the three times, I was about to turn off the TV, despite being a 3K MST. <br /> <br /> No superior production of drama deserves much better.
