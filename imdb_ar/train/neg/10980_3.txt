Really scary movie. Feels as if it were made in the early 1990s by a straight person who wanted to show that homosexuals were good, natural and ambitious from the mainstream. Back to the point of being abusive, LTR points out that monogamy and marriage are the preferred means of salvation for gay and sad homosexuals. Wonderful! Who knows? Supporting characters are the cartoons of gay stereotypes (luscious pomp, bitter queen, lonely poor, etc.) and the main characters are smoke, middle class, clones of the middle class, of little interest. <br /> <br /> With regard to the romantic and ideological conflicts of the main couple, there is not much to say: We've seen everything before, and we've done much better.
