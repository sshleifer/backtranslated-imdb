"Sleepwalkers" is the first film written by Stephen King. Given this, as well as the excellent Santo & Johnny song they used as a theme for the film, she would expect a strange viewing experience and eventually lead to a viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you will get. The thing, maybe they could have made it a good movie. The beginning is intriguing as it is a small town with a nervous atmosphere. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the film. The film turns funny for no apparent reason! Since that moment, the whole "Sleepwalkers" atmosphere has been destroyed. For those of you who have seen him, who can forget Johnny Well of old shouting "COP KABOB !!" After catching the pen in the ear of one of the policemen?!? But do not get me wrong, humor does not have a redefined quality. I hired the order again to see if I was wrong the first time, considering how much it looked like the original chart, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe they got the rights to the song Santo and Johnny. This was given 2.
