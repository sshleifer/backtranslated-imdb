I hired this movie and I expect some laughs, and hope it is enough to keep me enjoying but I was pretty much wrong. This film showed very few moments of humor and pathetic jokes made me ashamed to hire him ... For a target aged between 10 and 15 years, this film will definitely leave viewers outside these borders and feel completely dissatisfied. Not worth more than 3 votes is highly recommended for anyone who does not want to waste two hours of his life.
