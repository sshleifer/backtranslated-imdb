I was very surprised to see this movie enjoy a good rating, when I checked on IMDb after seeing it. This is already one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. It sounds like a good movie at first, but when I get into surgery, I could not believe how bad it was. This cross sound destroys everything! Just imagine that you are opening up like this and then listen to what he says. I saw the film in German, so I do not really know what he said in English, but the sarcastic things like "Yes, you did not hurt me"? ... What is that? Say yourself "Think of something else" then forgetting your pain once you think of your girlfriend is just stupid. And his mother ... how the hell is such a thing? Someone died to tell her, and her son died in surgery (what she had to expect). In addition she found some messages in Jessica Alves' s bag. In addition to "know the hospital" things ... and then take them "one second" to see it? what the hell? ^ ^ The end ... Why police bust them? The patient died in surgery, that's all. This drunken doctor does not know anything else either ... then clap them all, so friendly ??? why??? Despite all that I think Christensen did a bad job, this is not really for me ... these stupid mistakes and things I wrote about above are the problem. I saw this movie with some friends and we all felt very disappointed ... as I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... just do not watch it;)
