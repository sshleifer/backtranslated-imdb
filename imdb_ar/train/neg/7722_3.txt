A very poor action film championship starring Dolph Lundgren Wood and Brandon Lee being held in an outspoken role never seems to be clear. Work is at best the average, a little bit of nudity and addict, yes, Tia Carrera uses a double object! <br /> <br /> Setting up is the usual rebellious cop who is forced to break into a new partner in a big cause, and the designers try to at least give the formula a distraction that makes Lundgren the policeman with Oriental values ​​and Lee Lee contemporary in the modern city, Almost comedy, Lundgrens Oriental fighting group must be seen in the big showdown as a believer. The sequence of events is linked to numbers and Lee (who will continue to make the film The Crow) does not have room to show any special brilliance in martial arts. But given the tangible proportions he enjoyed, he must have been under a lot of pressure and it would have been far better not to have to rise to his father's level by playing a completely different role in The Crow, which showed what might be a unique actor who might become It was not because of his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of hardcore Lundgren or a fan of the motionless movies of the 1980s (think of Cobra and so on), then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 10/03
