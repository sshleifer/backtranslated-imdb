This must be the worst film I have ever seen. I bought a DVD and did not succeed, as well as the DVD was fine, and the film just was not, in fact so bad that I think non-actors have worked since (or before the referee of acting). There is no real conspiracy to talk about and no real horror. Production values ​​are nonsense even for a low budget film where it is difficult to hear some external scenes due to the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was so bad that the viewer thought he would turn into porn if you did not know which was better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie funny, both revolving around a transvestite bitch. (Although it's hardly worth seeing for 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As for marketing a DVD, I'm totally cheated. I mean back reading I was expecting to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victims. He chose his nose. I have turned into a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. The case also claims that it was digitally mastered, and I would like to see it in advance. The printing is so granular that you can use it as a sandpaper. The situation also says it's absolutely disgusting, in what way? , Production is disgusting, acting. <br /> <br /> This movie is still welcome in the first five minutes, (if you're thinking of buying this I'll say buy a "bad taste" instead is a much better and funny film, as it contains Peter Jackson's LOTR director .) By the way if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J. Matthews) and what they have done since then, please post here as I want to know, just to see if there is The worst movie out there, or if anyone in this movie bothers to learn how to act
