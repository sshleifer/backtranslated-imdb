This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Christopher Lee is good but barely in it, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is a really bad film, I stopped watching it close to the end, it was so bad, just for dark hard film lovers who have the mind to endure this vomiting.
