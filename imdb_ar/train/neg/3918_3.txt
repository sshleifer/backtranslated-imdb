Perhaps this film was the biggest disappointment I faced in renting movies based on IMDb ratings. In general, I simply found that this film is second class. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is quite acceptable as Manu deals with superheroes and Mao Wu with his fun-loving character. On the other hand, Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so fake that I could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed in Halloween clothes, and was completed with a beard of $ 4.95. <br /> <br /> The special effects were also, although the "undead" in the cellar was good. The tongue of the trees looked like something of a wild flick in the 1950s, although Bove's shots from the point of view of the tongue were like Sam Remy's in the latest "Dead Evil" trilogy. The fireworks were exciting, and the final battle was as dim as possible. (In fact, this was very reminiscent of the "Lost in Space" episode where Robinson signed in a sandstorm and ....) The plot was not particularly original and was told countless. Times in the form of European tales. There was no suspense and no plot intrigues. In fact, you learn immediately as you know the characters that are good, who is bad, and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then sat down to type this review. The first thing I did was check the date of production. Yes, say 1987 ... and not the 1967 that I thought it might be. This is summed up to a large extent: the values ​​of production and foreign exchange are typical in the 1960s. The plot and motion seem to be older, because Hollywood actually produced some interesting and challenging films in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> ** From *****
