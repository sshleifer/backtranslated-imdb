If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it should be rubbish. This is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. Tony Scott's bad style puts shame in the direction of an interesting and somewhat incorrect story about Harvey Domino's life as a fugitive hunter. The story is completely intermittent and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the plot were absurd and unbelievable at all. It seems that all the scenes of the movement were loosely intertwined due to poor plot points and terrible representation. Kira Knightley gets totally naked in this one though. This is the only aspect of this film. If you want to see it naked, just roll back the movie for about an hour and a half and catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one ever sees this movie!
