I wanted to write about the story, but there was nothing. I'd like to quote a few strong dialogs from the movie, but "funny" is funny only for 5 minutes, then. I wanted to fain on the "constant thrill of guessing", but it was predictable like ... Umm mm, Yash raj (?). I wanted to talk about the movement of the seat edge, but I do not like cartoons so much. <br /> <br /> * Sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. People trying to commit suicide - promise that it will push you to the edge 2. Sado-masochists - This Movie More effective than the barbed wires worn by Silas guy in Da-Vinci code. 3. Persons looking for alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear that the audience that left the room seemed in a mood to kill someone. 4. Movie Pirates: More power to them. If any movies deserve to make the audience spend money to watch it - that's the truth. 5. Symptoms, most types of plankton and green algae - because almost all living organisms require a somewhat larger intelligence factor than the film offers. Subsequent Thinking: It is clear that the director of the film is of its kind. (I hope God is the only one of its kind .. one is enough) <br /> <br /> Things that can make this movie better: 1. Story 2. Dance Designer 3. A Screenplay Writer 4. Stunt Coordinator 5. Story (I have already said that?) 6. Out - Preferably a person who is mentally disabled (although even the challenged person could have done better) 7. Anil Kapoor = Mammal plague - Avoid at all costs 8. Legal warning - "Watch Yash Raj movies harmful to your mental health"? <br /> <br /> Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2, the English subtitle "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" - "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" - becomes "Im flirt In short, Tashan for me is like the Rubik's Cube - the cube is supposed to increase the player's IQ. Tachan is reducing your IQ, within a short time. Only 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. but that's just me. I could be wrong I've been warning you anyway.
