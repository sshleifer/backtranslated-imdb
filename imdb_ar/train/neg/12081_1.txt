Note to George Litman and others: "Riff of the Mystery Science Theater 3000" is "I do not think so, * Breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why did you look at" I liked "?", simply for the complete absurdity. So, "Well Well not!" On the whole, I would say that we should give credit to the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie. You really can not make fun of the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that it will be disowned. The performance of the drama club at the junior high school can be better. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying a book and reading Hamlet.
