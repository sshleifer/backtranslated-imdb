Yes there are worse movies out there. Most of them are made for fun, with the budget of the shoe chain, or as a television movie of the week, but even if this is a "movie of the week," it will not be more than two stars. It is a lousy film about a dangerous subject in which a abused woman escapes from the mud king to the protective arms of the wicked king. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her from the man, she will be at the front of the film and should not be at all). It has no suspense, no personal development, and a heroine can outperform the harsh onions. (I think she is washing her wedding ring on a boat with a self-contained tank instead of just dropping it into the ocean (where her body must be anyway) and having found her husband, indicating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that kill her almost .) I'm always surprised when I see the kind of overall high ratings that a film like this gets, and that makes me realize that Dr. Suss still has a huge market untapped by people who will be challenged by his work. After I finished laughing at humanity I cry.
