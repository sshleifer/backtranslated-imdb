Deathstalker was directed by John Watson, starring Rick Hill, who is a kind of body builder and so famous, if understood correctly? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from the evil Lord, and he must travel to the Cave of the Lord. Many dwarfs and monsters meet during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a great success for Conan, and although this movie is very stupid, it contains many nice trash features and is recommended for trash lovers and tolerates movie addicts! <br /> <br /> There are not many movie theaters in this movie. A couple of scenes are almost fantastic in the air, but what Deathstalker focuses on to show, is the nude female and huge Hill muscles. Female victims are usually helpless and very stupid, so, this film is very muscular and thus may not satisfy many feminists! Fighting scenes are not something special and very boring, and monsters are not either something special. All other aspects of the film are too distorted and poorly executed, but what would you expect from a low budget effort like this? This tries to be as big as Conan but it fails miserably. As I said, this can satisfy Turkish movie lovers but no one else. This category belongs to a very bad category, it's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker was not nearly as bad as it could be, and a movie of turkeys, I appreciate this almost like other turkeys, certainly fun of course! If the bad movies are your cup of tea, try doing it and enjoy it, but if you do not understand "bad movies", you have to get away. If someone can not afford a large amount of nudity, go away as well. There is more nudity here than violence, and because of these scenes, the film is rated R. Otherwise this may be a safe PG family movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
