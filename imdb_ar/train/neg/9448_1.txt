There are no replacement features, this film is garbage. Do not start funny jokes. The humor of children is pathetic, and the attempts of adult attractiveness add only an appealing lightness to the entire miserable package. Sitting with him with my children made me uneasy about what might come next. I could not enjoy the film at all. Although my baby, whose DVD was purchased, enjoyed a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. Get recurring requests for return.
