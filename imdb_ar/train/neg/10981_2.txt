Or listen to, for this matter. So the sound is bear. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I have seen (it will be regarding Billy), but it is near the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing pulls and pulls and pulls. It's not that the plot is not valid - in the hands of a good writer you may have succeeded. . . Surely it could have been more entertaining. There is not a single plot point you can not see ten miles down the road. The dialog is flat. Old jokes. To add insult to injury, they are full of two-dimensional homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or relationship between the two lines of presentation was possible, much less realistic. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact there is no evidence of why the threads are threaded to each other. . . We were only told they were in love. It's hard to tell if they have something in common and not sexually compatible. They love the same book? Hey? <br /> <br /> The representation is not quite bad, but the speed is too slow. I mean, Jarmusch almost - slow, but without quality Jarmusch. In fact, this will be a good metric for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid it.
