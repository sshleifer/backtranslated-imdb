Words can not describe how this story is completely stupid (and thus bad this film) is! Pasinger, Del Toro ... What are you thinking? So there is a shopping center and parking space is full. Basinger's personality begins to buy a cup of tea and some wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When you go out, the whole place is so empty that no one hears shots fired nearby? Although they live there, when they escape the bad guys, they go as far as possible and random instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? Come on !!! I will not go into the notorious Red Toolbox because others have done it before. Not to mention the way in which uniform thugs kill one by one. <br /> <br /> This is very stupid, and without a little logic, I can only warn you to watch it, it's a waste of time, frankly !!
