A portable, fragile camera was used to give the film a documentary appearance, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to feel motion sickness just to see it. It looked like a person with cerebral palsy carrying the camera (there is no offense directed at people with cerebral palsy, but I do not think you expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) The camera's work was so nauseating, so distracted that I My wife and I consider her irrevocable and abandoned after 10 minutes of torture. I checked some time later (they were on TV) and did not get better soon. I suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you've eaten!
