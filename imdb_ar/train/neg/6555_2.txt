So the other night I decided to watch the tales of the Hollywood Hills: Natika Jackson. Or power, passion, murder as it is called in the Netherlands. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was playing a starring role in it, and I thought he should say something about quality. Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> 1) The movie plot is really confusing. There are two lines of story going on simultaneously during the film. They only have something in common. Throughout the entire film I was waiting for the moment when these two narratives would meet together until the plot was clear to me. But still did not happen. <br /> <br /> 2) The film's title says the film will be about Natika Jackson. Well it is, sometimes. As he said, the film covers two different stories and the part of Natica Jackson is Luxor. So there will be no wrong address for this other address. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store in a place where no one can see it. By doing this, you will not waste 90 minutes of your life, as you did.
