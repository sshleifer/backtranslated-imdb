The poor and Bobby Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner party, adding a comment to the ongoing political debate. People just look at her and say, "Oh, what do you know, you're the star of Theodore Rex." How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be a star piece of this terrifying crap? Even young children will be in awe at this thing. Reminded me of a very bad episode of "Sigmund Sea Monsters". In fact, if you think about it, Sigmund was far superior to this. <br /> <br /> However, was it made? By attaching the product to an illegal substance before telling it? Watch this ugly abomination at your own risk.
