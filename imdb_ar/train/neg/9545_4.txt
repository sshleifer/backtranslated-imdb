Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack. Ripley, a government supercomputer designed to spot potential terrorists, follows him because Will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his bank account to pay for a classroom trip to play chess in Philadelphia. The neighboring neighbor who was working on his computer is repairing, has relatives in the Middle East sending money from their bank to the neighbors bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist relationship. Ripley has the ability to call missile strikes. Oh oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster and more aggressive pace than War Games in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has a lot to work with these days. makes sense. So, we are struck by the wonderful CGI movie on computer screens, and once Joshua, Ripley's pioneer, is found running, we are left to watch the computer against the computer and people swing, hope and pray. Oh-ji, omg-ji, and more hope that things will go their way. In other words, we are now watching a TV-type film, Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie. This is a lot better. <br /> <br /> But, we really have to ask ourselves: do we make computers very smart on any day, and in time, they will judge us? Hmmm .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: Nudity Number: Language: No.
