This was certainly the most stupid and rude film I have ever seen. I was tempted to turn off a VCR, but, as in a dazzling car accident, I literally found himself hating himself in every imaginable way and hampered him to the very end. I'm by no means horrendous to object to comedic imagery of sexual sex on the screen. Animal House, Burke, there's something about Mary, both American Pie Movies, and even the infamous Freddy Gott Vingrid, I found great fun on their rough terms. The spongy sponge bath of Mami Van Doren is the most dreadful aspect of naked aging since The Shining. The film was released and shot, with incredibly disturbing performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended, uselessly made me laugh once. The only useful purpose of the film is as an example of a textbook on how not to produce an overall picture. Oh, it will also serve as a good fertilizer in the garden.
