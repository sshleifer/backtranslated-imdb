I know I've already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not one of the old flaws of the Baby Boom generation, which grew up in a ribbed picture of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, and so on. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years old before my birth but I was delighted to discover Phil Silver's Bilko gently from BBC2. I wonder if I will enjoy the features of Steve Martin if I do not hear or hear about Phil Silvers - I do not know - maybe I will. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think this movie deserves '10' admit they have not seen the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If you watch the movie Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig, Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshu, Dino, Flashman, Zimmermann, Moline and others, I still believe Steve Martin's movie is a wonderful thing over "2" - I'll stand you a pint ....
