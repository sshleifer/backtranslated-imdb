I am reassured that I have already sat and watched this. I like independent movies, horror movies and everything is coma in general. But when you add ninga, you have crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this film have spent a wonderful time making it, then at least it was not a complete waste. You never know by watching it though. Script? are you kidding. the acting? I think the trees were fake. cinematography? Well, there must be a camera there. interval. I do not think there was any actual planning to make this film. This is a complete waste of time I will not prolong by commenting more.
