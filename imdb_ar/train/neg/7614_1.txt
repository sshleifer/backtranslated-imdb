This may be one of the worst movies ever produced, <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the man walks ... walks ... and walks (spoiler). There is about 15 minutes of walking only. What? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that there are a lot of lighting problems, and it's as if they've taken nighttime scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The representation was awesome. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took the people who were deported. <br /> <br /> Please, in order to love everything sacred, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to him. The Director must be subject to punishment through the War Crimes Tribunal for this conviction to the public.
