We brought this movie as a joke to a friend, and it could have been our worst joke to play. The film is hardly seen, and the representation is awesome. The worst child actor is ever used and gives Hasselhoff a substandard performance. The plot is shameful and at times we were so bored that we were wondering what the hell was going on. He tries to be awful in some places but it's laughable. <br /> <br /> Too bad
