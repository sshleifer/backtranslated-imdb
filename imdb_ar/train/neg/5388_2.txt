There's a good movie lying around here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: explore the ethical issues that a group of survivors of the end of the world may face. But logic is so confused that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (it is understood) paranoid to catch the mysterious airborne infection that has been eliminated by almost all humans. Yet wearing surgical masks sometimes, not others. Sometimes they are fanatical about eliminating any area touched by an infected person. At other times, they seem quite uninterested. <br /> <br /> Even worse, having survived a few weeks or months in this new world of murder or murder, these people always behave like the sum of news. They do not bother to assemble proper equipment or food. Fuel runs out forever in the middle of nowhere. Do not take precautions when interviewing outsiders. After going into rotting bodies for the entire human race, they are as emotional as protected contaminants. You have to wonder constantly how they could have survived for a long time ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> So when these Duyans stop feeling pain because of the ethics of their actions, it is impossible to take a serious self-search. Their actions must first have a kind of minimal meaning. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we must address Chris Bowen's potentially dubious abilities. It may seem that his portrayal of the arrogant young man James T. Kirk was shrewd when looking at him in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly the same note: arrogant and persevering. It is impossible to doubt that this represents his entire drama collection. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the movie looks excellent *. I've got a sharp and saturated look that really fits the Southwest American language. But this can not save really weak writing nor papery (nagging) characters. Even if you are a fan of this kind of world, you should save yourself from the suffering of watching Carriers.
