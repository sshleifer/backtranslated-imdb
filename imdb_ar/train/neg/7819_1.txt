This would be the worst film I've ever seen. Hmmm, well maybe tied up with Boogeyman then. Awful, really awful. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and failed to achieve them! I honestly can not think of one good thing. So here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Representation 2. Schema 3. The CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... Seriously) 4. Chart 5. Dialogue Finally .... 6 . <br /> <br /> There are a lot of unanswered questions, they did a long movie of 2:32 hours, and then they realized that they did not put Lex Luther and Superman in a scene together and had to settle for 3 minutes or they In fact they thought that no one would notice that the hero and the villain had a major screen time less than the son of Superman and a wealthy man who killed them? !! <br /> <br /> Was half of the budget spent convincing Kevin Spacey to do that? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why do not doctors ask "What do you want us to do?" He's a stranger! Jack does not know about his anatomy! " <br /> <br /> What happened in the past five years, was Superman away from technology to progress 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where did people who wrote good comments watch the movie itself? <br /> <br /> Finally, why? Just why? <br /> <br /> BTW, for those who wonder how Superman can lift an entire continent of cribonite, I think I discovered it ... <br /> <br /> Since Superman is not affected by kryptonite until he sees Something green in the rocks, it is clear that in the head. So the continental thing is that it only suppresses its fear of bright green rocks .... <br /> <br /> Either this or the writers are corrupt intelligence who did not think it was a fairly obvious mistake.
