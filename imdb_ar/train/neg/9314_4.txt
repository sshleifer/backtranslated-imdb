Well ... In general, this film was largely worthless, which is basically a horror film that ended up being more of a comedy. I rented this movie last night only when my friends and I went to the movies looking for a scary movie. This certainly was not what we were looking for, but he was satisfied with our humor. The actors in this film (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. Especially that girl Tracy whenever she was in a closed room to inform the clown to leave. They show almost no feelings and it is very clear that they are acting. And also when the clown looks at the black box paper and grabs Mark, he does not seem so scared that although the clown like he grabbed him and started attacking him. Seriously, would you just jog if you're chasing? I'll be jogging my life! (Although anyone can beat that clown because it looks like 300 lbs). Not to mention that the effects are not as great as it happens when clown head Susan's head in the woods, then whenever she threw her head up the room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise threw the head back. As in the previous man's comment, the beginning is meaningless at all, and I do not even see why it is included in the film. So what did this film do in 2003? The music made it look like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera does not look really professional. Half the time, it seems that the camera can not even stay fixed when it is supposed to be. Overall, I would say I enjoyed the movie. I would not recommend it even though you're trying to find something that scares you, but if you're looking for something that might be making fun of it or laughing at it, I would definitely recommend it.
