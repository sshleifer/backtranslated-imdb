This movie is just awesome. John Ritter do pratt is where 75% of actors deliver their lines as if they read cue cards, poor editing, a terrible audio mix (difficult to capture in places above the background noise), and a plot goes anywhere. I did not think I'd said that at all, but Dorothy STARTEN is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others who absorb more. Patti Hansen gave her lines eagerly to Ben Stein. I started wondering if they were not dead inside. Even the children of Bogdanovich are terrible (the oldest is definitely reading their lines of braid card). This movie is very terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until four years later. Please do not see it. If you see it on the TV menus, remove the cable. If a friend suggests you, you should reconsider your friendship. If your wife wants to see him, it's better to find another friend. I better take my eyes with arrows in the grass instead of sitting on this piece of trash again. If you can summarize this movie in one word, it will be: Suckotrocity
