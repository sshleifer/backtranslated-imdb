why me? Why should I be subjected to such a massacre for what could have been an interesting plot ?! At least if I can warn others, it will be useful. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this terrible film for a college course. Otherwise, you have looked at the summary on the back of the thing and directed clearly. The film was slow, saw little evolution of characters, and focused on the idea that the scary little white man could become wonderful if he was hanging around with a symbolic LA black man. <br /> <br /> Experience the stereotypical Los Angeles sense of stunning surface - watching the movie. Note, however, that this film does not reject what we thought of as "LA lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that originated from it.
