First, I would say that user comments alone left me crying from crying. One comment that bad SF movies become good comedy is correct on the label. Make the MST3000 command away from this command. <br /> <br /> If you look at ANGRY RED Planet as a fever dream for the 10-year-old comic book reader of 1959, you will get this requirement. All elements exist: pseudo-science, logical at times, often hilarious childish. The boy's attitude towards sex, where the captain of "gigolo" (a good appeal to that, men!) To look at the full-bodied "world" of hair until it turns red, no wonder the fire alarm does not start. The absurd concept of Mars as a planet is so strange that everything shines in red, yet a foreign beast has a mouse face, and a pulsing alien eye turns like a child's toy. Comic satisfaction, an overweight astronaut (!) Seems to have not completed eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his radiant pistol. And of course, just the fact that alien = evil is dangerous. If these persons have met e. "Ah" already! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I have rated this movie low. However, it is never boring (except when the world tries to explain everything - just to make everything look more ridiculous and more), and you have to recognize, in the heart of your little child, that it makes you jump several times. <br /> <br /> Well, do not accept it. I think you have never been 10.
