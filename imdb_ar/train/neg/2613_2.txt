This sequel is completely unequal and incoherent and wandering in the "plot" (if there is already) and trying to be very difficult to be modern (ridiculously second-century songs and songs of a predominantly artistic nature) and cute Of the jokes made and drawn with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the plot of events. Even Glen Claus (which is usually very good) is gripping this movie, mimicking itself as an original and original de Ville of the sunset! It's not a good film to look at. This is a very good example of a poorly meaningless supplement. Even the basic instinct 2 had a conspiracy, characterization and acceptable behavior. this, no. it's bad.
