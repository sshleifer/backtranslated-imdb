I accidentally caught this on the TV show - and could barely believe how utterly awful the whole experience was. In comparison, the original "horse-named man" was obliged to take the precaution because he kept his interest entirely. But this piece of nonsense - the words let me down. It was bad enough to give a kind of "story" to the whole effect of a wet bread loaf, but that was compounded by the apparent lack of translations all the time the word "Sioux" took place. For the sake of good, can not the filmmakers find enough North American Indians who were also representatives and semi-actors to play the role of Indians in this Fargo instead of the fraudsters who actually used it? I also found it very embarrassing to watch Richard Harris smiling across the countryside at the obvious request of the director standing directly behind the camera and asking him to run and jump from point A to pointless point B to pointless just to set up movie footage and minutes . Very terrible in all respects!
