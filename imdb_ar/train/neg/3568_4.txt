The truth is that the film based on Harold Robbins' novel will not win any prizes. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in the budget, implemented and implemented. Technically, it looks like a movie dedicated to television. Representation is very uneven. Joseph Cali is very terrible. Anthony Holland is embarrassed. As one reviewer said about a particular performance of Katharine Hepburn, her collection ranges from A to B. Ms. Zedora succeeds in reaching G. The rest of the actors are solid (and lost in their respective roles). Lloyd Bushner and Bobby Bush deserve the best. However, everything can be very enjoyable in a kind of garbage. As befits Rubens, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you're looking for some fun ... and you were not very alert ... it might be right for you.
