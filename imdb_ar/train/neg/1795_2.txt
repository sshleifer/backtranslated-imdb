I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of the test audience, and the only thing I kept in my seat was the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire after the test. I felt that the biggest problem with the film was its lack of a master plan. Instead, they consist of (also) many sub-pieces that compete for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character developed sufficiently for the public to create any type of attachment. What the director and the producer brought up failed to show is why we should care about what happens to the characters. In fact, any sub-plot and associated characters can be removed completely without damaging the film. (The time gained has allowed much needed development of the sub-sectors and the remaining characters). Simply put, the Hungry Bachelors Club is packed with side dishes and entrees when entry is required.
