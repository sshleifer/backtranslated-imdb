I can name a lot of funny movies. There's a comedy that turns out to be funny, and it is. Some movies, like Gymkata for example, try to be serious but ultimately funny. The Liddies Man is a film trying desperately to be funny, but can not be less funny if it concerns a person who got a lot of chicks amid the wreckage of the nuclear holocaust. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think I laughed more than a chuckle at anything in this film. It's simply tricky. It's dull, stupid, naive, annoying, bad-minded, but not funny. I do not care about Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I was expecting better. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or logic. It seems as if the screenwriter had a bag on his head while writing and could not see the keys he was hitting. They tell the "origin" of the ladies' man, but they fail to include the motive behind his curious fascination with acting as if he were still in the 1970s. The film tries to get the humor out of a man who seems to be happy with pornography, shortly after trying to hang himself. This is a comedy? I like to consider myself very humoristic (I spend a lot of time writing comics like I do), but maybe I'm not bright enough for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, very funny like Tucker in there is something about Mary, very bad here. I begged him in my head to silence. <br /> <br /> In the end I was checking my chair, muttering under my breath, and because the film had gone on for a long time, it was likely to try to commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen approaching. <br /> <br />
