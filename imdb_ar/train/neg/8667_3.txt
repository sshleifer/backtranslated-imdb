This game has a great ambience but it is better to offer more than speaking actors and talk about excitement. The first third of this film was only talk, and more talk. Most of that was a handful of women who upset each other for each other. <br /> <br /> The first five representatives listed here are women, so they can be seen as "flick" and so on. This may be running on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick kill scene and then more talk. By the middle of the road, they lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked at about 15 years here.
