I can not figure out how anyone could get a budget for such a bad movie. It's like a desperate TV station for anything, nothing at all. It is buried under a handful of snow, and the electricity lights up and closes, but there is a steady back light stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That, and all the stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to devise ways to survive. Try to create this sense of emergency and help people. But because it is poorly directed and represented, you will not repair your Florence Nightingale with this error. I join my negative feedback, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
