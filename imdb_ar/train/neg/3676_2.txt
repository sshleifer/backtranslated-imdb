Suzanne Swift is an attractive young woman, a girl planted in the 1980s (such as a young Susan Day), but she does not have the vocal range of dramatic progress and tends to moan. Still, sweet and has bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In "Advent" (as it was called when it was briefly put in the theaters), Swift may be a Salem reincarnation. The flick on the budget is very low and borrows from many other pictures I gave up with about 15 minutes to go. It starts strongly and has some appeal to the camp. There are obviously more serious films dealing with Salem's fascinating experiences that are worth seeing on this film; however, as unwanted movies go, it is not terribly terrible. The Boston languages ​​are a specific plus sign, and hammer cast support. * 1/2 of ****
