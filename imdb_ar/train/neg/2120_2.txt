I considered myself very sad, especially when I was watching great and moving films. But this is not one (which surprised me!) It is really amazing to see the number of people who highly praised this film. Despite the guilt - Ben Ryden's real intent to save 7 lives to recover his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this kind of suicide action . Some people may think that this is heroic work and others think he is behaving crazily. In the end, this was a worrisome job for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The story line is exaggerated, but the logic is very simplistic. Medically, the blood type is required to be organ donor. Near the end of the film, we learned that Emily had a background blood type that limited her chance of getting the donor within a short period of time. However, Ben seems to have had a rare blood type, just like her salary which allowed him to be a benefactor and comforter, despite the scarcity of the Benn family, was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidneys, horns and bone marrow The cases not only match the blood type but also the tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why are doctors allowed to donate organs in spite of the jellyfish he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I may have over-analyzed the whole story as if it were all just a movie. However, we hope that some of the troubling facts described above will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie. If you go for a kind of soap opera movies, do it. But you are seeking a smart entertainment, give this person a miss!
