I watched this movie and the original Carlitos way back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the package was made with a small budget, but it had nothing to do with bad texts. Maybe now I'm just, but I always thought that the pre-set work was done to start preparing the other film, the main characters' championship and maybe filling a bit of life that we did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie named Carlito. There should have been at least a few characters from the original film, and the ending does not end in any sense to the original. At the end of this film he retires with his beautiful heart, but how the hell to get him out of prison in the next film? His wife is not even the same woman he talks about as his only love at first. I would say that the film is moderately pleasurable in itself, with a few nice bits but dwindles when it is his older brother. Do not wake up at night waiting to see it, watch the original again if you really need success.
