I encountered many problems with this film. <br /> <br /> It contains some basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is good. Although quantum physics has existed for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a shocking way that seems to say, "Is not that just a blast!" Well, not really. This is not the revelation of earth breaking anymore. In any case, you are familiar with quantum theory, the fact that particles must be described by wave equations, etc. are not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I face with this film is how these people use quantum theory as a means to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spirituality. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spirituality, but quantum mechanics have nothing to do with these things and must remain separate. The people I met in this film start with the ideas of quantum theory and then they jumped to say that once you think about something you can change it around you, so you have to think positively so that we have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. The logic is quite ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow the quantum theory. For all the so-called "expert" they interviewed for this film, there are dozens of theoretical physicists who do not quite agree. They will rightly state that the unpredictability of the non-nuclear world does not support the ambiguous ideas about our spiritual interdependence. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people will see this movie and eat it completely up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. The main thrust of the film is based on the complete misinterpretation of quantum theory, which is bad in its logic, like any attempt to justify organized religion using similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah. At one point, one of the "experts" says that throughout history, most of the assumptions made by people around the world have proved wrong, so the assumptions we hold around the world may be wrong. Hey? This completely does not follow. Even if that is the case, I do not see how this helps his argument. I mean, if his ideas become common assumptions, I think we will have to assume that they are very wrong, based on his own logic.
