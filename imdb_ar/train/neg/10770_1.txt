May contain potential spoilers (not that anything new in this movie will surprise you moderately). <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything I've made in oblivion? It is certainly cheaper for them, but after a while, do not you think there is a universal quality and how people think about it. House Of Villains is a disgusting display of senseless animation transitions at all. Some of the signs of total disregard for previous movies in this are: Sounds do not match remotely with Iago is evil again (since when ?!) I know that these films are directed directly to children but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the film (which was Disney's specialty for years) is incomprehensible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone so young. All I can do is that if more movies are made of the same caliber, it's just a matter of time before the small animation studio beats Disney on a grand scale.
