How wonderful. Another film about America by someone who has probably visited here a half dozen times, every day a piece, is believed to be the "expert" in the country. Shish. I have to make a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and produce a film about Germany, "the land of the Nazis" or some of them. Wim IL boy, you should meet Lars von Trier and make ULTIMATE for Americans. Of course we all know that it takes an ambitious left-leaning "we the world" Europeans to make a "real" film about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true. For a continent that has not started a single continent but two global players, Europe certainly has a lot of opinions about the wrong American "foreign policy." <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, Mr. Wim, there are a lot of Americans from the University of California at Berkeley who will love your film. Of course, these are the same people who think that George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that the plate of soup soup is "pure genius" !!
