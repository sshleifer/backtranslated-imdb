I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and I absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical love story set in the 16th century when the Western countries were a journey from London several days and law and order was more difficult. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes many liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The values ​​of representation and production are fine, but the way in which the story was messed up was appalling. Why TV adaptations do this? Why do they think that thousands of book lovers want them to change the story ??? One of the great secrets of life !!! The BBC made an excellent broadcast on Christmas in the early 1990s and I'm still trying to trace a copy of it! Take my advice, read the book and do not care about this trivial version!
