There are similarities between the film "Jindabyne" by Ray Lawrence and his last film "Lantana" ?? The dead body and its repercussions on a life already dysfunctional. But while "Lantana" showed some hope and a solution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will make most viewers unhappy and even cheated. <br /> <br /> Story of the story - following the discovery of a hunter of the corpse floating in a distant river - based on a short story written by Raymond Carver. He became a member of the classic Robert Altman band in 1993 "Short cuts". Lawrence uses this subject to explore and present relationships within a small Australian community under pressure. The film raises some ethical questions: "Do you allow the discovery of a dead body at the end of a good week?" More exciting for the Australians, "Will there be any difference if the deceased person is an indigenous?" Representation, especially by Gabriel Berne and Laura Lennie, is commendable. There are elements of mysticism supported by haunting music, unlike "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds mainly for a wonderful movie - prepare for the disappointment, too slow and shows the murder near the beginning, thus eliminating the mystery element. So we are left with these desolate souls and an empty end.
