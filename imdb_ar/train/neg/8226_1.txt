Given that many horror films are based on the assumption that one or more central characters do something stupid at some point during the proceedings, the girls will collect gold, silver and bronze in the Olympic Darwin concert. The mentally disabled baboon had made better choices than he did and was screaming much less while doing so. <br /> <br /> If you like life-like films, do a camcorder deliberately (92 years old) Old Jeddah has a video camera with better results), a very bad voice and no identifiable plot / novel, this is your movie ideal. Also note that you should enjoy the following: Women cry without reason, women grind without reason. In fact the reason and the logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "We have to find Stephanie" "Yes I can not believe I was talking to her, like, last night" "I called you last night?" "Yes, I wanted to talk about a certain date when I got one question." "What? How did you not tell me?" As in, our friend is chased by a serial killer with a gun and a bunch of dreadful weapons, but I have a problem in the fact that she did not tell me she was going on a specific date. <br /> <br /> Well, so the budget is low. This does not mean that you have to make it seem like it costs half the budget. The "result" is interesting because all the tracks - with the exception of one track - have been written and executed by the same movie writers / directors. In fact, the entire budget seems to have been influenced by sampling the song "The Duskfall," a death squad from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the entire movie is the ending that leaves us with the possibility of sequel.
