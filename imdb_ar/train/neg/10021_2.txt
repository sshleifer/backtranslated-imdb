The worst movie I've seen since Terra Gado is Ghal Chal. There is no story, no humor and nothing! The action strings look like a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads that have been combined. I was very impressed by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but I implemented it very badly. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much speculation, but watching this movie is an outrageous experience that makes you wonder, "What were these guys thinking ?? !!" <br /> <br /> The only thing you may remember after watching it is Karenic with anorexia in bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I did not give an '1' rating is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong.
