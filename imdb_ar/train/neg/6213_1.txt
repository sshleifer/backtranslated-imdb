Make this movie one of the top 10 awesome movies. terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no continuous moment where there was no fight with a monster or another. There was no chance to develop any personality, they were too busy running from one sword to another. I did not have any emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine I wanted to destroy). <br /> <br /> The scenes were blatantly stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene was finally stolen from the last scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br /> The Spider was initially like the Frodo attack by the Spider in the Return of Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait ... ... he sleeps (bites) his victim and concludes ..... oh hi ???? <br /> <br /> And the whole machine against the subject of humans is the matrix .. Or the Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples but why waste time? Will someone tell me who was with the Nazi?!?! ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> There was a story line of events rushing to the end of events. The film could not determine whether it was a children's film or an adult film and not much. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.
