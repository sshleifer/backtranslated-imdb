When I go to watch the movies, I would be awake or watching, or if I did not like it, I would sleep, but that was pure nonsense, I actually got up and went out! Together, his hatred. Also, they did not have to take out Brendan Fraser, it was much better. This was not as good as I expected, bearing in mind that I loved George George from Forest 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first one, like a bird, and when I ever crashed on a tree. I hope the manager takes this into account, and his upcoming movies, needs to be reconsidered ... Horrible! I really like to give Ursla a well done job, because it made the movie worthwhile (until I came out) ... In general, I give this movie 2 out of 10
