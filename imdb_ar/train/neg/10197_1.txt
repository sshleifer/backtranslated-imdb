Totally silly. If you know anything about poker, you will find it very shocking but also entertaining because it is useless. The student who filmed this film is obviously very religious and knows little about poker, but I doubt he ever played above 3-6. (I think he knows nothing about golf.) Where to start. I have seen better production in the "Introduction to Cinema" chapter. The actors to watch in this film are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen, and the loser who can not win in poker. Everyone else is as enthusiastic as the bad porn actors. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The man who starts the movie in the opening series is the only reason the film makes it. He is a footballer who does not play poker and has no line of dialogue at all, but the actor is the man who paid for the film. I can not think of wasting more useful money than this man who bombed this useless production. It is appropriate to have such a useless role. <br /> <br /> There is very little poker in this movie. Most of the time is spent on useless side profiles whose schemes are not resolved at the very least. Queen Moma has a robbery scene where her losing boyfriend throws through a window and tries to shoot at his brains. The anonymous Arabs at the store also offer wonderful shows when they discuss whether they will beat or kill an elderly woman who steals them. Their performance is easily hidden among the highlights of the film. It makes you wonder why they bothered all those white people in role-playing. <br /> <br /> In the end, complete nonsense. Plan 9 of outer space has a little more coherence. If you play poker though you may want to laugh. Also if you are a Christian, you may enjoy a heavy, film-like religious conversation like the useless pepper. I hate movies made by religious people. Especially those who think they know something about things they know nothing about. It is sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen have been involved in this farce, where I can only think about it. You must be envious of Johnny Chan for the Rounders.
