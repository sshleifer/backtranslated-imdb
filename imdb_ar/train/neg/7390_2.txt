How do you spell Italian fat that can barely get out of the martial arts movement without the need for some heart medications? In this film, Steven Seagal sees his lowest achievement - since the beginning of his career, there has been a steady decline in pathetic behavior on the indulgent behavior that has corrupted his career. In this film, it seems that most of his training consisted of ordering fetuccini alfredo in his restaurant every day. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old-fashioned in this film, he is hardly a martial arts hero, looks like a stocky joker. <br /> <br /> It's time to retire Steven Seagal - this movie is about two hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Plot: A fleshy Italian man enjoys a great reputation for the wind power that a crime group may play around with drugs designed by the army to create a final warrior response. This pretense, though pathetic and laughable, offers the opportunity for some high-profile scenes of blasting across the walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> Did you mention this movie sucking it completely, and Steven Segal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
