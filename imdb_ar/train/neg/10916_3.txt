For local audiences, I can see how I pay tribute to this film. For outsiders, with no special interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and Russians as heroes. The supposed romantic angle was superfluous. How the young woman "liked" the lieutenant from just looking at him was nonsense. How she managed, as mentioned at the end of the film, never to marry because of this fascination that was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as stupid and this was manifested in the chase in the marshes. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. The Russians hid and the Germans stopped on the edge of the marshes and stood there just listening. I suppose they did not want to wet their shoes, but I'm sure an officer ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to look for marshes. But that would end the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the upper floor and did not disturb the shooting on the roof. In the worst case, some soldiers threw a hand grenade in the upper floor and did not climb up the ladder. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers who said they cried in the end. I wonder why? You know that this small band will perish and have no heart-dragging.
