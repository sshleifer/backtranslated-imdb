I rated this movie on 1 because the plot is incredibly incredible. Judge for yourself. Be careful, Valtali will not only abandon the plot, but also spoil your appetite to watch the film. <br /> <br /> The computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends a code through television screens and computer monitors. When you enter the code - in the form of light - into the eye, it can access the "electrical system" of your body. What he does is to force the body's cells to secrete calcium. Within seconds after the patient reaches his neck and develops a tunnel vision, his skin will turn white to calcium, and then his hand will fall and his skin will split into a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is highly intelligent. When he discovers that a blind computer expert is trying to decode using a Braille output device - operated by hand - the device is too high, causing severe skin lesions on the head of the expert. The virus also senses aggression against the remote controls and the keyboard of the ATM. Fortunately, it can be stopped by throwing old desktops into a rack and storing electrocution with a backpack on a broken computer and feet in some leaking water. <br /> <br /> My dear ...
