I admit - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any human creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the height of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a clear text. <br /> <br /> Compare Gwyneth Paltrow's version is inevitable - this version is much more faithful to the ingenious spirit of the book and more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here - Kate Berkensal (who has already played Flora Post at Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's most intelligent spiritual twin Emma) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes Frank Churchill appropriate. The production is wonderful, but the interior design is very dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are many major problems. The first is Mark Strong - first of all, he does not seem to fit Mr. Knightley. Maybe that's because he plays a role like the Victorian Parsons. it's so bad. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the length problem. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right kind of feeling, it must be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, more importantly, there is quality adjustment. Austin is a dream transformer - every dialogue already exists. Just needs to pruning and arranging them properly. Andrew Davis seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma must be on is gloomy. More importantly, Davis saw fit to rewrite the end as a kind of holiday. From any planet, or secondary work to Thomas Hardy, this comes from? It is completely out of style and spirit of the novel. I think it's supposed to dramatically try to make improvements - perfect. <br /> <br /> Watch the Paltrow version or see Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
