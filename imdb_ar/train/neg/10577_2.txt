Some of the filmmakers involved in the series have made some really great films, but they are sure they do not show much skill in this series. Especially writing. Well, the first season was a bit better, but these new episodes are just stinky. I am a fan of horror, and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Few are visually creative. It's just typical Hollywood nonsense fabricated, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived and in some cases, laughable. Like so many tales of a crypt, the only good thing that this series offers is great nudity! Other then this series blows hard. I have the impression that sometimes they hired a bunch of eighth grade students to write episodes. Maybe they did.
