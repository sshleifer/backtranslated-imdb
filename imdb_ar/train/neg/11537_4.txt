I've been following these movies for a while so maybe I was expecting very little. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and were interested in seeing what Dan Reed could find, but unfortunately, it did not work out for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand the type in which it occurs, and therefore fails to influence the elements of drama, horror and excitement because instead of focusing on one of them and doing well, it is part of the socket of all professions And the master in nothing. <br /> <br /> The premise (as with most vengeful films) is simple, the couple get together and come out, something bad happens and they get revenge. It's a simple formula and a lot of formula for the directors I've dealt with over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, it looks like Dan Reed, "It would be nice to do a revenge film that deepens a bit by showing a more humane side to all the characters and deepening her mental state in more detail .." Wrong! There are also some basic elements lost, in this type of film there is generally a kind of warning. Do not do this or this element may add to the tension but there is nothing like that here. It happens simply, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and ends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of really intense competition in this type of hats and Dan Reed on his experience, I have no problem in his abilities but in the writing period ... I would like to say next time that he must adhere to the formula of type The film he makes instead of trying to be very smart and he will get a good film hands.
