Whatever the rating I give BOOM it is only because of the photography of the wonderful location of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts from ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its downstream phase), and Richard Burton (his faulty phase). Tennessee Williams writes, "The milk train does not stop here anymore," and he is supposed to be very fond of this modification in his play - but it seems he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated her and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> In any case, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor in the fumes and nausea, explodes in the servants and exchanges bad talk with her baby. Of NOEL COWARD who appears to be a guest of another film when he finally appears. <br /> <br /> He is so much a camper that among Taylor fans, he may be considered a sort of "must see" thing. But if you can sit through this without drinking in your hand, then you are on my way in front of me. Unfortunately, this is a film that shows Taylor's end being seriously as a film actress, even after winning the Oscars. For Burton, it was both disastrous and described by critics as a bomb. Judge for yourself if you dare.
