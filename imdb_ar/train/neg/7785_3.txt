I did not know that this is a silent movie with narration. I do not care about silent films - kind humor, low lighting, movies, etc. I'm sure the low qualities that you set them. It was about chapter eight before I found any interest in this story, and if I got popcorn, I threw it on the screen. Perhaps this appeals to the scientific crowd? The only thing missing is a coma scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there was a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rossellini narrated this film - the fun part of the film. No one is left to comment on how much they enjoy it and the unusual approach is not in the narrative. I can not recommend this film.
