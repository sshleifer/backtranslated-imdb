As a previous submarine, this was one of the worst submarines I've ever seen. First of all, an insurrection on board any US Navy ship, especially a nuclear-powered submarine, is unthinkable. These guys are the best, dedicated to their mission. Their responsibility is enormous, and they take it seriously from the captain to the most junior crew. I could never see a crew from any ship dividing their alliance between the captain and the chief executive. The executive officer who played the personal role played by Denzel Washington will be relieved of his duties and the military court, then a drum of the Navy. It is not surprising that the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help make this film. Finally, if any member of the submarine crew makes noise on the ship, they will be strongly reprimanded. Divers early in their careers learn to be as quiet as possible to avoid being discovered. They do not close the doors, they talk quietly and wear soft-soled shoes at work. I was amazed at how they loudly voted for the crew as he walked. Loud music will not be tolerated. I know that filming the life of the submarine will not actually sell movie tickets, but it ended up being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
