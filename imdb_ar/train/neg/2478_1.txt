This movie is S-L-O-W. Most of the film was spent waiting for him to actually "start". The script was bleak, the film was grim, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not all this low-budget movies were bad, but this movie did not contain recovery features). <br /> <br /> The piece was more consumed with a little Wendy-type, real-time, self-deprecating angler who made a very short look at the end of a movie. This in itself was disappointing because this "Wendigo" was just a strange mix of tree and deer. Everything about the film was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The parents of the little boy appeared to be at times completely separated from their son. Whether it's bad representation or bad script, I'm not sure, but it has increased disappointment and boredom levels. <br /> <br /> There was no food to think about and nothing interesting. With no intrigue or real cold factor, this film screamed very painfully, and you can not care what happened by the end. <br /> <br /> The Wendigo atmosphere reminds me of the blunt film at the awards ceremony towards the end of "Mr Bean's Holiday": a senseless, senseless film that tries hard to be profound and meaningful, but it encounters a longing and boredom. <br /> <br /> I would never want to see this again. I saw it to the end in the hope that something interesting would happen ... but it did not happen.
