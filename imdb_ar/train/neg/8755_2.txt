This film was terrible to say the least. I was hoping to get much better after seeing High School Musical. The entire film was "The Simple Life," but it was not a real show. <br /> <br /> The acting was not good at all. Amanda Mikalka was passing by when she was not so bad. On the other hand, Alison Mikalka was bad all the time. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's interest in love, was playing a young Frenchman, but it was a terrible tone. One of the good things about this movie is Michael Trevino, who is fully loved, who played Allison's attention with love. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie has been broadcast before "High School Musical" will not sound bad. But they were not compared. <br /> <br /> In general, give it 2.
