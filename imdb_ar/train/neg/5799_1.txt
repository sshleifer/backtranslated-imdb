I hired this movie yesterday because of the beautiful art and the summary presented on the back of the jacket. After putting it in the DVD player, I re-examined the cover cover and although I removed the cover from the plastic projector, I could not read any of the production details about the film. This movie is titled "Evil on the Jacket" and I had to locate it by going to the Faith Films web site to find out anything related to it here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The images and special effects in the movie look very good ... Then, the representative of the reading line spoke. My dear ... It seems that reading this actor looks like a high-schooled jock whose voice managed to change the pitch, and did not give any attempt to bypass reading the lines from the text. At first I thought I got a bad CD of audio sync, and then I had to believe it was a foreign film because I could not read the cover ... English dialogue Madbalij. If they portray the right person to dub the dialogue, this film may be appropriate. I gave her a chance for about 20 minutes before she took it out when she found out that the bad line reader would not get rid of it, but it was always fixed. Yes, it is so bad! The cover of the artistic cover and the art that was accomplished in the film are wonderful, so they gave one star, but minus as many as 1999999 stars in the corrupt dialog box. I do not recommend this!
