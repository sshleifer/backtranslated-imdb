I do this based on my observations about one episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I will watch again. The representation was completely wooden, the plot quite predictable, and the result is completely unrealistic - I mean who will believe a $ 30 million judgment on the death of a recovering addict recovering from cancer with a final cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed very uncomfortable, almost embarrassed by his role - perhaps realizing how bad the writing was !! I realize that the drama of this season is very bad, but surely they can find a better book. Maybe they are outsourcing writing to India or China! I bet we will not see this next season!
