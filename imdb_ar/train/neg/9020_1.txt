I kept myself wrong by waking up last night watching this thing. The only thing I can say well about this terrible film is that it can be used by movie schools to show how not to produce a movie. No appropriate personal development, wait, I'm not sure they are characters. The controls were irregular and unfamiliar, and excessive use of split screens was neglected because they were sometimes unable to synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would. Unfortunately, not even worth the time for some laughter. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of the money that Hollywood wasted, and now I waste my time even thinking about it.
