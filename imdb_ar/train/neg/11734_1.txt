tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the film. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what to do. It seems that his story is written, without any knowledge of Iowa's culture and the problem of the dead. I know that Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film more perplexing to me. Why two main characters dialects? This makes no sense. Acting was mediocre at best and sometimes difficult to watch. Mysterious violence and sex filled the film. I think violence and sex were supposed to make the film thrifty, but it happened to be unreasonable and humiliating. The end of the film is so bad that all I can do is laugh and look at the credits traded in disbelief. As I walked out of the theater, everyone was leaving laughing at me. The end of the film was supposed to cause tears, but it did the opposite. Do not waste your time in this terrible movie, unless you want to see the ignorant, happier drive, exaggerating the cliche.
