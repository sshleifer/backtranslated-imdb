Invasion of the Star Creatures will certainly be in the category "Very Bad, It's Good" if the film is not sexually or racially biased. This makes it very bad. <br /> <br /> He has the same kind of extreme sexual discrimination that I have seen in the Outer Space Queen, and the type of racial stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans) that are usually found in the 1930s and 1940s by Westerners. In terms of being non-funny, the same walk-through walk through the cave is repeated more than ten times during this fairly short film. Ray makes a good impression on Jimmy Kenny (but can not make him work for two impressions of Kani in a row, and does not deal with Peter Laurie when he tries). There are no production values ​​to talk about, because "Star Creatures" makes Rob-Monster of Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 of Outer Space look like creations from Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly one of the vanguard of what you should call early independent cinema ... not enough for theatrical art and not good enough for anything but the last feature of driving the car all night long. <br /> <br />
