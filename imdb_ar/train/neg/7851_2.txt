As we have mentioned countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is not a new version of the sequel of the mid-1980s to the original Wes Craven version of 1977. But this postmodern supplemental remake, after being remodeled in the form of declining revenues, Craven himself (a double threat along with his son Jonathan) decided to choose a film of the same quality - in simple English, terrible. The former director of music and video, Martin Weiss, takes over Alexander Aga's head, clearly on his head - yet one wonders how anyone can create a famous film from the Cravins 101 screen. Not only the characters (in this case, National Football (wo) to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) is obnoxious and prone to really annoying type pitfalls (played without licking derision, blocking you), but they constantly break jokes that are not funny. After seeing the complete uncertainty during the training exercise, their fate against the carnivores became painfully clear. This time only - as in the original 80s supplement - the script is very simple (barely existent) so that any potential subtext in favor of pre-ants is removed in abhorrent shocks (we deal with the birth of a combo) - during the opening credits period, In addition to the unjustified rape of those who did not take out the DVD by mid-term!). Even the mutants in this trip are personal-free whims not an unforgettable niche - it seems that the make-up FX is a thorny rubbery appearance, like the rest of the film, trying to hide his face from embarrassment. I was really impressed by the lame "surprise" at the end of the excellent Aga film, otherwise the producers would literally go to the end at the end of Hill 2, paving the way - stage the stage three times. The Batch ... However, Cravens and Weisz have created such a cynical cast, making versions of 1977/2006 so hard to squeeze to find an audience after this humiliating slap in the face.
