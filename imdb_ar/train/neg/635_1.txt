Louisie Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in Good Good. Unfortunately, her role was not required. She did not say much and appeared pale throughout the film. Louis was a slave and then married to Paul Mony (he did a great job). In ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but they were very masked in their roles. I hope Paul Mony won an Oscar for his performance, because that's what Luis should get from Oscar. Breakthrough must be represented, one of the first of the method already. This sounds like something you do Hollywood often. I have played Al Pacino Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luis's performance was dull all the time, and when she died, she did not change to express any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film. She only changed her expression or passion twice. If the wonderful acting is accurate, I suppose I have not seen him.
