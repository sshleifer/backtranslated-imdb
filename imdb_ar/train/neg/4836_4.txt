Let's start with simple lines. By the viewer, there are some good "director details" and some views in the movie scenes are nice. The special effects are good enough, good scenery / good representation too. But the story is very simple. It shows how the unit of the army's bomb squad lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows a drama to live in war. In my cinematic experience as a dangerous movie "addicted", I missed that click that makes my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. One of the things you need to be present in a film in order to take it well is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality of the film and its time. This did not happen to me. She remained "conscious" of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I think this film has gained its place in fame based on the "unconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and real feeling, but not enough use as the film's birth generator. More than a film about the war, his popularity is growing accordingly. <br /> <br /> A simple idea: if this is a world war or I'm a film, time will change only when everything stays the same, would it be granted? Make sure not. why? As there are a large number of awards that raise the level to the highest level. <br /> <br /> Compared to its Oscar winners, I do not think all the prizes you have won have been awarded properly.
