He was convincing the world that he did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is the line that many people may remember. He is one of the usual suspects of course with regard to Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I got another one like: - The dumb trick the director ever made was trying to convince an audience that he actually had a story - <br /> <br /> This is one of the harshest films I have seen in a long time. It starts well, with a really wonderful cinematography, a wonderful acting and a very smart idea. Unfortunately, the only way this film is directed is on the path of self-destruction. They do this, not just one blow, but with a little cuts on the wrist. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that are amazed by the fact that they have found a way to explain this donut. With enough fat in my mind, I may be able to explain the existence of the human race very reasonably. I've seen and read about ten completely different ways to explain people's story. It differs from a story that takes place entirely in the head of someone, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way of a criminal who attacks his enemies through chess-like games. <br /> <br /> All this swells Jolie. But at the same time, from the painful gift there is something terribly wrong in this story. Apart from that, it is in no way a sharp decline in the number of films and books such as "Fight Club, Bill Kell, Casino, Usual suspects, Sanchez, Magnolia and Schoenauville." We do not deal with gentle borrowing here. <br /> <br /> What happened in the end is the error in this film is that the story of the film revolves in the form of drunken in speed.If this film is a circular journey, gravity may hit his side after a few takeoff, there are many changes in the This film, which will never be solved, and that if it is a cocktail, you will need buckets of rodents to work on nausea after drinking Nothing is explained at all, and when you finally get to understand the direction you think it's going, you'll get another one. <br /> <br /> I think this story was nowhere on paper and Richie should have thought It's great to take a movie out of it anyway, being the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or completely violating the work of the individual (Richie: ask for professional help.) What could easily be a jewel Instead it becomes an inventive piece of art, a food for pseudo-thinkers to discuss in afternoon discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> Keep your spirit and your stomach, and avoid it at all costs!
