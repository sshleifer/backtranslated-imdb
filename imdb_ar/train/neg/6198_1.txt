This cowardly and offensive film fascinated me. Characters are the familiar males of young people who are frequently displaced and seen as they wander bored in a seaside town. Robert Gharib but possesses his music that can be his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert in a maniac who sets out on a journey to cannabis and ecstasy and enters with the wrong crowd. It seems that Clay believes in "chilled madness" and ends Robert's role as rapist in murder. One wonders about the experience of this young director in real life. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that British youth are out of control. There is a very inaccurate connection to Iraqi insurgents. During the unnecessary rape, we were subjected to explosions and images of war. The film appears extreme by a group of male peers pushing to its limits. The young bombers in London draw on Clay's hateful portrayal of the modern male. Clay means that men simply can not help themselves to commit horrific acts of violence. It is surprising that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that call for such controversial propaganda, while in London we are still suffering from recent attacks. This is Clay's first movie, and I would be happy if he had another movie of his.
