I looked at the other comments and I was totally delighted to find that it was clear that the people who had already worked on the film had been suspended. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, reduce it. "Open" is just over the top. This is a Boston-based production college that does not achieve even the most amateur college movie level. This is what a group of children expect. The film is a silly movement without much creativity. It's very funny if you're ready to ridicule it. It's not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson College.
