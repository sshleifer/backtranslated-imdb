While being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me a wise idea, I know very well what was there first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original section of "Incoming Student" and being very happy. It was funny, sexy, wicked, all the main requirements for a movie in the car. You have to remember that this was released and released before all the rest ... animal house, pork, etc. ... So in his own way, this jug was really before its age. For whatever reason, the film was delivered to the major distributors who edited the original half of the movie, and then it was edited (should I say "mixed?") The most random scenes ever. The chubby guy, with goat heads .... What the heck was all that ?! I'm sure it was introduced to get an additional T & A, but it was a very slow paced, causing nothing to happen before it grinds to a screaming and painful stop. But all in all, it is a pleasant memory for me ... especially since I can say that the worst film I have ever seen ... I exist!
