1999 will decline in history as the film critic leads to misguided public opinion. At first they sent us to wide eyes. They then prepared BLAIR WITCH and now MAGNOLIA, the worst film of the year. what is he talking about? Who knows heck. Her full of self-indulgence and loaded bad disposition. I always wanted to stay and watch the balances, but when that was over, I could not get out of the cinema quickly enough. Most of the audience who attended the show I was in, felt the same way. Dates were arguing with each other as well as outsiders. It is ugly and hateful and will make you feel ugly and hateful.
