That's true. A film written, directed and produced by Farid Tepper and his family. (Fred was supposed to know better, having worked in the "Titantic" and "Dogma" groups.) So, the plot. There are some scientists, some forest guards, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are all very bad in their jobs, including the hot chick (who I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears bikini). A forest guard comments that scientists are "professional people", which is good, because it would be terrible if they were professional larvae, gels or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They walk in the forest in search of them. Some bones resemble exotic monkeys, and no one ever mentions that bones may be those in Bigfoot. They only roam and one of the guards beats without hesitation on the hottie. We all hope to die soon soon (with his sister, who is supposed to be naive but nice, but really annoying). Then, * the moments *, find Sasco ... I mean, the land of the tomb of animals that resemble a monkey. Of course, do not mention that it may just be Bigfoot bones that mess it out ... I think scientists and forest guards do not think about those kinds of things. <br /> <br /> Then Sascoch and the tribe really get angry and kill all the people we hate, chasing the other losers and burying his grand aunt Morel and his cousin Josh (who died in a regrettable Trout incident) again. <br /> <br /> A gloomy and boring dialogue (I've chosen several times), an unfamiliar plot, disliked characters, bad CGI (a man wearing a monkey suit will look better), and that acting was not very good, all you have to do is make I will never see a movie again. <br /> <br /> You can check it though; it's good for some unintended laughter.
