I watched the copy of Peter Jackson from Lord of the Rings when I was halfway through reading the two towers and thought it was absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> At this time the animated version of Lord of the Rings was released. In DvD but I told myself that I would finish reading the towers and returning the kings before watching it (as I thought it showed a full trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea because it was very nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was bored a lot for 20 minutes and it was so strange because I loved the book and annoyed me that the maker of this movie could even think of installing at least 1 and half books in an 8-minute film for two hours. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had any emotion when they spoke and seemed to read it from the page, so my favorite character, Gandalf, showed no interest at all. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only solution in parts of the film except the orks (looked awful) and drew Aragorn and Sam. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released because there was not until the end of the occasion, but maybe it was good that the moneymaker ran out because the film could not make any improvement. <br /> <br /> I hope that no one will judge the books of this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
