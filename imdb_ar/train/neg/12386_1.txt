It is difficult to make an unbiased judgment on a movie like this that has had a significant impact on me at this early age. This is without a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film. I was sad enough to see this film for the first time in my youth, and I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever. Then I saw him again earlier this year and I felt terrified again. <br /> <br /> I'm not fanatic or someone to say what others should see and should not see, but I have committed a great crime for the way there is something horrible and rape has been dealt with in this film. I love lowbrow cinema but this is just bad. Rent some Ross Meyer instead.
