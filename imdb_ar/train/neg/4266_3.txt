Sure, NADAD has some of the best scenes of horseback riding, swords, and a depiction of the scenery you're likely to see, but that's not what makes the film good. It helps but the story has to shine in the forefront of these things. Here Nomad wanders around. <br /> <br /> The story is streamlined, giving it the feeling that it has been assembled together simply to make a "wonderful" movie that looks great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the area where this story takes place (they are clearly clear with names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to involve us in a culture like the Gujars and the Cazaks, they curse the actors / actresses who look at the best part. Attention to the love that separates "our heroes" is all touched but with little impact and screen time, so that most viewers clean them aside for the next battle sequence, the next horse scene, or the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> Note that there were some important changes made to Nomad during his filming, namely the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergey Bodrov and replaced by Oli Steiger (cinematographer) Dan Lauston. In one sense, it seems that Luston had the best eye because his vision of the land made the final disagreement we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the transition to Podrov as a director may not be the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on battles rather than on people, which I feel comes from Budov's eyes and not bystanders. Real counterfeiting. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that it could have been a really wonderful film, with a focus on both personality and movement. Unfortunately, senior officials seem to have decided that this procedure was required and take the cheap (mentally critical) way. <br /> <br /> Although I can not give this movie a positive rating, it is simply worth watching for amazing cinematic work. But that's it.
