I wanted to like this film, yes it is movable, blah blah blah ribov but i love these films. If this is good, it has all the ingredients of being a good film, not great, but good ... Unfortunately, these components have stopped! The behavior was terrible, and this was first seen when the prisoner was presented with the prisoner one by one (the collisions of the collars), the statements and observations are not shocking, yes I know, bad writing .... but more than that, writing was bad besides bad representation . Two of the prisoners had a relationship with each other and did not even admit it in the film ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, so I wonder why it bothered me to review this film at all. <br /> <br /> I'll end up with PLOT HOLES and PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! disappointing!
