<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "spoof" of the bad monster movies that end up being worse than the movies that spoil them. Tells the story (very meager) about tomatoes that revolve against those who treat them badly. Basically, they turn and destroy (yes, they destroy) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are not the names of those who have not made the films yet, so there would be no point in naming them. There is a man hired by the government to try to stop the tomato threat. Accompanied by a black man who is master of disguise and a girl and a man diving. In any case, there is another woman spying on the first man who works for the government. If this does not make sense to you, you understand. This film has never been good in the first place, but lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. The film is full of horror, but although it is the whole point, it really hurts what could be an entertainment film (reasonable). At some point, giant "slides" of wax "slip" on an unmarked wooden board with wheels on it! Maybe I had recommended the film if it would have an enjoyable camp value, but even this lacks this terrible film. 10/02
