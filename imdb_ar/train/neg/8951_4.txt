I am a fan of this book and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer since he studied animals at the GCSE farm. I bought a DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is a highly appreciated actor, so when I heard he played the role of O'Brien I was rocking. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on the DVD first, some concerns began to emerge, especially with regard to the horribly "objective song", where I heard Euromix shout "1984!" Over and over again on a seemingly bad electronic rhythm. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally very good, Burton and Hort play their part well and the tension in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the dreaded Room 101 scene. But this is where the film fails. The film spends a lot of time focusing on the love relationship between Winston and Julia, which is frankly not what Orwell writes. He was writing about a horrific future, about how Ingusok built the man's beliefs and then smashed them all in his name, which forced the love of the older brother. The film transcends what is the most important part of the book, and Winston recognizes his position in life and the world, re-teaching him through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> Comment on IMDb currently states that the movie adheres to the book is completely incorrect. Julia does not exist when Winston visits Evryne, she does not commit herself to the Goldstein brothers and recognizes her crimes. There is no clear indication of the initial cases in which Winston finds the article with Unpersons, but is mentioned near the end. If you have not read the book, it is quite confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario, which can not save some excellent acting. Michael Radford seems to have completely erred from the point Orwell was trying to make, and the e-course is frankly shocking.
