- = contains the spoiler of both original versions and movies = - <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Notre Dame de Paris music, I also read a book this summer and watched the film today, initially I was optimistic to watch a good film, especially when I saw 6.3 points from IMDb. The first scenes were good, but I actually waited, and the theaters stand out directly from a book, but it was normal, but when Izmiralda Granger accepted that there was something wrong .. kiss in the book, even in music .. <br /> <br /> There were A big gap in the reason why Esmeralda was arbitrated by the magician, in the book he learned the goat how to answer the hour numbers or write the word "phoebus" .. wait there were phoebus were not there? In this film, some of the soldiers were more undesirable, making the creators love Quasimodo to appear until they canceled the love of Frollo .. But Notre Dame was a frollo. His thoughts are struggles between the love of God and the love of man in the film, we can not find anything like all we have, is some bad guys who really bad and kill people who collide with his ideas .. not to mention the phoebe, not to mention the love of frollo, not to mention jehan (brother frollo) Not to mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's fine, the story will be cut a lot) so they did not tell the real story. (Another note: frollo was not opus dei or some member of the sect really cared about the chemistry he was trying to make gold .. was stuck In science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally do not watch this movie, it is a kind of directors issue to a real masterpiece, if you s This movie is worse than the movie Notre Dame II of the animated film, I spend time with the watch of Notre Dame de Paris musical .. Enough said he did not read the book, God bless you .. You should read for booking immediately .. <br /> <br /> ..
