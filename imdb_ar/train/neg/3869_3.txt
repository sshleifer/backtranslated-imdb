This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These comments come from a person who finds Ken and Ambersons amazing and interesting films. But the rest of Wales' career, unfortunately, is wasted on something that does not deserve his talent and is too humiliating to resist his filmmaking. When Boutuel is made like Shanghai, the lack of anything essential to the suspension of his cinematic talent is sad. I could not tell you what he was exploring here. Everything is like Irish Irishman Willy Will. Which requires a lot of effort, but adds zero to the film. Many of these Wales projects have become sophisticated and fascinating. Mr. Arkadin (Choose a copy, any version) is a similarly likable project. The material is illogical. She can not bear all the weight of this noodle. For a director who trades in reality-based drama (as here), he never feels any attraction to connect his own set of perceptions to reality; or to a coherent story. The murder-for-hire plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Although Kudos to Wales, because she cut her hair, got this performance. The camera loves it. It is the elegance, the most elegant, the most exquisite and the most beautiful. But her treachery comes too late in the film, it sounds like a desperate decision, was made so that the film has some species that fit. The movie can not be saved through a noir agreement that was published in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done in L.F.S. , The whole consignment for what? To convince you that you saw something thoughtful? To give Wales more to do? To make you roll your eyes? Wales has no sensitivity to the size of the story, or to tell the story directly. One wonders what Shanghai should say to anyone who is not a paralyzed billionaire, arranges a murder plan for a four-wheeler, or a fan in love with meaningless film concepts or substance. <br /> <br /> A shovel, a slut, is not encouraging
