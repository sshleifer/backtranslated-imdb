If you have read the original novel, as you did, it is likely that you hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The movie version of the book "Beginners _Absolute Beginners" is a collection of nightmares dating back to the eighties of the last century trying to create a "period" in the late fifties of the last century and failed to re-establish or even honored for that period - atrocities The United States for dirty dance - similar to 1963, but the film proved financially successful despite having to write amateur just as much. In addition to suffering from "looking back to the 1980s," the characters were changed, rearranged and so insignificant that the only characteristics they share with the characteristics of the novel are the lowest superficial appearances, and of course the names: Suze turns from his ex-girlfriend, Is planning to marry an old queen who is coming for the money (when she is accepted in the first few pages) to a miserable and naive "Eve model" seduced by fame, charm, exploitation and deception in one way or another in a false marriage by her boss. Surprisingly, Van Dyke's hairstyle . She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (after the author, Colin Mackenzie) of the film, also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Big Jill, a lesbian figure who looks like Butch after Fob Like in her mid-20s, who acts as a cadre of young, bubble-popping young women and one of the closest friends of the narrator, They are reduced to a kind of "extra name" with only a few throwing lines, and tons of comedy clothes. <br /> <br /> Fabulous Hoplite, a gay boy and another close friend of the storyteller, has been reduced to meaningless in the film. , The camp, but all were ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad secondary character but in the film, he played his role in optimism and alien spirit despite the miserable neighborhood, and it seems that the mess of his marriage to the mother of narrator has been ignored, for all practical purposes. <br /> <br /> In her interest, music (as it is) is well written, and you have to give credit to the production and writing crews to actually take a line from the book ("... some days they will write musicals about the fifties ... ") As an inspiration for musical writing, but in the world of camp music plays, this is among the weakest to be performed in the group. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, critical schema elements are treated as subsequent ideas. Unlike the Apple_ _The, there is a volatile and uneven flow between musical numbers and operative dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can not really blame "the 1980s" for the fact that it was created in the 1980s. The 1981 _Annie_ version of the film has a remarkable tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and the _Napolean Dynamite_ was able to capture a great look and feel in the 1980s. A low budget in 2003 (although not explicitly defined in the 1980s, those who lived during the decade can not deny that the film "feels like the 80s"). Clearly, it was possible to make something good from this, especially given the symbolic state of the UK narration, but it clearly fails in appearance and also in its handling of source material, which is frankly disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you have not read and you have no intention of reading the novel, you can enjoy an old anecdote dating back to the 1980s, giving a shameful parody of the modern jazz ensemble in Soho London in the late 1950s. I can certainly see what the writing team is trying to write, but they certainly could have done a better job. With the name Boy George as a musical name, mixed-race musicians and charts on the charts in 1986 in the UK, they certainly did not need to write down the characters the way they ended. In fact, I would go further by saying that the book has done what the authors and the film have harshly criticized - ended up having a bunch of adults fleeing crap and treating their target audience like a teen-like two-bit idiots to make a quick buck out of.
