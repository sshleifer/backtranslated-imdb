The problem I find in this title is that I am not sure whether the director is trying to produce a documentary or film. The combination of the two species just does not work and this leaves everything hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is even more so because the director has chosen the most extreme things that are supposed to happen in our daily lives, making him an unconvincing documentary. If it's supposed to be a dramatic or dramatic film, it's very boring and drab. In both cases, what is the moral or message that the director tries to convey to the audience? Who around us are people who treat others badly and are willing to abuse them? That there are so many insane crazy people around us? So if what?
