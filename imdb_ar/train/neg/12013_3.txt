I should have figured out that any film with a lady in the Pultergeist would not be good. It actually starts well, but during the first scene of murder you discover that the movie you are watching is a film in a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching this movie. One girl from the audience was so annoying that I had turned around and strangled her. A bit weird, but far from good.
