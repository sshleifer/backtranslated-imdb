Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just throughout the terrible film sums up this piece of trash. It was hard to sit down. Just awful. Do not waste a penny on this. The cinemas should feel bad about actually putting this film to people. This horror film was not scary, creepy or annoying at least. He was by no means visually attractive. The acting was so terrible by all actors that no attempt to attract you to the film through the dialogue is completely destroyed during moments of the actor / actress who opens her mouth. In addition to the whole story, I do not know why someone filmed this story again. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket do not waste a minute watching this movie. You will feel mute to watch it.
