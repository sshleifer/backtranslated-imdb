A very disappointing film based on the novel by James Mishner. <br /> <br /> What was worse was Marlon Brando's performance. His southern bike was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke and he looked like an old southern lady coming home to find. Brando, who was wonderful in previous films, was turned into a laughing place. Tyrone Power, in the film "Witness for the Prosecution", was supposed to be nominated for Best Actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, deals with the US government's attempt to avoid marriage between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando faced a stone in the film. His transition from anti-relationship relations to a supporter occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His feelings and his talk made it difficult to see how he could adopt such new views. <br /> <br /> The Lord alone knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki have won the Oscars for their performance. Nothing about any performance was impressive either. Omeki's appearance on the screen was short and without any picture of her part. The best performance in this film was performed by Mikko Taka, who was as nice as Brando's love. She showed great passion as an anti-American who found love with Brando's personality. Her face was etched because of the unhappiness she felt for losing her father and brother in World War 11. She realized that her dance was not her way out of this presence in which she lived. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott of the Hebrew mother Yochobel went out in the "Ten Commandments" of the fanatical mother of Brando's love at first. She wasted her performance with one of Ricardo Montalban. Patricia Owens, like Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
