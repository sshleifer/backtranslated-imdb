At first, three words: Read the book! Really guys - this shows the difficulties of real delivery of inner things. I loved the book and felt very disappointed by the film. It was ridiculous, with half-hearted explanation and bad story. Novel - in the first place! - Was not meant to focus on adventure! This is just the ocean. In the film, the focus is reflected so the letter has taken back seats! In addition, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and to clarify the events in the end were very simple. ... I will never see it again!
