An innocent man (Steve Gothenburg) has a one-night stand with the wife of the boss (Isabel Hubert). She spotted a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked abroad, but she could not call the police because she would blow up her marriage to the president of Gothenburg (Paul Shennar). So Gutenberg, the honest citizen he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby just half an hour later, claims that he witnessed the first attack, just to convey the information given by Hubert. Well - never witness false testimony against your neighbor, they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police arrest a murderer is quickly turning. When the first close victim meets, McGovern, she immediately flirts with what happened, but agrees to remain silent for the time being. But then Gutenberg finds himself in court. He is supposed to identify Greenquest and, through questioning, finds out that he is close to sight and can not identify things remotely, let alone face. (This is not important because, after all, he did not see crawling in the first place.) The plot becomes a practical maze. Gutenberg concludes the main suspect when Hubert is also killed. <br /> <br /> He barely survives arrest and is dealing with sympathetic McGovern. Gothenburg and McGovern hatch a plan to kill the killer. She will serve as a bait. They will follow the blatant incursion into one of the supernatural pursuers and McGuffer Caldoxisie, who is attracted by the murderer, will only try to get him to try to kill her. But everything will be fine, you see, because not only will Gutenberg watch her closely, and he will not only alert the police a few minutes after she enters the dive, but she will keep her capabilities handy - just in case. <br /> <br /> I ask, the alarm viewer, is this scenario unfolding as planned? Elizabeth McGovern features an interesting skeleton. It looks like every mouth is small and small at times, but vibrant. Steve Gothenburg has hair on Brown, and that's about it. Otherwise he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabel Hubert can act, it is not clear in this film. The killer has been formed and prepared to the extent that he looks like wearing a distortion mask in the Twilight Zone ring around greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> The director, Curtis Hanson, has not yet made his "Los Angeles Secret"? That was a good piece of work. Here, everything looks clumsy and flamboyant, down to the small parts. Just before the peak of inevitable violence, a uniformed police officer was presented to delay the McGovern rescue, and the scene was embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a small part of the late shoppers. He is a stylish and always reliable man. Paul Schnar as a hubby has a striking face and seems to be making for the stage and doing a very good job. <br /> <br /> This gentle knuckle attracts McGovern's attention to the killer, playing billiards with two hairheads, shot at a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I lived. The way it was prepared from the inside, obviously this is supposed to be dangerous and dirty diving. In fact, it looks more elegant on the screen than it actually was. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the land of Hitchcock bringing tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
