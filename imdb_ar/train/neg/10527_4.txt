I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP. This one is definitely OOP. A year after finding the exorcist with this film, what was all new was that Blair's career never exploded and did not become a big star. This is one of the reason why many of her films are OOP. They give a good performance in this film. It is a refusal that her parents do not know and has no friends. Played at the age of 15 play a girl of 14, this funny. The film is also known as the scene of rape in the bathroom, where he lifted the broomstick from her virginity. In most editions, they are cut, why, do not know, there is no blood involved, okay, Blair is a shame but there is nothing offered, there is no T & A, so nothing hurts people. But the film is slow, too slow. I'm not usually happy, but I feel sleepy. It's just that this 14-year-old is becoming a rebel against society, but blood is not flowing, and there is nothing. Why this classifies in horror is still a wonder to me. If you love Blair, buy it if you can find it or leave it as it is.
