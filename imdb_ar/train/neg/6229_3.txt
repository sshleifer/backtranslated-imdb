First of all, let's take a few things right here: a) I'm an anime fan - I've always been a reality (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in pre-school). B) I like many B-Movies because they are hilarious. C) I like Godzilla movies - a lot. <br /> <br /> With the move forward, when the movie starts for the first time, it looks like it will be your usual B movie, down to FX crappy, but all of a sudden a boom! Anime comes on! This is the time when the movie goes to WWWAAAAAYYYYYY on the slope. <br /> <br /> The animation is very bad and cheap, and even worse than I remember from speed racing, because of the crises! In fact, it's very cheap, one of the few scenes of the film that I remember "clearly" is when a handful of children run out of school ... the same kids over and over again! Forex is also awesome; dinosaurs look worse than Gdzilla. In addition, the transition to live-to-animation work was not organized, the dialogue and sounds (especially the English I saw) were awful and I asked my dad to take the tape out of the DVD / VHS player; the only thing that survived was breaking jokes and comments Such as Robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (I chose season). Frankly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and continue it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I plan to show that to another fellow otaku pal of mari at Halloween for B-night movies. Since it is very stupid and painful to watch him and his joy unintentionally at the same time, I give this movie 3/10, an improvement of 0.5 / 10 that I would originally give. <br /> <br /> (According to my score scale: 3/10 means pretty much both boring and bad, it's fun like counting to three unless you find a way to enjoy it, it'll be fun like 15).
