All components of the movie cult low bb film. Naked girls (and naked women), kik fu kirku cooks, slave traders, nasty Germans with mustaches, Cameron Mitchell, and a zombie drowned with a sword. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Camille Keaton's breasts, the most famous of which happens in the classic I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention jewelers Shepard, who play a whore in the last film The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and movement with knives, swords and martial arts among naked dancers in a bar, a whore, and on a boat of military artists heading to a zombie island where violent martial artists die or something like that. <br /> <br /> Bottoms and bottoms easily explode and travelers are often lubricated well thanks to the owner of the boat. <br /> <br /> Then they hit a disaster where their boat was destroyed and landed on the zombie island where the diamond monks sacrificed the young girls to the dead fighting crafts to bring life back to them. <br /> <br /> Just when you think it contains everything, there are predatory fishes in the water. Yum Yum a big fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Just something for the next zombie festival.
