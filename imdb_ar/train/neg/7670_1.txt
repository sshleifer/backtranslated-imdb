Well, where do I start my story ?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends who did not know more than the actors who were in it, and it was supposed to be a horror film. <br /> <br /> Well, I discovered within the first 20 minutes, what a lousy decision you've come out of to see this movie. The plot was nonsense, and so was the script. The lines were so awesome that people in the audience laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have been more beautiful. Even some scenes seemed to have to be much faster ... as if they continued for no particular reason. Editing is very bad. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a waste of time and money. Boo.
