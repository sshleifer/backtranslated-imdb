A big country singer called Big T - seriously, and so they call it - risks her career and life by falling in love with a haggard drunk (Bossi) who wants to become her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is addicted to alcohol, and has a violent temperament. You can imagine where it leads. In the meantime, there is a lot of music, with Barton, with her flexible vocal talent, releasing a song after a song (at least half a dozen of them from Texas). Stay away from this mess and check it out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
