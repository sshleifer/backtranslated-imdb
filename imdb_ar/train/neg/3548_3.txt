For those who love depressing films with dizzying characters and a harsh story, this movie suits you! From the bleak atmosphere of New York City, which appears as a very dark and desperate place, to two main characters that are devoid of much sense of morality, this film is a real concession. <br /> <br /> The reason why she was awarded the Oscars was because of the big shock at the time that Hollywood, the brand new freedom to show anything you want while giving up all the rules of ethics, wanted to celebrate this fact. The filmmakers at the time were like an immature 6-year-old with an unlimited expense at the local candy store. So, Hollywood has given theater viewers (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, nudity, homelessness and other wonderful sights and sounds that only the twisted brain thinks is gravity .... and then give it action. <br /> <br /> It was hoped, I'm sure, that shocked the masses. Well, I have succeeded at this level. The audience was surprised by what they said and heard. The Academy, which prided itself on being able to show dirt and make money at the same time, could not honor this piece of gilded garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, when I was very young, I also found this movie great. However, seeing him back in the 1990s left a bad taste in my mouth that I never saw to see him again. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, but what about it? Good acting in many films. No one ever said Dustin Hoffman and John Voight could not act. Hoffman was especially good in his younger days playing the role of displaced people. He has been like Johnny Depp in his time, playing men like Ratsu Rizzo in this film, and then became a Rain Man later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is a character you want to forget, but the story is very strong. <br /> <br /> This film is not an "art" and does not deserve many awards; the circumstance has been pushed forever in 1969 and that is why it is remembered fondly in the hearts of people and critics. They are two hours of profanity, cheap religious imagery, glorification of strange Oscar (even Andy Warhol gets this act - no surprise), and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song, "Everybody's Talking" helped make Harry Nelson famous, but even that was false because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nelson did it .... and little Few people have heard of Neil (which they have lost), and as we have mentioned - the name "Ratsu Rizo" is still something with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I am afraid: Hollywood had fallen into the toilet and had been in the sewer ever since.
