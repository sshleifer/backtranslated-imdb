It's funny, when you stop and think about it: scary movie lovers tend to have deep and firm affection for those who fear daylight from them. May we give Masas Texas Chinsao nightmares, but who among us (the faithful) did not feel a very real game of love for Gunnar Hansen in the Wild March or Ken Kin, forever and ever the resolute hero of the original Dawn Dawn Dawn? His hijab in a new edition made me want to stand up and rejoice (as did the veil of Tom Savigny); I am joking you are not. And Brian Haloran and ... well, you'll get my drift (if not, just stand in the direction of the wind ...). These are some heroes of horror. To see so many of them together in one film is almost unheard (at least to this degree, to my knowledge). If the writer (the book) just arrived at this huge task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as it is not another effort other than good-hearted (eg, BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
