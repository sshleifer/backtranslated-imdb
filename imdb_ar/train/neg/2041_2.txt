Well, I'll start with good points. The film was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad and fun. Now for low points. The first warning signal came with an actual "warning" on the film. When the next "warning" show began: "The film you are about to see is graphic and disturbing, because the common belief is that murder is not fun, beautiful or romantic." I must save myself 86 minutes and then shut him up. The first film was "I'm in the glue factory". There was someone talking on his phone and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why so the film is based on the fact that some children are obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and begin to imitate it. The film's budget was at least $ 50 and they should have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The worst representation was me reading directly from the script. This is what they seem to have been doing. The script was terrible, and the big "twisting" was that this person who wrote the biography of the Keller Zodiac was actually the Keller Zodiac. Of course they tried to show it skillfully but they made it quite clear during the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details about the plot, here are some highlights of the film. They try to make Zodiac Killer look like himself with "one army" because the soldiers are just killers. They then tried to make an attempt "for satanic worship" by showing some men wearing black hoods at a meeting. The great computer piracy was able to get this child's address when someone gave him the child's name and phone number. For some reason, he had to penetrate the FBI to get someone's address. I'm not sure why I did not search the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random signal to 9/11 for no reason. I've also learned that no matter where you go, the blood will come out of your mouth in seconds. <br /> <br /> So, if you really like bad, substandard texts, bad deeds for the camera and a clear plot, you'll love the killer Zodiac!
