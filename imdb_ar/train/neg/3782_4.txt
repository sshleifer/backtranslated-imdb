Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most impressive animated film in the current home theater version. Artworks and influences are revolutionary, and we recommend that you give this film a look by virtue of visualization alone. <br /> <br /> Now for bad news. I mean really when I say that animation is the only thing that this film is going to do. You may recall that Spirit was severely defeated by Lilo and Stitch last summer. The first person who argues that the reason for this is that Disney is more established and has better ads is that you write me a four-page article entitled "Why Lilo and Stitch Did not Strain". <br /> <br /> For all the amazing new animation technology shown in Spirit, the story is almost dazzling. There is a lesson here, (needless to say) that applies not only to animated films. You can have the most spectacular visual effects ever to tarnish human eyes, but if your story is boring, and most importantly, we do not care about your characters, it's a bad film industry. So easy. Animation is still blowing the mind. I can not wait to see what someone is doing with more imagination.
