All about this movie was terrible. To start this film, he had a very good representation and I find it impossible to make such a great actor in the biggest disaster on this kind of gangster movies at all. The sound track was like a very bad comedy. He had this music through the entire film and began to fret. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
