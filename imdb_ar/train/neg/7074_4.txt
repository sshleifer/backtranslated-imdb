Oh my God this movie is awfully dull. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I hired this movie I was expecting a romantic drama, and some wonderful performance from Gershon. Gershon is fantastic as always, but she is not represented on this role, she is very good for the serpedesiga rode. Romance between the characters Gershon and Serbedzija is very convincing. She completely disliked the character of Serpedesiga (one of the organizers of the awards), he is not charming anyway in the film. How Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my understanding. Sean Connery and Robert De Niro or Harrison Ford may have done a better job in this role, but they do not have the European look I think. No way, I was very bored during the film. If you are looking for a good movie for Gina Gershon, check out Bound, her best film yet. If you're looking for a romantic film about a young woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is very expendable, she deserves a better chance of this, wish her to choose better in the future.
