The end of the game started well, and mildly the end was the better. It seemed like things we just do to keep the plot, for example, the reporter who was initially a very curious and clever person, and halfway done something really stupid and totally inappropriate, we did not give any reason for this apart from, the next scene would not have Meaning without it. It was possible to tell the whole story in about 30 minutes, and it could have been a medium-sized political drama. The wonderful Cuba Goding Jr. is very impressive but James Woods does an impressive job. <br /> <br /> Finally the game was frankly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and that's something to say, I've seen Gigi.
