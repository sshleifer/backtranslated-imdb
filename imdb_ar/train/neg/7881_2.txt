This film is a picture of the semi-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit an boarding school because of his poor grades in mathematics. He did not achieve the best experiences in life before, and got serious problems in self-esteem. After a harsh start at his new school, he begins to make friends, falls in love with a girl and does some things in the American teen Pieish. <br /> <br /> Along with some comedic elements, the film is presented in a very serious way, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this storyline already, save your time and see something else. If you do, please pay attention to the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is the total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong then goes pathetic all the time. For me this was not the kind of "magic loser" that you can feel sympathy and laughter with. Instead, he really annoyed me and his behavior, and because of my teenage years that I was not behind, I could hardly stand watching. <br /> <br /> 2) The film is barely trying to be realistic and it seems that the story was from my point of view. The characters experience is not only (except perhaps Janusz). And yes, I know this film is based on a biography written by a 17-year-old man - but with some experiences with German schools and German youth myself, I do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual awakening is really something important to a film with this theme. But I suspect teenage boys are "throwing on the cookie" - everyone must catch a cookie with sperm during mass masturbation in the forest and the loser should eat the sperm-infested cookie afterwards. Although she ridiculed me in a humiliating way, it is not funny not to emphasize the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub-plot about the Benjamin family and his father is betraying his wife - however, I do not know why there and where he put it. I was bored. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated this film because it had Benjamin's character, because without a message, a concept or a scheme, whatever attempts were unsuccessful could be exciting and dangerous. However, I can imagine that some people may find it reasonable and tangible. If you like "the other sister", you might like it too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> Boys aged 17 must not write their autobiography, and if they do, it does not seem to be the best idea to make a movie of it. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
