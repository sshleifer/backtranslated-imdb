Really, I can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a huge zombie fanatic and I think the film can not be that bad. He had zombies in it right? Were you wrong! To be honest with that movie a few moments ago ... I thought it was wonderful when he split his head but that was it. In general, I think it would be more fun to slide a razorblade slide onto my naked plate in a bowl of vinegar then watch this film again. The film would have been better if we could see some of the usual films, but I had to watch the trailer for other films produced by this company to find out. Beware the buyer ... unless you are in masochism.
