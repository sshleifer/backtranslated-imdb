Madison is not so bad - if you like the simple, non-offensive "family-friendly" fare, and most importantly, if you know nothing at all about the unlimited jet race. If, like me, I grew up on this sport and your forefathers had names like Moson, Monsey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., get ready for disappointment. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have commented extensively on the standard nature of the film and its tendency to use all the vulgar clich√©s in the book. I do not need to repeat what they said. What I felt sadly was that I was missing any sense of the real excitement of an unlimited hydro racing in the "Years of Glory" (which many might argue was already in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was great to see the old classic boats that miss the sixth course, although it was clear that the restored copies (hats for volunteers at the Watercourse Museum and racing boats) were being nurtured by the viewer Low speed. But where was the sound? A great part of the excitement in the old Hydros was the roar of the mind of six aircraft engines Allison or Rolls-Merlin, the wound until the RPG never imagined by its designers, hitting the starting line directly in front of you. You did not hear it, I felt it. Real Hydro Amateurs know exactly what I'm talking about. There is nothing of this in Madison. Instead, each race scene is buried under what is supposed to be a "heroic" musical result. <br /> <br /> Then there are close-ups of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpit as if relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, and in some cases taking time to smile wickedly thinking of how best to frustrate the city's poor champion. Or, in one particularly funny scene, he took some time to get to know Jake Lloyd, giving a "rocky" salute from the pier. In fact, some undefeated drivers were wearing shock-proof jackets to minimize the beatings they experienced as boats crossed the rocky water at more than 150 mph. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer aptly said, "Sport deserves better than this." <br /> <br /> Finally, as another user has raised historical anomalies, I will add one: Kingdome and Safeco Field. Did not exist in 1971
