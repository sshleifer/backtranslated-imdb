How they can from Joe Don Becker (like the Bauer's first sequel to Booster) to Bo Svensson (like Bawford Bowser in the second sequel). Why did they do that for. I changed it because the first supplement was Joe Don Baker in the role of Baford Buser and this is one of the things I wanted to see in the second part. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie 7 movies from 10, and I would have given it 1 out of 10 if the story has nothing to do with the life of the Bowers but it did and why this movie was given 3 out of 10. <br /> < > I strongly suggest that anyone planning to watch this cheese I suggest not and watch the first sequel instead.
