This is the best movie made by a Derek couple at all, and if you think this is a recommendation, then you've never seen any of the other movies. There are usual ingredients: they are handled quite badly like their other efforts, we can watch Bo disrobing or testing in wet T-shirt contests frequently, the story is just an eccentric, the film takes itself very seriously. And then: Orange Outness in Africa? <br /> <br /> But there are some things that are going on. Bo looks wonderful, production values ​​(collections, fashion, etc.) are very good, and this greatly enhances the camp value. The strange way is actually very funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails very badly.
