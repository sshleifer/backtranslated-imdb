There are some elements that save this film from being a complete disaster, but it is blocked by bad behavior, conspiracy loopholes, disposal of additional machines, stupid dialog boxes, weak texts, and clich√©s ... <br /> <br /> What we have here is Horror film with a story does not go anywhere for most of the time. It seems that a group of potential heroes, including a black man who gets it first (yes, it seems that Clichy is still alive even in Finland), is having trouble trying to get out of a vaguely empty hospital. There are ghosts screaming (very imaginative), zombie (at some time I thought at least they did not use the zombie, but they came), Finland Glam Rock with devilish make-up, they are blocking their way. There are also some doodles in time transfer, but it adds nothing to the story. The girl with autism seems to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but they have never made it clear about the scenes or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound lesson ideas of life such as: "What will happen ..." or "The light can not live in the dark ..." or the ominous "I need a red crayon pen ... red coloring". So all these characters (including the anxious father and the sweet doctor in the types of distress) end up revolving around them dark floors, devils or by mistake. Sometimes a ghost or group of zombies appears, and if the keyboard painter does not seem to be able to detect a group of six people coming toward him, waving a flashlight and talking, it was just pretense. It is clear that this devil can penetrate the walls without much trouble, but opening the elevator door exceeds its potential. <br /> <br /> In the end, we get a sequential progression "It was all a dream". Or maybe not. Oh, oh boy I wish this movie was made, and this genre makes the time seem like moving faster so it is fully displayed within 10 minutes or so ...
