I must explain why I was given this ... "Piece of Art" 1 star rating out of 10. Simply possible because it is difficult or next to impossible to assess impartially. Maybe he would have been the same if I had submitted it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have been followed. <br /> <br /> I'm not fond of these unfocused films like HOSTEL or so - I think this is terribly disgusting (in all possible contextual terms), but as I discovered after watching this movie - there is a kind called "historical drama" - It was probably 10/10 because it contains a lot of it and Tarantino will be more than happy with it (and make Kill Bill 3 pour more blood on the screen over here to show it is possible). But the thing about this kind of "historical drama" is that it is a subclass of "trash movies" where John Romero is an unusual emperor among the guts, and therefore can not be automatically classified as a virtual movie - because these films were intentionally made and you can not know Whether the bad moment comedies meant to be so or was it simply bad. It's for people who like to enjoy bad acting, bad scenario and anything else bad. And in their role of faith - I am one of them also. There are days when I have a great desire to watch a really bad movie and find some trash here and go - are saved today! But this is definitely my opinion and does not match with anyone else. <br /> <br /> What I want to say is that if you want to watch a terrible movie - the Casanova of Fellini is definitely the option, but listen to my advice and do not evaluate it with virtual means.
