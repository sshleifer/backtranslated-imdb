First of all, let me say that the first 20 minutes are fantastic, the monster looks fantastic and the CGI is implemented reasonably. It is therefore shameful that the rest of the film is disappointing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the opening scene Which we can see that this film is anti-American, usually will not bother me this kind of stereotypes (we Britons get enough Hollywood), but here is not accurate in making Americans dead minds. It goes beyond the point of realism and your leftist asks whether Yank has raped the mother of the directors. <br /> <br /> The sad scene was so bad and the part of the movie that started to land. <br /> <br /> Here, we got to know the Olympic medalist Anti and the "drunk uncle" who enter the memorial and begin to blame the father for the death of his daughters, and then beat him before everyone starts to turn to cry. Realistic interdependence is hardly real in times of crisis! <br /> <br /> The entire margin of the virus is ridiculous. If the Americans know that there is no virus, why waste time, money and resources in the investigation? A US government agent orders an innocent Korean brain drill for nothing, which makes the Americans look evil (or stupid), and this does not help the fact that this man was involved in a comic effect. > The film revolves around hunting the beast. American and Korean special forces were assigned to find the creature even though it was invisible to the film. The only people who hunts the beast, all over Korea, is the main family and some random hobo that finally appears to save the day! Of course, some US / Korean agents are trying to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The sister is only included in the movie so that you can take the dynamic picture at the end. He was a clichehead, you know he will, but it makes it even worse that she eavesdroppers even that part! And my last annoyance, how did this hell last? The monster was swimming under the water for 5 minutes! Why did not the monster eat children in the first place?
