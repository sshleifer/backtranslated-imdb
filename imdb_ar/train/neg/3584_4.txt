Curiously, the eyes and mouth of Rene Russo - not my friend Gorilla - stand out as a focal point in "Buddy", a production of Jim Henson Pictures through Francis Ford Coppola Zoetrope. In one way or another, countless photos of Russo's face have slipped into the post-production stages, literally filling the screen many times in poor monkeys. A real funny story unintentionally borrowed from the memoirs of Gertrude "Trude" Davis Lint about the wealthy doctor's wife who turned her palace into a pet and wildlife palace. The film transcends good intentions ... it is dripping positively with serious sincerity. The film never shines with the charm of the "family movie" it needs, and very long ago both people and animals seem to be clearly programmed (nothing here is real). About ten minutes, the chimpanzee walks around in the Russo kitchen and begins to throw the butcher's knife back and forth (losing the head of Alan Caming in inches); yet, do not raise eyebrows because it's all in a fun day. However, when the madness of the Gorilla gets mad during the thunderstorm, the police are summoned - and Buddy is staring through the window as he passes the living room furniture. Furniture should be less concerned about anyone in this failing failure. But at least we know Rosso was in good hands: whenever Carolyn Thompson needed a good shot, she gave Rennie a snap. I wonder what is the lipstick budget in this picture? ** from ****
