This film revolves around a rape victim writer / writer from New York who decides to stay away from all that hideous and terrible city and move into a dirty little town, wandering around a small town where you find refuge in one vast trailer on the dirt lot in the mid 12th and nowhere. The townspeople suffer from mental illness, yet they invite mad men to her trailer. Annoying is the fact that it has the ability to do exactly the right thing to put itself in serious circumstances after serious circumstances. DB Sweeney was performing at high school at best. He is one of those nice young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the profession was not dignified and mother nature was in place. For the former commentator who said the representation was "very real", I agree very well. In fact he was not acting. The two main people are pathetic and weak and unable to make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this film sucks like no other, and hired him to laugh at him. The real crime scene? Terrible wooden panels in the trailer - enough to make me commit a murder. Finally, she is an artist / writer, so she could not afford the cost of a double trailer and something other than the Chevy Chevrolet light yellow for the feeling of God!
