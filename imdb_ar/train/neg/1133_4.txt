I have seen a romantic comedy and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play way that is accurately entered to match the romantic romantic genre. This is usually good because we deal with some kind of thing, but the challenge is generally to make it original, new and innovative. This movie failed to do so. <br /> <br /> There is no sense who the characters really are, except for Sylvie Morrow (who is the real star of this film, not Isabel Bliss). These cliches are one-dimensional, but they are just simple dolls that serve the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The movie speed can become annoying and lacks rhythm and the adjustment is filled with unnecessary close shots. I would also mention excessive trims in the style that make some scenes free of any natural scenes or rather, making the attempt seem very natural and clear. Of course, besides, you have the appropriate happy music that unfortunately appear often mismatched. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a film makes clear hints and ends up being deceptive. If you expect a good romantic comedy heart, that is not it. Or rather, this is a bad attempt at it. The theater will only be left wondering why the film has been praised when cinema is now over 100 years old and directors from Quebec are better than others. "<br /> <br /> Les Aimants is good, but that's bad if you consider cinema an art and a director.
