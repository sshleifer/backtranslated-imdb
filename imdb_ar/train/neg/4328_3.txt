A film entitled "National Lampoon" in the title is fully guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. May be an institution in the United States but practically unknown in Europe to a larger audience. The European National Holiday of Lambon is unlikely to correct this situation. The dreadful Griswalds are just that - appalling. It's not funny. It is clear that Mr. Chevy Chase thinks it funny, after all, laugh Miss d. Angelo is very much on his jokes, but she gets paid for it and did not have to get Â£ 2.50 for that privilege. The section in England is typical. The same old artists, Edel, Smith, Coltrane, M.S. Lippman looks forward to the same old tired cliche itself, Mr. Chase is lost in the hotel corridor .... yawning, yawning, yawning .. Bending - ham palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated because we have never seen bikes on bicycles bilaterally Other ......... Rosie Red cheeks on the little girl - O Dren, do I need to go? The English are clowns, the evil Frenchmen who hate Janek. The Germans rush and blow, (do not remember war, Clark), and the corrupt Italians. Have you forgotten anything? Every possible "comic" case works to death, Mr. Chase swallows desperate, Miss de Angelo boils nicely, the children awkwardly awkward. The fact that this franchise lasted as long as it should bring comfort to those who promote that you never lose money by minimizing the overall taste.
