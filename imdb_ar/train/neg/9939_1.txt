The ideas of the cinema school can shed all they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this film, but it is: intellectual dribbling. This movie is creatively bankrupt, and some erroneously end it as immersed in the soul. Yes. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Godard was not a stone lover. Very bad, because this could have been great. He captures the birth of this timeless song and instead chooses to cover the music with someone reading from True Detective magazine or some of that nonsense. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of what looks like the librarian of the sixties spraying words on people's cars. Then there is the "interview," which never appears, where the actress was skillfully directed to answer only yes or no to all deep and intellectual questions. There is some dude in the purple suit which is read more of the waste from the book, which lasts only 20 minutes. Black leopards or something in the yard. <br /> <br /> It looks interesting? Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> But for unwashed movie fans who do not care about missed opportunities about missed opportunities of getting full access to the stones that bring the devil's sympathy in the world and prefer to hear some English man read instead while staring at the nudie mag's covers , This movie is the real winner! <br /> <br /> More accurately ... maybe Godard just hits.
