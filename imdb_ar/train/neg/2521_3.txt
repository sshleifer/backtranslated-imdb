There are a number of problems with this film, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much using very little. The basic story is very good, but the money was not there to complete the story. The budget does not really kill this movie. Stewart Gordon (writer / director) has a credit on "Honey, the kids shrunk," which served as a box office. However, this film has some serious cash support from Disney. Frankly, this is a good example of when not making a film. Had he waited a few more years, technology would have made doing a lot of effects cheaper. (Not to mention that he could have found a company with money).
