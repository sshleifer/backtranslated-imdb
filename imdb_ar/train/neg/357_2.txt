JUST CAUSE Sean Connery is a professor of law at Harvard University, and Kate Cabchu (still working?) As his wife (a young age) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (Ed Harris). Of the killer of a fundamentalist series. <br /> <br /> Strange, but the film plays with great mind ** with the audience. First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes over and over in liberal stereotypes: the policemen are all sadists and are framed by this black man with no evidence. The investigator, the witnesses and even the defendant's lawyer (accused of raping and killing a young girl) cooperate because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a law professor at Harvard University who enthusiastically gives speeches on injustice against blacks and the barbaric death penalty. He was contacted by the convicted man's grandfather to defend him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery (yawning) was impeded by the small town officials and the IL Young Boys Club but found that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now under sentence of death, was fabricated. The main evidence was his confession that he had been beaten. <br /> <br /> It was the beating of the black (!) beating that was played up to the Russian roulette game to get the recognition out of it. Connery discovers that another prisoner on death row actually committed the killing. Shortly thereafter, Idris Harris, who is like Hannibal Lecter, an administrative Henspall Lecter, discovered where Harris had found the killing weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets retried and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... the movie ended ..... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair is the psychologist of my mind and that he used "white guilt" to recruit Connery. He fabricated the story with Ed Harris in exchange for Blair's several murders of Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is in a mess again, thanks to the Connery principles of personal anesthetic! The last 30 minutes. Is a strange motion film that has been shown on legal drama, and Connery and Fishburne are fighting serial killer in the alligator house on pillars (yes, I've read it correctly) in Evergreen. <br /> <br /> This was a strange film. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and ineffective. All the policemen are just bullying and tortured like Abu Ghraib, but criminals are psychologically influential and deserve frying. <br /> <br /> Really depressed on every level! The system is completely corrupt, and the types of white guilt that challenge that computer are also seriously degraded. <br /> <br /> Take two down. Conrey was obviously paying a mortgage or something.
