Ostensibly, a film predicting upcoming trends in British folk music, from many faults on the fronts it is laughable. Tommy fast? honeycomb? DOES includes a song by Spencer Davis, two animals, and a direct Beatles movie directed by Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But in general, an embarrassing display of British music around 1964. Oh, Hermans.
