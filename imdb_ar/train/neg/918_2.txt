When George C. played. Scott starred in the film "Patton", I saw him draw tanks with pumps from his grip, shoot German pistols with a pistol, and utter the noble words of both presidents and subordinates. Most of the actions we get from Gregory Peck as "MacArthur," a character of the same war with the greatest troubling achievements, are when he inhales the charts with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow. <br /> <br /> Compared to Peck's performance with Scott may be unfair. However, the fact that "MacArthur" made by the same product and recorded by the composer himself evokes similarities, as well as the fact that both films are open to the generals who address students at West Point. It is clear to me that filmmakers were looking forward to imitating this Oscar-winning film a few years ago. But while Peck is looking at the part more than ever before by Scott, it is often nice in a story that looks like a less dramatic drama than Wikipedia's subsequent MacArthur career. <br /> <br /> "To this day he thinks he was a serious demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived," an opening headline tells us. It is a significant part of the post-Vietnam sophistry about those who led the US military, much of its time, but what we have here is a lack of vision. MacArthur as shown here does not anger or inspire the way he did in life. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Sargent, who continued to lead the famous Turkey "Jaws The Revenge", paints paint with important synonyms of battle and use some clear set (as when China attacks US troops in Korea), while That scenario by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins paint McCarthy who comes across good-naturedly to the point of the slab, slightly caught in his public image, but not less than decent. <br /> <br /> Here you see him stepping out of the landing craft while returning to the Philippines. There he sees it addressing Congress in his speech, "Old soldiers do not die." For a long time, he was sitting in a movie theater in Toyoko, waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we could follow the story while news footage showed details of Japan's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule. The co-actors of Peck, Marg Dusay as his devoted wife ("You are a superior soldier") and Nicholas Coaster as a loyal assistant, shimmering with tears in the direction of their companion but without any interest on their part. <br /> <br /> Even when arguing with others, Beck has never raised his voice and won most of his arguments with loud eloquence. When Admiral Nimitz proposes delaying the restoration of the Philippines, a personal pride and tactical concern for MacArthur, MacArthur commented: "Now, just as I listened to his plan, I thought I saw our flag recede." There is no doubt that the real Nimitz had something to say about it, but the character in the film bowed his head and accepted the modesty of the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The only person in the film who does not oppose MacArthur is Harr S Truman, who Ed Flanders performs well despite his artificial nose that makes him look like Toucan Sam. Truman's release of MacArthur must be an exciting high point, but here it happens in a quiet dinner conversation, where Beck McCarthy plays as nothing less than a gentle martyr. <br /> <br /> I have never sold before. Peck stands at the top pantheon of the screen stars; he admits a large presence but lacks complexity even in many of his well-known roles. But it is unfair to put him down here, because he does not get much help in defining MacArthur as anything other than speech. With the exception of two scenes, one of them attacking the surrender of the Philippines ("He hit Old Glory and ran on the soles!") And the other where he had a small collapse waiting for the American invasion of Incheon, which weakened his communists in the White House, Beck really plays here, The complex personality that inspired the famous "American Caesar". The real McCarthy may be worth such a comparison. What you get here is less important to Shakespear than Shakes the Clown.
