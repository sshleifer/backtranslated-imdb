I had no expectations except to be amused for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a camp, of course some dialogue was not perfect, of course the "special effects" were a bit hokey. This is exactly why I enjoyed this movie very much. It is well suited to this kind of classic horror film in the seventies. <br /> <br /> Talent must start with each other, and this applies to actors and staff, as well as better material to improve your skills. who is this. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another film of these producers and directors.
