We all know that countless unsuccessful men have mocked the Italians in the 1980s and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe this is a bit hasty but a curse if not a "high slaughter" is terribly unusual, even for a flick. To a large extent, this plot involves a child who is subjected to a curvy-like humiliation at high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek revenge on a group of ex-infiltrators who all appear to remember. As you expect, they are being steadily killed by a masked man on April 1 by electrocution, burning, hanging, and beer that have been chemically changed. I have a number of problems with the details of the plot and the settings of this film, but looking at the end, I feel the need to ignore my complaints and say only that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any idea about watching this movie ...
