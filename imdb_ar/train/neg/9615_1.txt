It seems clear from this adjustment that he did not. Not only did he leave the conspiracy, he created it! The things he chose to leave were so absurdly absurd that I was happy because he chose to leave some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was vague, inconsistent and at least volatile. I do not want to say anything energetic about actors, but they can not act! Dickens is tough of course, but that's pathetic! Micawber was not more than Kramer in the middle of the 19th century, and Betsy Trotwood was mildly the best! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful adaptation of 1999 from the BBC. For the screenwriter, I think he read Cliff reviews!
