I must admit when I went to see this film, I did not already have high expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was quite disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson seems to be one of the best players who tends to go out with little crazy girlfriends. There is a slight reference to the girl chasing him, but this is pretty much for this character. I do not mind completely because it may be lagging behind just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> So while in the subway Ryan Wilson (who I really liked before this movie) to convince him to talk to a "hot" girl, Ouma Thurman. This is strange at the very least, as everyone can see clearly that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Ryan Wilson's performance is far from "hot." Usually I'm all his representative, but even he could not save this movie. His character was timid, unrealistic and somewhat disturbing. You can never tell if a book is trying to make it a gay guy in a comedy closet or desperate or not. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> However, someone steals her suitcase as she heads to leave the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior he runs after the thief. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is superheroes or "G-Girl" as they wish to contact her in the film. I'm still puzzled by what G stands for, but we'll leave it to the message boards for discussion. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes that I suppose are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who will fuck like this? They almost threw the bed through the wall because of the "passion" of Uma Thurman. It makes my head painful, but not in the way "I'm thinking hard about understanding this way." <br /> <br /> When Uma insulted Anna Fares and described her as a "whore", I found no discussion. Apart from the fact that they can not choose the movies correctly, they can not act and rely elaborately on the fact that they are blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I would get out of the theater if you did not pay $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should teach her that just moving your head a lot does not mean you are acting. <br /> <br /> Also, it was possible that text and stories could use a lot of work or match and some fluids lighter. In fact I began to feel embarrassed about the actors and their morbid occupations. Overall, if you value your money, respect yourself and do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.
