Jeez, only in the seventies ... Antonio Margherita brings us this strange hybrid of the West Spaghetti and a flick of Kung Fu that develops around the treasure hunt. Spices for this co-production of rubbish include Shaw Brothers and an Italian company for once telling stories, humor, facts outside the wall and some experimentation and subsistence. Additional moments are presented in the camp by Lee Van Cleef Wig's wig, and the leather-covered psychologist, Yansi Hobbit, (Hamer Julian Oggart, who must have succeeded in producing more mysterious European products than he did). - An intelligent dialogue, fun background music and totally funny sound effects that accompany the various small events (especially each hop by Lou Les). <br /> <br /> While this small game is located on Turkish territory and square, it is wonderful to watch Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the attraction of this duo. Do not expect too much, you'll get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What are you?
