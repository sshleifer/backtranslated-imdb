A very familiar comedy story about low-level gentleman Paul (Jason Lee), who woke up in the evening with Becky (Julia Steeles), an attractive blonde he met the night before on the bed. After lying to his fianc√©e Karen (Salma Blair), he had to learn more and more lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have seen a story like this at least once before ... in the movie or on TV. The film is wonderful and highly predictable, with its end you may see a close one mile away. <br /> <br /> At least, the cast casts some attention and keeps it. Lee is in the lead, and Stills has a lot of fun in a lukewarm comedy role that differs from the serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change its function as much as others change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know that this is not well written. There is at least one question that has not been answered: because what exactly is it, Ray (Luclin Monroe), a former brutal friend of Becky, being investigated by IA? <br /> <br /> I did not like Buck (David Kouchner), Paul's husband; he was a very terrible idiot and stirred my nerves so quickly I was asking someone to punch him. <br /> <br /> Add another opponent: a free veil not supported by comedian / actor Larry Miller, and once again played grouch (in this case, somewhat gratifying - his character is a very conservative minister). <br /> <br /> Not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
