This game was played by Sega. Being by Sega I did not expect much, but I also did not expect this junk too. For starters, camera angles work against you in this game. A motorcycle is a way of touring. The motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Whenever you run into something you just stuck it and you do not move. You do not drop a bike or wreck for that matter. The main character does not speak with difficulty although he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are awful. You ride the trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting with the enemy impossible. This game will not be worth leasing.
