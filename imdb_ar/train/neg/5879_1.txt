I wonder how the actors behaved in this film. Annette Benning herself, half and half, was a fake or a natural mother? There was no difference since even if she walked on the ceiling, she would not change the style of the film. Brian Cox behaved really well. I thought he always acted this way, deceptive, unsafe, in a dirty environment where no one cared about cleanliness. For Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this film. Who would pay to see such crap?
