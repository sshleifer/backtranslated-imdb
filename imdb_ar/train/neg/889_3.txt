I never went to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm crazy to visit this town! I visited New York several times and loved the city and its streets. I was expecting to be affected by this film, to feel like I was jumping in an airplane and flying there, but, I'm sorry for the time and money you spent with him. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are a lot of meetings and dysfunctional relationships or people who know each other, and it does not work out well. Perhaps this reflects a feature of the city, where it is said that thousands of people live alone. Can not you find love in New York?
