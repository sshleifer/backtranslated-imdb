This is the main example of low budget, winning what will be a good story. Let's get back Samaire Armstrong (after seeing her work on OC I know she can do better), then look for better text and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were very bad, and most of them were badly generated, it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. The game (Samaire Armstrong) has been changed to a wolf by initially reducing it to a bad character in the GCIF before it begins to change (Final Fantasy humans, as well as making this Pixar laughable). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting story, although the idea of ​​the blood line in wolves is not new. It also entered the balance between evil, (perhaps) not very evil, and the possible end of the human kind if the two matings. The sub-plot of Writers of Wolves, which some other characters performed in a spell-like way for a while, was effective, but it could have been further elaborated on in the past. <br /> <br /> Get better text and direction, and I'll be back.
