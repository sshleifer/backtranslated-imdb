After watching some great things for HBO - Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say I have great expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Geez. The text often appears written by an 8-year-old girl, some parts are filmed just terribly, (the scene that "saves" Bill in it, I mean, come on, she's throwing a string at the guy and go!) Around his neck and strangling him magically! It was so embarrassing if you want my opinion, or just a few moments before that scene, when you discover that the couple went gold with Bill, is ridiculous. After 5 seconds, magic! The three of them disappeared, and without any conflict, noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I mean the idea of ​​the show was interesting, mysterious and interesting and the vampires co-exist with the human in our modern society ... but frankly I do not think they really want to make more than a small soap show, that teenage girl You see all the time but no one else cares ... Unfortunately, the script is badly written, and modest at best, it's shallow and very predictable. Something. <br /> <br /> The actors make really unconvincing presentations, if you want my opinion. They seem to be taking the show very lightly, as if it were some sort of normal family TV program at low prices (maybe that is if you take the family part). The only actor who looked pretty good to me was Stephen Muir in Bill's role, taking into account the very short written responses he had to say "What are you ..." "Can I give you a call sometime ..." , I think he did a good job of highlighting the rather frightening part of the vampire that should be enjoyed by anyone who has a vampire role. Anna Pachin was okay too, but nothing more. But the man who plays the role of her brother although it is terrible. The scene that is being arrested is just a disgrace on modern television. The representation is bad, the construction site looks fake to the bone, and the other two men, "Why is he arrested? Uh ... I do not know ..." It was very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> There is something else I think was completely missed, the way they introduced psychic abilities. They make us hear what people are thinking and talking at the same time and this is a mistake. It often seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people were thinking of a disturbing radio channel, and when you get close to chat, you reach the right frequency level and you have to hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> Finally, sex scenes are not only necessary, and that was disgusting thing from the sex bar. <br /> <br /> Do not get me - I wrote all these comments not because I thought the show was bad, but because I was very disappointed. I was expecting quality stuff. I did not think it would be that way. It certainly is not a good show though. Average at best.
