If this comedy film, I'd give it 10. Hey me, where do I start? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of horror horror movies, but this movie makes Troll 2 look like Freakin 'Saving Private Ryan. It seems as if a group of pornographers decided to produce a horror film, changed their mind on average production, decided to do comedy, then returned to horror, and then decided that they should be stuck with pornography (sensuality in it) . All about this movie is simply awesome: the musical result (someone shoots the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, output, film, acting. There are simply no words to describe this. Oh wait, yes there: Holy $ *%!
