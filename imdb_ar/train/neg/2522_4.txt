What an awful movie! The idea of ​​robots fighting each other is wonderful, but the story of the film is ridiculous, a real human movement funny, acting ineffectively, and the special effects (on which this kind of film should be based) are old. I thought it should be made in about the 1980s and 1980s, and I was amazed to see it since 1990. That's after 5 years of foreigners! Well, many people said it's good to think of a low budget, but I just think "what's the point?". Sounds quite incredible. I do not mind seeing a new edition with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still love the idea of ​​huge robots that beat each other.
