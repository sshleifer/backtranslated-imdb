I love science fiction, am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animation. I thought that a film combining these three would be fun at least. I could not be wrong: the story (or its absence in fact) was not entirely inspired and lacked imagination - while fiction is usually the biggest element of any science fiction story. Dialogue and representation are worse than any average pornographic film. In particular Thomas Krichman gives a new meaning to the term "bad performance". Bad behavior was not a big problem if Bilal did not come out seriously. All the lines look as if they were meant to be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he made a piece of art here. Well, there is no art or hair to be found in this unwanted piece, but only from the buzz! This man must really commit to making comics, because he fails in all possible calculations as a director. Worst of all is the horrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it has already turned this movie watch into a physically painful experience. The drawings look so fake that they make the wolves in "Van Helsing" look like live actors! Because half of the characters are CGI animations, the CGI problem seems to be largely false. If the Egyptian gods are already present, Bilal is a dead man, because they doubtless avenge him for the absurd way he portrayed them in this disastrous, disastrous film.
