This was not fun to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal job (boring!) Just so his son can go to the cinema school, but his son decides he will make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. The documentary filmmaker must direct the camera and shoot it, not manipulate it and comment on it. The bitterness and resentment of the director of his mother's husband is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank seem stupid and pathetic, and instead he happens to be the most human among the three distinguished people. <br /> <br /> Basically, a smear campaign was all dressed in smarter clothes. Really it is. She left me with a deep dislike for the director.
