This is one of the worst adaptations of musical films ever made. The stage version of the Chorus line is wonderful. This movie is missing the mark in almost everything. Even the casting is confusing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is a song Fall. Val's story is that she is a big dancer but 3 in the looks section. Yes, you find a solution, but in the end it is a great dancer. What do brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous for her wonderful looks. A way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is folk dancing. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned over in his grave. Why did not they use his choreography? Really can not be improved.
