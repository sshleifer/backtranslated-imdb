High heels are tough things. They can lift women (or men in cross-dressing) to new heights, put a sharp style on elegance and give a touch of fragile elegance. Instead, foot pain can be risky and will inevitably lead to trekking, falling and eventual tragedy. Tacones lejanos is a more disappointing journey than an elegant skyscraper. <br /> <br /> The drama of Almodóvar's daughter is certainly elegant, but in terms of the plot, it's a boring and boring relationship full of complexity and confusion characters that are not fully or logically involved. After a few moments of comedy, Tacones lejanos is not interesting. The best thing comes first in a terrifyingly wonderful case of unintentional manslaughter by a child. From this brilliant part of the black comedy stuff you're looking for, but then the movie reaches a high level. <br /> <br /> There are strong performances and representative representations, and there is a neat and sophisticated direction you expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not a wonderful piece of Spanish cinema. With the story of the murder, Chubbiz, femininity, the relationship between the mother and her daughter broken and personal alternately and the transvestite judge and police detective this can be a melodramatic force. Instead it's poor. High heels surely stumble.
