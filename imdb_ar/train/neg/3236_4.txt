I recently saw the first film "Guinea Pig" titled "The Devil's Experience", and I must admit disappointment. <br /> <br /> This movie is always included in any of the "worst" movies and maybe I would expect more because of the hype. The truth is I do not appreciate it. <br /> <br /> If I watch him believing that the opening text is correct ("I found this tape ..."), maybe I was a little annoyed by it, and I think it was real. Although not knowing it is not real, I think I've come to it that they have not already. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what was happening to her were not just what it should be. You must be screaming like a riot in pain. The fact that it does not mean that it is obviously not true. I do not want to see it if it is real, but if it is more convincing in its representation, the film will be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> Hence, there are notorious scenes: nothing ever affects me until a scalpel in my hand. The hot oil, the larvae and the interior did not bother me. I'm not saying I'm "tough"; just because I could not comment on my non-ratification, in part because of the girl's inaction. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me say a little but the hammer on my hand made my hand look rubbery. The last scene with the eye was again a little win but nothing more. I did not want to look away and did not feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's because the movie is twenty years old, or maybe I'm glowing. The fact is that I did not find this movie disturbing at all. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a ring as a modern art installation, as a practice of stripping characters, telling stories, etc. Just leaving the torture, it works at some levels. As a disturbing piece of movies though, this did not work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I watched the Guinea Pig movie with my wife, from the movie "It's Just a Movie" and she wondered about everything the noise was about. We have come up with a discussion of why I am watching these films and their causes are many but include the desire to be influenced by a film. She did not think any film could be so compelling as to provoke me to do exactly that. I played with it a fire extinguisher scene from an irreversible location and was already annoyed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I have a point, other than that both of us were more upset than a scene in a scary scene. Movie genre of any film yet which sets for inconvenience.
