This was a really funny film. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the movie was trying to be serious and that's what made this movie so funny. I mean, come on a shark head on a human body. You can get any amusement. Good science fiction post keeps the comedies coming. I never thought films could be delayed anymore. If they continue to do so, they will have to rename the science fiction channel to the comedy comedy channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait 4 for the next film of science fiction. <br /> /> Be prepared with a bowl of popcorn and a beer or bottle of liquor and be prepared to laugh again !!!
