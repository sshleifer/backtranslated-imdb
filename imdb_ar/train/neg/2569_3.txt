Peter Sellers (a representative of my favorite actor) is slightly amused in Turkey in 1970, but the script is lame and so humiliating that even the youth of Goldie Hawn (after winning the Oscars) can not start pulling mud out of the mud. As a haunting pursuit of a skirt in its forties, most sellers embarrass themselves to the ninth grade. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best performance =? Nicky Henson plays a kind of youthful study. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers get a good pay, because I do not see any other reason for such a trip in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, Easy and many others). You can not win them all!
