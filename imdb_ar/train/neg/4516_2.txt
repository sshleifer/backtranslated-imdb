I purchased this DVD set, noticed it unseen, and I hope I do not. The script needed a serious rewrite where it seemed to be completely devoid of any feeling and lack of comparison to the book. The lighting is awful, not very polished, but if so, I can overlook it. The script does not focus adequately on characters ... There is hardly an introduction to the various characters which makes it difficult to distinguish between who is (especially in the aircraft - no idea of ​​who dies when). <br /> <I have long felt that the key to a good film is to make the audience care about characters; if you do not have you do not have anything. There was no focus on personalities at all - you never knew them - who they were, what they loved ... what made them do the things they did. The length of the chain is 5 hours divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did with all this time if they did not specify the details of the characters --- they put a lot of stuffing in them .... I will say at least an hour spent spent watching Take off in their LOL planes (I mean do we really need to see it again and again ??). I had been given this much higher rating if they only improved our knowledge of the characters.
