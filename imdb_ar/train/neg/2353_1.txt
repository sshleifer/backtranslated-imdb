Madhur gave us in the past a strong Chandni Bar film. His next film was 3 of the worst films ever. It seems to tell the story of some high-class people in India. After seeing a scene in which a man forced another man for sexual reasons to put a star in a movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidentally I did. The reason that the film contains scenes of child pornography and sexual harassment. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very annoying things, there is no need to show the children completely nude. One wealthy person likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this film. I was shocked when I knew that this film had achieved great success in parts of India, otherwise the Super Flop movie would be in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK and this kind of thing makes me feel sick and should not be released in the UK.
