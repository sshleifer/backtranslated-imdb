Although I rated this movie as 2 to show a complete lack of effort in trying to create a horror film of high quality, it was 10 on an unintended funny scale. I could not tell what was happening in the film or who was the people but I did not care because I knew that every scene would have something that makes me cry with laughter. Dialogue is minimal throughout the film but I think this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the film very diverse. It does not matter if you sit and watch the movie from start to finish or if you watch it in the rewind you will be mixed with pleasure. I particularly like the scene in which prisoners roam around, beating each other with sticks. I think the doctor refers to this as a treatment. The genius!
