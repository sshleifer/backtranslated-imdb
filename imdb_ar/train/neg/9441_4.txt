This movie was banned in England? why? Tom Savini, George Romero, Dario Argento, Lucio Volsi and others have done worse and have continued to do so since ... <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the essential elements of the 1970s or the horror of the early 1980s. . Beautiful girls (they can not work to save their lives, by the way), a terrible thunderstorm with heavy rain, a sickle, a crazy brother wandering around the family house, and in fact a damn good development in the end. But banned? seriously. When the English Parliament banned the film, the Italians may have laughed at their collective donkeys about how far back they really were. <br /> <br /> There may have been two minutes of the total screen time devoted to violence and quiet (largely subject to). There was nudity but no sex despite the hints of sex, obviously. But nothing is worth the ban. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what can be done if directors have a budget to work with. In its present state, the film is fun, but the lack of image quality and sound goes away from the end result. <br /> <br /> Forbidden ... What a joke ...
