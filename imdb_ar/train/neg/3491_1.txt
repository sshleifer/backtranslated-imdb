Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box did not have to watch this alleged movie. They described "conspiracies that were blindly designed and violence." I have not seen "intrigue". Instead, I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in the supposed Kung Fu movie. I have not seen "violence". At least, I have not seen anything that can make me comment on my non-ratification of what could hurt a man with "undiminished" skin - but here I may reveal a lot of "conspiracy". In addition, as a viewer for many different films (some of which include the occasional kung fu film), I can say that this piece of celluloid is not accessible. Whatever you choose to do, I will always be <br /> <br /> true, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blind to choreography.
