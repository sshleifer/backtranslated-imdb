I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "movie" are the shareholders of the production company, because this is probably the worst film I have seen in the last five years. From the opening shot of the rabbi, laughing indisputably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would be killed to become "level B". My wife and I were in a great mood before the start of this movie, and we were sincerely looking forward to the funny movie Fashar. We knew we did not hire Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most exciting movie at all. However, after 40 minutes of carrying the most part of the uncommon garbage that I have seen in my life, we have closed it rather than wasting other minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If "comedy" is no laughing, horrible acting, a thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Frankly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the sex scene in popcorn. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this picture because I wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke.
