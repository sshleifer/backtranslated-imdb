The film sucked easy and simple. Well, that's basically the girl who is raped, and for revenge, another man gets raped by the rapist. The rapist is perfumed, but the victim girl is partly responsible. I mean, they both get into a mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she does not allow it, so the rapist raped her. The thing is that the rape scene of the girl is very short and does not really show or show anything, but when it comes to rape, the rape scene is very long. There is nothing essential in the story worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
