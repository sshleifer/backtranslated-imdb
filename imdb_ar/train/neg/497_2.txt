This is a really stupid movie. It might be fun with foreigners looking for a nice atmosphere and rural settings, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Some foreigners hear the "World War" broadcast when a small rural radio station runs it on Halloween. They come to earth to kill human beings, but instead of killing, they make people slaves and act with camels. The front cover of the film shows those foreigners riding skates in space ... not what they really do. These are not foreigners, they are idiots stupid cartoonists with high-pitched sounds of disturbing tone. The strangest sound holder also happens when Jack Nicholson is a foreigner wearing his sunglasses always. Unlike foreigners, representation is terrible. It is clear that writing is for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, children will probably appreciate it, perhaps. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 minutes. PG for light language.
