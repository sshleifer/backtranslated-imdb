The Alexandra Agha version of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the brightest places in 2006. It was not just a new version of a classic horror film, but it was also good. So, after almost a year, we are dealing with this new result. While Wes Craven returned as a producer and participant in the script, this movie failed to rise to the level set by the original and new version. A group of military trainees in the desert stop to check out some scientists and find themselves going from a mutant family of the first film (at least those who still add each other). There is a lot of unfairness that can be here. What disturbs me in this film is the complete lack of characterization. It does not give the viewer a curse about what happens to any of these people because we did not get into them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time and this time, nothing. Gore for Gore is useless. There must be a reason for this to be interesting. Nothing happens here interesting. And what is the recent rape scenes in the movies? Here we get one another for no real reason. Hopefully this is a set of hills that will not be visited again.
