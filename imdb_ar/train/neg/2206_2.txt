An island scientist feels deeply distressed about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: Why does not my dead son turn into a hammer shark. Well, who of us do not? It is hard to deal with the fact that the hammer shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul". Also, William Forsyth lacks that McGeever hero kick ass to save Kinda lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot chicks that make you actually look to the screen while the other shark bites to death. In fact I find bad b movies very bad. But for my taste it would have been a much better film if it had been produced for less than $ 1,000,000. Then it might be fun.
