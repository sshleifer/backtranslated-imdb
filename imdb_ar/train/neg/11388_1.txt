This story revolves around the romantic triangle between the nth. An African male prostitute, a French prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and does not seem to fly at all. <br /> <br /> As a film, it is dull, depressing and depressing, filmed either in foggy or overcast. Winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone bathe in dark blue gloss. And yes, I know, that the white balance has stopped. Everyone is pale and dazed and seems to emigrate, shabby and dirty. The bones are stony and absolute in this closeup so that they look ugly and unattractive. Moles, greasy hair. Yok. Bad news in a movie where people spend too much time either naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three return to the original village of Stephanie, where we see a group of Stephanie's childhood as a boy called Pierre, through a collection of memories of the past to subvert the countryside and the designs of a predictable interior. The mother dies. Well ... that's really it. Personal development is kept to a minimum, as with the story. <br /> <br /> I assume that the film's story is not linear (that would explain many non-sequential) but in fact, after paying seven euros, I do not feel forced to build the film myself: this is what the director takes my money for. In order to expect me to participate in the process of telling the story and to put my hands, so to speak, ask a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pile of buzz garbage that was made above all, from the desire to epater les bourgeois. I can see how it was as a festival at the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it did not reach a place.
