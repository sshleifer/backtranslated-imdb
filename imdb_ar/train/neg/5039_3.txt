Rex Reid once said about the film "Julia and Julia" specifically that he looked like he was filmed through pomegranate juice. I remembered that and I snore through Purple Butterfly. This image appears to have been filmed through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it was not useful for the active faces of large parts of the scenes to be literally out of focus or to be placed only under focus after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> Also, everyone looked at the same thing, so it was difficult to distinguish between characters. I call this the "dead poets community" syndrome. <br /> <br /> No one cared about him, no one cared much about him, and the film did not shed any historical light on a very exciting period of time and a host of circumstances. <br /> <br /> Full disappointment.
