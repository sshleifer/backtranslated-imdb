I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline-esque ads, but I thought I would give them a chance. I've seen it, and all I can say is me. This film was so bad. It's rare to hate a film too much. I was reminded of this funny scene in the movie "The Player" in Altman, when the book published their strange ideas for producers. I would like to know which MTV producers who decided to edit the music video for an hour and a half of Brutty (but this time the name of Heathcliff Huth, a rock star, Hendley Hendrix's name) would be a good idea. <br /> <br /> Even if it was not so bad, they did not get all the other aspects of the film too wrong. The trend must be "You're the only one, the frown for me." I laughed loudly during all the "serious" scenes and I was bored throughout the rest period. The camera's work was winding and reminded me over and over again that I was watching a bad movie trying to be animated. My theory is that the voice guy was bored and went to the beach for a beer with his blossoming - all I could hear in half the scenes was the waves. In other scenes, I hope to hear all this. Speaking of the sound, what they did with the song "Sisters of Mercy" is absolutely unforgivable, and again, it can not be justified by what they did with my tone. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was one entertainment scene - specifically the moment Johnny Whitworth was wiping the face of Katharine Hegel - and if you could tell me what this scene had to do with the rest of the story you were stronger.
