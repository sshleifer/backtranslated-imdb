DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie lovers. This 80-minute-long mockery of filmmaking is all that observers can ask for - the nonexistent conspiracies and horrible acting (except at least an attractive old lady), ridiculous programming, schlock editing, and the background of the basement style to compromise settings. There are no characters that seem likable or interesting (in particular, the leadership has nothing attractive about it), and the assembled representatives barely do anything to rise above Class F. If that is not enough, what about the lack of a convincing conspiracy For this film any such thing) to make DEATHSTALKER eligible as a main turkey staple? I also felt insulted because the women in this film barely served any purpose other than 1) naked and / or wearing thin clothes; 2) raped 3) sex with the hero. 4) All of the above. In addition, background music is hideous. A strange mess of electronic noise, cheesy coronal bursts, stark orchestras. Anesthetizing the ears and fooling the eye packed with something important to keep attention, DEATHSTALKER might be the best for people looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this Conan Class 100 I want to have for at least one person.
