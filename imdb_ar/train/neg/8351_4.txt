To a large extent even by the standards of Monogram, this puzzle (a new edition of Sphinx) contains a largely undiscovered eccentric plot - you'll see it after about ten minutes. The two leaders have some pretty nice dialogue at first, but John Hamilton is hopelessly bored, as the villain (a wonderful role for Lionel Atwell is the one in charge) and Chart Nate Warren Heimer are very annoying. However, it is worth sitting for five minutes by the incomparable Mantrand Maurenda as Nicodemus the concierge, who gets better defense counsel during his appearance in the courthouse courtroom. You should deliver it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; not many directors, but he always programmed a routine programmer with some children's voices.
