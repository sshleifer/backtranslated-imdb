This film received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it is meant to be. One must understand that this film was not supposed to be taken seriously. It is a camp, like the lines of the Army of Darkness. AoD was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. "The House of the Dead" failed to be "very bad". <br /> <br /> There are inherent qualities in good camp films, most notably fantasy fiction. One needs to believe what happens in a film to see humor when an incredibly wrong attitude occurs. Without limits, the film becomes ridiculous. HotD lacks any certifications. <br /> <br /> Even worse, HotD does not bring anything new to this genre, repeating the same movements of intrigues and personal reactions that many horror movies begin to display. For example, often, horror films fall into the trap where the main characters find love between destruction and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I get into a zombie, I want to make a hot chick. charity? No? After that, you probably will not believe it when the characters start absorbing each other's faces in this movie. <br /> <br /> Beyond the obvious problems of this film, like many other horror films, Uwe Boll was elected to add scenes from the zombie video game, randomly taken whenever a character filmed a coma in the film. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an unbelievable plot already. Moreover, there are frequent and numerous instances of bad behavior, and there seems to be no attempts by the director to direct actors' responses to events ... leaving the film without any characteristics. Avoid...
