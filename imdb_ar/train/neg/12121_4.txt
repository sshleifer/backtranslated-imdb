Good actor Tony Goldwyn is clearly experimenting with his hand in the output. It seems that "Walking on the Moon" has borrowed from other better films. The current story takes place in the late 1960s in a summer resort for working-class Jews not far from Woodstock. Screen manipulation by Pamela Gray does not go this way, so it is puzzling that Mr. Goldwyn decides to treat this film as his first attempt at the direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends some time at the resort. We see them arriving at the little bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes just at the end of the week; he works in what seems to be a small business that repairs televisions, most of them. In a few days, the first man walks into space, so the excitement is clear. <br /> <br /> Kantrowitz left women behind. Perle, the wife of Marty and her mother-in-law Liliane, spends the days of inactivity until the "jersey vendor" arrives. Pearl is browsing and you find much more than just my lips. They get a seller as well. Pearl and Marty do not seem to have sex at all. After two children, Pearl, who looks attractive and lusty, is ready for some extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise of the film, which becomes the soap opera of his little daughter, Alison, decides to play the hook and go to the nearby Woodstock Festival, where her mother is terrified and she makes her mother and she makes the salesman! What is a girl to do? Well, wait for the grand end when all the parties happily meet next to the little son's bed when the tickle comes and the seller comes to apply some home remedies, and the father is called out of town, after knowing Pearl's betrayal with the younger girl. <br /> <br /> poor Dian Lin, I went to make "unfaithful" later, which is the high-end version of this explosive man. Viggo Mortensen is the seller who caters to the needs of his lonely customers who whisper a little in their ears! Levy Schreiber as Marty, the weak husband, has little to do. Anna Pachin plays Alison's rebellious role, and his death is a poor Nasha, who wants to stay in the city to watch serials rather than watching one directly play in her back yard! <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk, or broadcast a DVD in short when you have a fun crowd at home and want to really laugh, or two inspire the movie.
