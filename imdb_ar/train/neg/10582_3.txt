At first I was convinced that this film was dedicated to television and was not worth playing. But after a few minutes of dumb terror, I realized that there was at least a comic value in sensational and physical stunts. It was possible that this film would get the movie "1" if my wife and I did not laugh so hard as we saw in the wonder that the actors could maintain a straight face that was like a less ridiculous spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed a lot. ) With worse representation. We were disappointed because Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after all hugging and five. A few rum and cola will certainly help him get off easily.
