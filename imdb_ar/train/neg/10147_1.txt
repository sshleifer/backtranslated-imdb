I usually do not comment on anything (read the opinions of others) ... but this, that's what I like to comment on ... I was convinced that this movie was seen by worlds like Action and F-117 and other high tech stuff, but only a few minutes ago I changed my mind ... bad representation, bad script and great science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Simply ... Do not bother ... <br /> <br /> There's something else, before Movie, I usually check user comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and try this movie, and now I wonder the value of this film by giving it more than two points ???????????
