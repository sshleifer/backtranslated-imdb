Film fine, with a fine master lady, but the terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the role of husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hisser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. She is the best actor in the group. <br /> <br /> Note * The first comment, made by a colleague who praised praise for the film (according to his IMDB.com account, has written only one review - and guess what the film?) is clearly a plant. Although the film is well shot, it is no longer hidden or wonderful or any of the other descriptions used by the references. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a good movie, but it's a great tease. It provides all kinds of sexual attitudes but does not pass them. Such as Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the "naughty parts" that were edited. <br /> <br /> The film, as a whole, is a little center and the end, a lot of third work, really a big mess. There is a crooked end, of course, since every movie these days finds it necessary to have a crooked end. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
