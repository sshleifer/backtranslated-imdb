It is said that this is a personal film by Peter Bogdunavic. He was based on his life but changed things to suit the personalities of the interrogators. The history of these beautiful models investigators have no problem getting them. Sounds more like the director of Playboy Millionaire than the detective, right? Peter wrote this whole film, showing how far he was not connected to real people. You are supposed to write what you know and have already done so. The audience leaves bored, confused, and jealous, to the issue. This is antiques for people who want to see Dorothy Straten, who was killed immediately after filming. But Patty Hanson, who married Keith Richards in real life, was also a model, like Straten, but she is much better and has a bigger part. In fact, the Straten part seemed forced and added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is too complicated to begin with. All in all, every character in this movie is a person that few people can deal with, unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful models in your calls. For the rest of us, it's an annoying snoring festival. This is what happens when you are away from you. You enjoy your few friends with internal jokes and carry the rest.
