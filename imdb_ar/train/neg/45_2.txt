Since the number of videos I have not seen before is dwindling, this small pile of trash appears on the "Rent" list when I saw it available. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a model or something being kidnapped and taken to the forest to be held for ransom by a group of idiots. Some other idiots are hired to return them and a cash bag is given to be used as a bargaining chip, although if returned with the girl and all the money, it gets a big discount. I brought with him a helicopter and a pilot with him. Wow, this pilot is one of the worst representatives ever! Granted, they are all absolutely terrible and will make you dubbing crying with blood. After being robbed away in the forest, we learned that soon it was a cannibal worship that its god turned towards the earth in a jungle like a King Kong man looking for tribal women who were terrifying and devouring them. Now, this fellow is just a naked man with some of the worst make-up at all, Ping Pong balls for the eyes and this is pretty much the order. The roar and his permissions are a feature I always represent in soundtracks, and I found myself extinguishing many of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, have you forgotten to mention the almost constant nudity? This may be the main reason why this film is banned, although there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her out of courage, but it is not a factor to retrieve fans. Also, go beyond Franco and T's usual A and show close-ups of the female genitalia, unfortunately, also mentioned. So, if you want a "fair" in terms of exploitation, you'll get it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even a bad bad film. It's just a terribly fat trash can only be seen by a Video Nasty fan and even if you make your way through the menu, leave it to the last. If you see it first, you may get the idea that this is the standard for the list, and this is definitely not true.
