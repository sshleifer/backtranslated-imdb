Very bad. very bad. As a colleague looking to make, or at least - inhaling the dining table in a film set, I find it hard to criticize the independents who have already got a movie of any kind. However, this film ... my dear. <br /> <br /> The realization of Frightworld is not looking at anything more than raw exploitation (something honorable in itself) and trying to make it conform to the more common error criteria. To be fair, it is more entertaining than - he says - the red zone in Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, just let me put some notes. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the goal of the movie, should not you be able to see it? <br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three men to vote, make sure that at least one person knows how to turn on the device. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror film, your obsession must be more terrifying than a smurfs doll. It's hard to tell him but I really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are lots of talented video photographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, where you can rent a lot at really cheap prices. Get someone who knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other wonderful programs does not mean that you should do it every two seconds. <br /> <br /> 6) Motivate girls to take off their tops, but next time, get the girls who want to see their take off. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell a story or put a mood. At least in this type of film editing, you should sell big gags. The chainsaw that suddenly appears in the stomach of the characters is not scary, it's dirty. <br /> <br /> Some goodies. Not all was acting badly. Jack was good and I loved Acid once I started fighting. There were some elegant pictures, unfortunately they were thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name worthy of a better film. I love moxie from Frightworld too. Next time, after they have a movie of some kind under their belts, I hope everyone includes ambition to something better than Coleman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
