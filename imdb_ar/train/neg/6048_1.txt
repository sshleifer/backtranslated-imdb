More tedious, if possible, than the original (I hope to say so under IMDb guidelines). At least the French tried to assimilate the European influences and complicate the traditional view of US police investigations, even if this attempt faltered because of Friedkin's duality, America's Americanism and public selectivity. The early (relative) surge in the 1960s (especially with the new ambiguity) allowed a huge impact on European cinema in Hollywood. This gave new strength and complexity to a weary mediator, and at its best (eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, Early Scorcese), a new sabotage of the practice received. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, in its hard-edged style and its anti-scholar personality. TWO is a reaffirmation of American values ​​in Old Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This was reflected in the very tired film controversy between America and France. For example, two French policemen were shot in the 1970s. It was the French, of course, who insisted on the greatness of American films when they were ignored at home, and this, to a certain extent, was a reclamation, a warning against Gaul's assumption. This can be seen in the two-film style. CONNECTION has French gangs invading New York, where the French style has strangled the American excitement - and this leads to the dissolution of the mabahith figure, and the cancellation of the plot - Al Badi fled. <br /> <br /> The Americans returned to France, while imposing the values ​​of American excitement on the original genre - the force of the detective was confirmed and the traditional decision-making was achieved. This is even more tragic in Doyle's relationship with French inspector Bartlemé, who must get rid of his dominant influence before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> It seems that the two follow the original version by undermining its detective hero. From the beginning, the importance of Doyle has shrunk at every turn. Although the connection is over, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign land, and his inability to control language or customs means that he can not control the plot. He even abuses police force signs, makes mistakes in an informer's laboratory, and kills him. <br /> <br /> The power of the detective comes from his authority as a subject of vision and interpretation, but Doyle spends much of the film being watched, controlled, object and body (literally in the scenes after being cast by Charnier) to be displayed and interpreted. In CONNECTION, he instigated the work, pursued the criminals, and forced the plot; here the passive, tied to the bed, locked in a cell, addicted, dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of strong strength is likely to lose its gun, and the film follows the familiar Oedipal pathway. In the heroin sequence, you feel comfortable for an old lady who says she looks like her son. His narcotic condition resembled a return to the uterus, stolen from adult stress. It is more important for a man whose career depends on schedules and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first investigator, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother who unifies his common identity, and kills the father (Charnier) so that he can play his masculine role in society. The theory of psychoanalysis was common among academics in the 1970s (ridiculed by Frenchman Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a film full of literal meaning. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tend to minimize Doyle, the style of the film does not. Fredkin moved away from his hero by refusing sympathy or motivating the character, focusing on conspiracy mechanisms. Here, Doyle is a very traditional Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in a mysterious long shot, it became known and understandable to the viewer through traditional devices - screenshots from point of view, close-ups, connected footage, <br /> <br /> TWO is all about the fall and rise of Bob Doyle. The plot in this case is subordinate to the representation, which is the usual delight of Hackman. Turkey's sights are cold, so, despite its tightening, is not alarming. Allowing us to participate instead of cold observation; this is a much less troublesome experience. The scenes are also filmed with very American malevolent feelings. <br /> <br /> So, while CONNECTION tried to capture the complex excitement of Jean-Pierre Melville's committees, TWO did the opposite. The film "Lesmore" from the film "Melville" for a gangster began the whole film, and strong, and foreign language, and the drawing decomposition in the end. TWO begins with a split personality, partially achieved by language inability, which begins to dominate when the language goes beyond - the final sequences are wordless. <br /> <br /> In the film, language and language are important because they are fixed and undermine the detective, but it regains strength (emerged in the return of its gun, and the prophetic burning of the primitive site of weakness, the block of the tower that Charnier retained), Marseille's position becomes irrelevant Subject matter, and occupies the legendary confrontation that can occur anywhere. Compare the ends of the two films: one recognizes ambiguity and despair, and the other absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
