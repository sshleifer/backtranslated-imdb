This time we get a psychic game maker named Joe Petto, who makes evil living games that kill people. He is pursuing a family with a bad luck just to live in the same house where he and his son, the transformed robot "Pino" (once again, get it?) Live. <br /> <br /> The worst easily (hopefully last) in this semi-series, this series looks and the other like soft porn movies, but without sex or nudity. It's kind of like a low rental hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home movies. It is assumed that in 2000 they began the sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and not completed. We can all but hope to stay that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star of **** <br /> <br />
