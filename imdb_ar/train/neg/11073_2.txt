This is terrible, bad and confusing for the Canadian. We grow good wine. Our book and poets are among the best in the world. The national ballet has been ranked among the top five companies in the world. But we make films full of blood! This is not particularly bad. It is particularly typical and usually bad, filmed in two-bit hotels and parks with a fluffy direction, high school acting and "gee whizz ... lets you see what this button does on the camera?" Photography. If Michael Moriarty is too intent on impersonating Jack Nicholson, can he at least have plagiarized Jack Nicholson? If the film is filmed in Vancouver, it is truly one of the most beautiful cities on Earth and also a center for yachting (part of the "conspiracy"). Why do we allow in the name of God this compound of inherent Canadian inferiority to disguise Seattle ??? I'm not just crazy about this movie, I'm embarrassed and I feel a bit shy. Australians are turning into some wonderful things. We produce second grade piffle buzz. GAWD !!!!!
