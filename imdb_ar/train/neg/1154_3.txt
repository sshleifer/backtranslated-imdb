Mai (Anne Reid) and Tots (Peter Vaughan) are apparently visiting their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even with the start of the visit, Toots suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving the month of May uncertain, unsure and questioning her life and future. She finds herself attracted to the lover of her daughter Darren (Daniel Craig), whose actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> They were beautifully filmed, but despite the realism and acclaimed praise, The Mother presents a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repulsive characters, and asks the bidder to deal with them. Reed in May, and her skill and commitment as a less than brilliant actress, Reid flaunts the film from a totally disappointing quagmire, but Michele and Maurice allowed Craig, McIntosh and Catherine Bradshaw to create such repulsive characters, making it increasingly difficult to see what happens in May. As it is written, the characters played by McIntosh and Bradshaw are in fact selfish and so short of heart that one begins to wonder what Kureshi was trying to say exactly. According to their guidance, either they are not ready or unable to raise Bobby and Paula over the two dimensions in their egregious selfishness. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Reed's performance, but few of them. Shame crying ...
