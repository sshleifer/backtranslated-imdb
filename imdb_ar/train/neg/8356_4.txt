Peter Fonda is deliberately stimulated as an actor so that the readings of his lachrymose plan cancel any irony or teaser in the dialogue. He was trading in the biting criticism and disinterested feedback with Brooke Shields as if it were a wooden block with retracted hair. Even smaller touches (such as placing a finger on a mustache that does not exist on his gray face) do not reveal a personality as much as the actor is unsure of directing himself, and is an uncertain film director. In the south-west around 1950, a poor gambler (no higher than a little cheat) won an orphaned Lolita in a failed poker game; after acquiring a treasure map that prepares gold in the Grand Canyon, the duo becomes a pirate. Some of the beautiful scenes, and a strange but interesting veil by Henry Fonda as an amazing man, are the only compensations in the tedious comedy drama, where the leaders are left behind by cartoon killers who will not stop at anything until they control that map. Shields is very beautiful, but - although the camera loves her brilliant beauty, she has no presence on the screen (not her little voice any area at all); each time she opens her mouth, one tends to either bounce or duck. * 1/2 of ****
