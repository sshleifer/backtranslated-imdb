This is actually God adapting to Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Gwyneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble the book as much as possible. But acting was awful. Along with Kate Beckinsell, who I think is a real resemblance to Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying hard. Mark Strong was not the "guy" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and insulting, and had no feeling at all, and throughout the entire film, she could not see his love "growing" for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsell, who seemed to be trying to "redefine" her leading role as well as her partner's role. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Harriet Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seems to have no real connection to Mr. Elton, played by Dominique Rouen. So, she did not look as sad as I did in the book. Movie settings are also very poor. Fashion is more. I used to imagine Emma Woodhouse to be wearing more elegant clothes here. The end is also very long. It's good that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending with a movie. And again, I can not see any feeling of happiness in Mr.Knightley's face. In conclusion, I think this adaptation to be loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It looked as if the film was made without any budget at all. Better to see the "lightest" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it was clear that it was designed to be "a popular movie," instead of watching those actors (except Olivia Williams and Kate Beckinsell's best) destroy the entire script.
