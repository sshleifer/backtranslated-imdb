Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learned that Krabi is an alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear and imagines his roommate killed him and tries to steal a magazine from a news platform and lusts after a young man met a train station. He is the hero of this senseless film, which is all dressed (except Krabbe in at least one scene), but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is pulled to nearly two hours before reaching a useless result. Verhoeven has a nice visual appearance, but he resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, public symbolism, and an unexplained gift when he runs out of ideas.
