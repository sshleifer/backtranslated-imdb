When the film started in the first four minutes it looked like a tour of California, I was wondering if I had mixed the tapes. She then breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is spied by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy Wilder is interested in his behavior, so she is hired by a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could dispense with animals, play mechanical roles, or incest aspects. There's one good sexy scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie.
