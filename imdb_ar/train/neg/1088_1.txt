I rarely saw such an unconditional waste of talent. There is nothing approximate about the swamp of a hopeless film. What seems to be some of the interesting passages the film preaches at first looks more than just red threads. Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. are being cast in roles that are nowhere to be found; a breakthrough from the occasional genius produces a film that appears to have been filmed through a camera lens stained with coffee; John Gresham, who has never produced anything of merit, A new depth of incongruity is motivation. The film has a cheap and cheap feel about it - but barely on the level of commentary - it is really part of the aesthetic. Usually, I came to IMDb to write balanced and generally balanced comments. This terrible disaster of a film makes me just want to produce endless hustle and bustle. I will not, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this garbage.
