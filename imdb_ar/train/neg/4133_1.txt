I watched this movie with some friends two months ago, I still laugh today thinking of some absolute stupidity. The first few scenes were just hilarious. I will not spoil anything for those who want to see it, I do not want to spoil laughter. Needless to say all the time I watched this movie, I was trying to know exactly what the purpose of anything the characters are doing in this film. In the end, we were all bored, as the first joy and shock of a movie faded randomly. There is no conspiracy and no impact of decent representation. Characters are well developed like those in the book "Learn to Read" in kindergartens. They even managed to make the lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
