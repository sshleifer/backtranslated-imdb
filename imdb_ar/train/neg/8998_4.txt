Steven Feinberg, who played the role of Proctologist and was a film writer, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, he was finally a year when he told me that he had been a Hollywood writer for years, working mostly on TV boredom. He asked me not to see "seeing the tunnel", but it was too late, I have already seen it! In fact I had seen it years ago, when it was released. At that time I did not think it was a bad film. Yet seen as an adult was my opinion a bit different. Yes it is a little boyish as well dated. Steve admitted that it was not a very good film. However, he was a little proud of the painting "The Proctologist".
