This film is a calculated attempt to critique the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they call it "Sex at a Funeral", they might have achieved better results at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film is between two chairs and can not rise. Characters emerge from an ill-advised dialogue, but never behave in any way remotely recognizable as a human being. An arbitrary and senseless procedure follows another step forward with regard to the plot, and one of the frames of the whole company will be closed soon. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell gets points to represent her small heart, but the superior decorations have been stolen by Imelda Staunton, as in everything, a police detective (they have no condition to rise?). Ms. Staunton seems unable to take the wrong step. You could say the same thing about the writer-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill bothers you as a fake, get away from it. phonus bolognus on a half-chance.
