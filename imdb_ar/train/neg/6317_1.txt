I have no idea what happened in this stupid conspiracy from San Francisco, but obviously they need to get rid of the drugs they are taking and put their analyst on risk funds - now. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a reasonable story, if you consider the sequence of foreign abduction in Brian's Life to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than just a left-handed pipe. If the United States and the Soviet Union renounced nuclear weapons, the result would have removed the only real obstacle that prevented the two from going into war. It was as bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era, "proxy wars" were fought to keep the super powers from direct participation. <br /> <br /> This film makes me think of how realistic when a group of high school children would strike food against nuclear proliferation. As if someone was saying "Mr. President, some kids at Drastic High do not eat!" Ronald Reagan replied, "Oh my God, my best defense policy review!" Right. <br /> <br /> Did you like this movie? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because it could not support the building of huge weapons? Wait, it happened!
