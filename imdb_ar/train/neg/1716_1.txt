Although this was a television production, there is no excuse whatsoever for the results of the final product results. This film has a budget and has a photography section. So if you're going to film a real life story and actually put the "real story" in the title, then you do not have to make some effort to try to capture some realism? First of all, cast this silly film. These actors belong to soapy television during the day, or in the funny Lifetime Channel movies, not in the story of a real gangster. Everything that concerns them, from their appearance to their behavior, is just a scream for the 90-year-old shopping malls that listen to shopping malls. What about the scenario? She describes two words - stupid and humiliating, and again, it sounds more than 90 votes. I do not think the real Clyde Barro says "I'm here". It seems like a group of New Kids on the Block fans have gathered and decided to make a really "flick" of Bonnie and Clyde, you know, would be quite fun. Well, this sticker does not fall within the range of rock and rock. Everything can be wrong in what kind of movies is wrong here, from acting, acting, editing and music. Everything is wrong wrong .... It is outrageous that the parties responsible for this terrible Turkey had the nerve to put the "real story" in the title. It is certainly not the real story, and even worse, it is not remotely entertaining as a stray popcorn that is accepted on its own terms. As I mentioned in my address, it is simply a terrible thing beyond words, at every level imaginable. Trust me in this, or see at your own risk.
