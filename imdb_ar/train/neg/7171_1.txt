It seems that this film is useless. There is no reason for anything to happen in it, as if written by a small child bored half way through the thought, "How can I conclude this?". What was Jared Harris, Christopher and Allen thinking? Did they do that to bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure that there is one that should be quite explicit, but if there is no recording. Jared and his plane go to Ireland after falling on the stairs while criticizing it as they do. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl in it, and meet Christopher Whelken who dug some old woman saved in the peat. Brings her back to life for no reason but she continues the story and shows her gratitude by immediately installing it. From then on everything gets a bit silly. A few hours of my life that I would return!
