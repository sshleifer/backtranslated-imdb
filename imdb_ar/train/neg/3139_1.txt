First of all, as a longtime student in the Titanic disaster and a member of many Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I do not really care about the number of awards and awards I've won, but for me it's still a very bad film. Cameron had the resources to produce a semi-documentary "documentary" about the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a romantic horseman. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen into it, only, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and the public have these days. Who said that all films must have heroine and heroine fall in love? In fact, most of the real events are only romantic, and the Titanic disaster was certainly one. I feel that he needs a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and less technical license. I almost threw in the last sequence where I met the "dead" lovers among the passengers and other crew who were missing in applause. Is this a smart movie? Ask yourself.
