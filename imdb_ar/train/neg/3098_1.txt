How Rick Sloane was allowed to produce five hard-to-believe films of cold fusion. This movie is completely criminal. Before watching this movie, I thought that Manos: Hands of Fate was the worst piece of nonsense I have ever seen, but at least Manos moves very slowly and may fall asleep, thus saving your eyes from the pain you will suffer. The biggest tragedy in this film is that the old man who keeps the Hobgoblins "locked" up to the final scene. The time I spent watching this film was an absolute waste of my life.
