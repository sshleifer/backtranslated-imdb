This is the worst film I have ever seen. Of the plot, though shots, "special effects", acting, have you mentioned the plot? Everything sucked him ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "overwork" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this film was trying to do. It was supposed to be one of those movies that you can not really tell her about what's going on in hell until the end. You sit in an atmosphere of magic, you do not know who died and who is alive and who is killed and why. When you think you've got the right schedule, you discover you're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you open for the next 5 minutes! Something like "unbreakable" or "function" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Livens, the writer of these scraps, yes, Olga? The director, the producer, the screenwriter, the cameraman, the production designer, the artistic director, the fashion designer and also one of the characters are some scenes ... this is a major film, and when it comes to Olga Levens from Levens Productions you can not be wrong: ) <br /> <br /> Well, this may be a shock but "this time" Olga over ended this great time, jumping from one scene to another, from dreams to reality ... but wait! This was a dream after all ... or was it ??? The picture fades and I realized that this did not happen at all, the girl was alone on the ship ... in fact there was no ship ... do not wait! There is the ship again, men! They're alive! Thank God! No, they are calling her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they have died ??? Or maybe you have never been alive to begin with ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand what you just said you might like this movie - otherwise it is part of the boring work and the only reason you have identified through this complete folly is knowing how hell can end from this movie ... <br /> <br /> You do not see this if you estimate the time, 90 minutes of time is wasted in this case ...
