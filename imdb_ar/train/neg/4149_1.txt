Dear I. where do I start? The father is not anywhere near old enough to be the girl's father. He bodies on the camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. The favorite exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and not a few and far apart. The motives are not fully understood and there is no narrative. People rush to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 mph. The world seems to be going on as usual, but it's supposed to be the days of the end. The breasts appear for the breasts. This approach usually provides some salvation, but the rest of the film made me really uninterested in the breast or the future of humanity. There is no dog without cause and thin orange blood turning the stomach. The general and his slogan "Close f ** k!" Is the only recovery feature. For the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done the right thing and killed themselves.
