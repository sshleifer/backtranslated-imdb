The six-hour Italian series "Quo Vadis," a 1985 film by Franco Rossi, is a very curious beast, making an ancient Romanian scientist quite convincing in a realistic way (very few long shots, no big city scenes) For hints of classical literature and history, the story is constantly lost in the background. <br /> <br /> The transition structure (most of the first loop is played via voice over the letters) and the lack of narrative urgency makes a complete six-hour version simultaneously demanding and tolerant, and certainly not often involved, but it has Something happens to that. The most important strengths are the characterization of Petronius (Frederick Forest, dubbed Praise to God, whose voice will almost certainly settle his conversation) as a man who has spent so much time searching for a clever angle to survive on the field that he is unable to experience emotion , And Klaus Maria Brandor, who is unique, faces Nero as a willing actor whose movements and movements are counted on how he gets his "audience". Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes, rewarded with the most impressive and truly impressive exhibition scene where he faces a child as he tries to leave Rome. It is the sort of thing that the show can do with more, but it often seems to flatten every emotional, inspirational or dramatic moment in the direction of an extremely low relentless trend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes an astonishingly unknown hero, mixes with the walls and comes less as a Roman officer than this quiet, nonviolent but quiet man who works in the same office as you do not say much at office parties - You know, the person you think is called Dave or something like that. Budget constraints are very visible once the Lions' time for Christians and Ursus with the bull is so low that it passes over you before the offer suddenly loses interest and ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> It's not a trip I can recommend in particular, I'm afraid, but if you start doing it, it's not possible to be free of small rewards.
