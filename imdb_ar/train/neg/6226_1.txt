I stumbled throughout this film. First of all, the stupid plot has nothing to do with Parson's story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of comedy movies chasing cars. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about this movie accurately. Parsons 'name is used in the title and his body is stolen only as a starting point for a low budget chase film, a stark attempt to grab a few dollars from Parsons' legacy and fan base. Gram's father had died since 1973, and other world characters were fictional, none of this had anything to do with the life of Gram or his death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to see this movie. I wish I had not. It is sad to see something special treated as a disgraceful fodder. I swear I heard a gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you're not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as Gram. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If the alive Gram felt this film, to kill himself. Then again, he may have been afraid if he knew that the film would be produced.
