It was the longest film and record breaking movie, it had 30 actors after JANANI DUSHMAN (2002) I think no one had the courage to do something like that <br /> <br /> The film as the title suggests depends on the Kargil War, But the problem is that there are too many characters and sub-sections of romance and the songs of many characters boring <br /> <br /> So there are a lot of movie freedoms such as killing people with knives, he asked the soldier does it? <br /> <br /> The output by JP Dutta dwindles in front of BORDER Music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the great actors Ajay Devgan stands tall, a very good sword at his side and also his first film with kareena, Abhishek Beloved Manoj Bajpai has his moments wasted Sanju, Suneil is fine Akshaye Khanna does his job well and comfortable Rani is good, Esha unacceptable acceptable rest
