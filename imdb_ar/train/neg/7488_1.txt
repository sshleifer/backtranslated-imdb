Anyone who saw the original 1970 film knows how the director, the screenwriter and the director can put on an excellent comic masterpiece. In the same vein, it's easy to see how the opposite can create another immersive Hollywood. This movie was pathetic! If it had not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have gone out for 15 minutes in this massive waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon will not write another script for this release (he said he could not improve his condition at first), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic failure, he will not be prosecuted for libel! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Denis did a great job at the original, what did the producers think about when they threw it? How can the director and editor take a look at these scenes and think about any of them funny? I do not know, but there is one thing I know, it is not surprising that foreign and independent films have become more and more popular .......
