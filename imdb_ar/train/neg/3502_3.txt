Sarah Silverman is really the "flavor of the month" pictured now. Are they really worth all this hype? Yes and no. It's funny at times, and sometimes funny (having your own standup routine is very interesting, but not always funny). At other times, you feel cheated by the media to over-perform another performer. She is one of those gentle comedians who flock to him in particular, saying they dig her intelligence and wit. But if you ride them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, so they watch her. It reminds me of why so many men went to Margaret Chu and Jan Garvalo, although neither of them was "really" hot now in popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she must be hot when she is 60, so her fans rejoice (especially males). <br /> <br /> For this show, it's very much like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When this does not happen, the boredom is full and very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It's constantly funny, and has some really good spelling in it. Brian Bowen's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in a single episode, and it's fun to see him wearing a T-shirt. But they never go anywhere with them, and in the end they welcome him. Sarah's character in this series is somewhat disturbing, and gay couple (Brian Bushen and some other men) seem to be facing something that is never doing anything in the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including Sarah's real sister, Laura, do not look like her) By. When you hit jokes, they are wonderful. When they do not, they are terrible, I mean really awful. There is also obsession with kerophilia here (also known as the nukes of the ship), which seems to have replaced intelligence and actual intelligence in today's comedy. So you should see this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, go to her. You can look at it and pretend it is yours. For its program, it ranges from zero to absolute zero.
