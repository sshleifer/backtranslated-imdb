I did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait until the end. The plot was meaningless. The acting was terrible! Especially by teenagers. I've played the story a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The reviews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. In a long life period comes a good film, this is not one of them. Unless someone has something else to do, I will avoid it at all costs. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I return them? I would like to scrape my face on a brick wall for two hours and then soak it into peroxide. It could have been more entertaining.
