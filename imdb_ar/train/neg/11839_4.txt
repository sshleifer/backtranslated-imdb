The cat's meow contains a few scenes that boast smart dialogue, some great performances, and a few surprised me. Eddie Eisard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to a superb hair and makeup job by some talented designers); Joan Lumi is convincing in the role of novelist Eleanor Glenn. Christine Dunst won the role of Marion Davis (although it's hard to explain films that never use stuttering in her real life). But these elements do not add up to all successful. It seems that the screenwriter has worked hard on some scenes - the meetings between Davis and Chaplin are very well designed - but not hard on the big picture. There should not be several small figures, and do not act constantly. The basic plot is full of illogical things (for example, why does Thomas Ines think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he does not really want to hear?), And the party scenes are frequent and cumbersome. I would think that a trip on the Hearst yacht was more fun than the movie suggests. Davis is characterized as a standard type of bubble fin, which is not really accurate, and the thoughts of a screenwriter about Chaplin and love are unreasonable. It is strange that Bogdanovich, who seemed very attached to the 1930s in the "Piper Moon", lacks a similar affinity for the 1920s. He insisted that the excellent fashion designer uses black and cream only, giving the concert guests a very artificial look and playing only the most typical songs of that time (eg, "Yes, we do not have bananas"). When Hurst insists on everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It seems as if the actors had received a ten-minute dance lesson before shooting the scene. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can make great films, and I'm sure, but not this time.
