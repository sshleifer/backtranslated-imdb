I will not bring a child under 8 years to see this. With puppies who flock from buildings that flow through dangerous machines and listen to the scary laughter of Crowela to name just a few of the events there is so much thrill for a toddler. <br /> <br /> The direct event is more ominous than the cartoon version and there are some worrying moments, including someone who seems to be a transsexual, with many tense moments that worry and scare me children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the Disney people were thinking, but the story and the acting were not the usual level. Puppies are cute but this movie is choppy at best.
