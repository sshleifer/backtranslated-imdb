At a time when the Constitution and the key US principals have been defeated by a desperate administration to divert attention from their internal problems, where the Geneva Convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are being ignored in an unusual and provocative manner, the illegal act, far beyond the terrorists they face, . However, if you want to watch a movie about it, try the flawed "The SIEGE" by Ed Zwick instead, because NADA is one of the most exciting "political" thrills ever. Like Robert Altman's PRET-A-PORTER, the director took up a subject that seemed completely ignorant, and printed his ignorance in almost every frame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fabio Testi dresses as if he were testing the performance of MAD's "Spy vs. Spy," acting like Michel Duchausoy like KIDS IN THE HALL, , Mariangela Milato, a middle-class wisher of cardboard - acting in every unconvincing plot turns out as if they want to be caught. The corrupt authorities are better off, but they are still dyed in the form of unconvincing blows. <br /> <br /> It is possible to produce a smart film about stupid people (see Elections), but this is a film about stupid people made by people who think they are intellectuals talking to the masses. In fact, there was a rewrite of Testi, Duchaussoy and Melato with Jim Varney, Johnny Knoxville and Shannon Tweed. The result was in fact an increase in the intellectual content of the film, not a reduction. <br /> <br /> He may have gotten rid of his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his launch is incompetent (you will see scenes of fighting row in kindergartens while shooting at kidnapping is more inefficient than abduction itself) and inability to get thrown To perform with at least some approximation of human behavior that is so blatantly distinguishable that it is really embarrassing to watch it (especially here in Duchaussoy: very good in the QUE LA BETE MUERE of Chabrol, it's very bad here in performance it's over again At the top, I came back again). <br /> <br /> Chabrol made some good movies, but you will never guess it from this amateur mess - the newcomer to his work will never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame. Absolute drive, a sad waste of an interesting material. One star out of ten - this is very generous.
