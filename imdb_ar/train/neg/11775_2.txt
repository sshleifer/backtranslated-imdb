Watching "Kroko" I wanted to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this film: Flat Main Characters - There is No Evolution For example, Crocker, the German child metaphorically, remains a pure metaphor without any ability to participate positively despite many opportunities to plot to do so. The actors are not inspired, the plot is not developed. I think the film tried an environmental survey but it did not work: the camera seemed to shake rather than stimulate it. The images were low contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure on purpose but the ingredients did not add a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had certain potential, it could have been a good short story.
