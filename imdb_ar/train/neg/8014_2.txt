"The wild tigers I knew." Will only be shown in large cities. It is one of those films "Artes", and it makes no sense at all, only to the director! I hate these! All those who have changed their pet / art try hard to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT. <br /> <br /> There was no conspiracy, no story, no morality, no chronology, nothing amusing or even touching. For me, a collection of scenes that were grouped together was not related to each other, and all were dedicated to "show" to show how they could get "arts" and "visual." It was an attempt to film another adolescent teenager, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. Then credits roll! I was waiting for it to make sense! I was waiting for the "good part". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which can be called "art house" movies. This will not be among them. You will be very angry at yourself for paying for watching this movie, much less than buying it on a DVD.
