This film will be a great success with those who enjoy blatant, non-tyrannical and candid adventures about sexual exploits and ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like comedy? Such as romance or other human values? Stay away from the skin. It was very bad and I left about half an hour later. I have seen two children infiltrating for about 10 years - extremely harmful - and this is worth the X.
