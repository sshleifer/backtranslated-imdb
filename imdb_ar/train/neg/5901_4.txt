Something was produced to sing at the Grand National Studios where James Kane was working during a dispute with the Warner Brothers. He has made two films for Studio B, neither of which has a high Cagney credential. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest losses to the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney has made a few films that have benefited from his wonderful dancing abilities. The two that come to mind immediately are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two of the lesser films are the story of West Point and do not steal anything small. Kani himself said he was not used to watching anything but his musical songs during retirement. Why did not many of them? <br /> <br /> Well, that was a mistake. The plot "Something to sing around" concerns the amplifier that presses a band that has been discovered and given a movie. There are the usual complications of studio collusion and the press agent Conifing, played by Jane Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract calls for the condition of non-marriage, so Kenny and girl singer Evelyn Dow secretly marry. Then we get the intricacies of a love story studio-driven publicity with the leading screen lady Mona Barry. I think you can determine where this happens. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about "something to sing in" is the lack of Cagney's dance numbers. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Dow had a lovely singing voice and the attraction of a pork sandwich. I got musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the audience around the movies was paying his tickets to watch Kanye Dance. <br /> <br /> Also, in addition to giving him some dance numbers, he will be a nice dance partner. Dance well with Robbie Keller in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at The West Point Story. Were not Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell, or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> No memorable songs were released. Dao's Corset sound as well. She has the voice of Janet Macdonald Soprano who was misplaced with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Kane has returned to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
