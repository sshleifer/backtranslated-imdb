where do I start. The film started well, but after 30 minutes, I learned to watch the clock. The horror at the beginning of the film was good but then the story began. I've gotten stupid and stupid over time. <br /> <br /> The actors performed mediocre in this film, but I got bored. I was very bored by Winnie Jones' continuing film. <br /> <br /> As the film continued, and my words were used to it, it continued, it became more and more. Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, at the end of loads if skeletal monsters appeared, just to eat the dead. Which makes no sense at all. It turned out to be a kind of meat and good food and the good guys eventually die. The end actually made me laugh over how bad it was. Once Finn's role is removed from the leadership role, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, making this movie crepe looks like the best horror film ever made. I gave her one star because the female lead did a good job, but she could not save the wreck of a movie train !!
