If you want to make a movie like this, make sure the threat is real. Do not be patient with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and unbelievable. The worst representation. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who was one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Well, at some point he has to face music and wrestle with madness. I do not care? There are all these long scenes in this spartan office (furniture made of cardboard or masonry). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most events occur in a five-minute sequence. After that, it ended. Do not care.
