I do not know where to start, so I'll start an excerpt from the back of the cover of this movie. "Survivor combines the Vincenzo Natali's Cube tension with Kitamura's Versus." I have not seen Versus, so I can not comment on that, but I think the Cube was a great film I recommend to everyone. In this case, however, someone clearly confused "tension" and "boredom". <br /> <br /> I will go ahead and spoil the entire scheme, because besides being a Swiss coward of one piece of land, it is also rotten cheese, and the film is not worth spending it at any time so if you do not know the plot in advance, it does not matter. If you misunderstood the plot, do not hit me - perhaps because I had to fight to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the US military in Nevada once lost a mysterious object in the Nambi Desert. This seems logical because they are both deserts so they are certainly in the same place. Different continents or not. The monkey penetrated the UFO and acquired something strange that was transferred to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to stay in the desert. whatever. The strange thing is now transferred to anyone "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decided to transfer it from the current host (the daughter of the researcher) to another person. But instead of just choosing someone from the army, full of bloodthirsty people already in the army, they decided that it would be possible to choose an offender instead of the death penalty. Oh, the reason for their choice of this offender of the death penalty is that he was the first person in history to die of non-lethal electric shock which is the standard method of execution, because everyone dies from the placebo effect when exposed to electrolyte. I do not know if they're doing it so they can laugh at the staff room about how everyone dies even though they are not fatal, or if they just want to cut the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it were really lame, and the unnecessary fight urges us to cry for what seems like an hour. Now they remember that they already had a strange man, so the whole movie was so wasteful of time and human life. Then everyone dies. End. <br /> <br /> It was the only moment in the film where I did not want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead, when one of the climbers was hung on the wall by a tube across his chest, hanging around there and walking another man. The man hanging on the wall says "I'm in pain, shot at me." He is seen as a living dude, not like a dude or anything, so he seems really sad and does not want to suffer the man on the wall. So shoot him. <br /> <br /> (Stop typing.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Thank you, Huraira," he said.
