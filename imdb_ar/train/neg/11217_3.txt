So my wife and I just finished despite many threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this film, there was little excitement. The acting was so horrible that we laughed over and over again during some of the worst scenes (eg church lady). The dead sister used abnormal means to communicate with her live twins, although she sent useful information focused on them to try to scare the hell out of them instead, which was very much like a reindeer. Instead, engage the police - and I'm sure the ear plugs that they found contain DNA all around them - instead, I devised a terrible plan to "get" the guy who covers up her sister's death by mistake. I call it a terrifying plan because it finally allows him to kill her too, which fades the film to black. Bad dialogue, bad behavior, bad end.
