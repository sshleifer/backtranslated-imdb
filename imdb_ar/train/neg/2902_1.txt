Spoiler: a handful of passive aggressive people having a family reunion. The text tells them and they do things that people will never do, at least anyone who has an atom of decency. The hero falls on a woman his soulmate sees in a bookshop on a reunion day, unaware that she will appear as his brother's friend in reunion. He tries to undo his brother's claim, but, knowing that our hero is clearly intrigued, harasses him harshly by wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing around the brother in an argument under the pretext that she shows him how to stretch. At one point, she actually spoils and interferes with him. Trying to cover his eyes. His heart is broken. She thinks it is funny, to suddenly decide that she does not want brother and leave reunion. <br /> <br /> The movie really draws. The crowd roared and mumbled his way through long distances. Writing is not smart and unbelievable. We almost went out, but we certainly thought that something would happen that would motivate things, but nooooo. All beautiful reviews must be written by paid payments, to lure poor suckers like me into seeing nonsense like this. Comparison with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Geez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers, and theaters to leave them anything bad that makes them on screen!
