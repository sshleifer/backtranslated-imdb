This movie is more deceitful than ever, where he used an impressive actor like Walken to play in this unwanted piece, making him seem to have had nothing better than playing such a boring role! The fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witches and that you do not see it until the end of the movie is almost at the same time you should sit and watch this boring movie as it gets, or tries to reach the meaning of this point and you have to go through this full path Of the actors and boring actress thinking all the time how another film passed and decided on this one and how you had just omitted your money just makes a whole point of useless sitting time there. Best cartoons for good. Leave it alone, please!
