This is a film about the cruelty of animals. Under the guise of the marathon, we see images of severe animal abuse, including jogging literally to death in a slow motion. The man who did this, purified his soul spiritually from the fire caused by the burial / burning of the horse, who is still dead, was tortured to death. This is one of the most naughty and least-viewed movies ever. Given the proximity of Jack Hackman and James Coburn from the finish line to their dyeing animals, they are supposed to admire their spirit when the race is over. I would like to put producers and directors in the marathon; I'll decide when they're finished, maybe after about 20 minutes of breathing.
