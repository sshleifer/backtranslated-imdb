If you write an evaluation about a movie, it might stay with me ... but generally I expect I forgot that I saw this movie just two weeks from now. So why bother? Because once again I find myself watching a low-rated film that was fun to see. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room while it was running. <br /> <br /> It was not wonderful, at least it was not unbearable ... It was not a comedy of mistakes which always makes me cringe. It was just a sweet fluff ... and if you can not eat it, stay in the locker room. I agree with those who defend this film because it is certain to satisfy its demographic goal, and it will not be a full burden on an adult. <br /> <br /> He offers some good chuckle chuckles here and there, but the side traitor is traitorous. It is certainly absurd and amusing, but at least it does not absorb (as many have said). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive aspects? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to appreciate the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 rating is actually a comprehensive assessment in my book. Giving logical 4 will boost their classification at the time of writing this report. Giving 1 or 10, as most have done so far, makes ranking numbers meaningless. I can not believe how much people feel in one way or another about this forgotten fuzz (or I even bother to write about it). am I missing something? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays a very convincing role. Do not be disappointed by Ariel Kipel's often roles in * ch when her character is disappointed. You may also know Bruce Spence as Leonard, though his role is helpful. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can miss this role if you are an adult. However, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie to her ... Be prepared not to hate her (you may also enjoy her).
