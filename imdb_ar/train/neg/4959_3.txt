Do you remember the wonderful Batman animated show of the nineties? One who praised people? One that people of all ages can appreciate all? Which one showed Batman as a real detective rather than a bat in a bat? Who was the bad guys can relate to? The person who had the bad guys with real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, is not it with Warner Bros.? Hence this Drake. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they even looked at Batman's comedy before? Do you know Batman means to be a detective? Compiling 2 guides does not make you realize! This makes you a little smart monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout of the episode: <br /> <br /> The penguin steals something. 'Open credits'. Batman finds the dead gift from where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds a clear / stupid way out of it. The penguin runs away. The penguin does something clear again. Batman follows. They do Kung Fu (by the way everyone, I mean everyone knows Kung Fu for some reason). Batman punch the penguin. He went out. Go to Arkham. (Note: usually a different evil in each episode) <br /> <br /> Well, you may have noticed, Batman is not a great informant. "Joker left this cotton candy piece on the floor, maybe it was in the old amusement park!" Yes maybe, there was another 6 times. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned this, but everyone knows KUNG-FU! So penguin! What do they think? (Probably because he made the cartoon series Jackie Chan) <br /> <br /> What really bothers you is that the show is just work. No intelligence. nothing. If Batman needs to think, he will use the technology, then do some kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget the bad guys. Finally, what would Batman be without an exhibition of festivals? <br /> <br /> Well, first, I say, you're the originality. I do not think the other media Batman would have imagined a clown and a closed monkey man, a mystery like Emo, and a saga like a minor (a kind of confusion when she thinks, is not her sex life meant to be her main power?) <br /> <br /> But The most foolish thing is that every character is now a two-dimensional, stereotyped illusion. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to dump Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a crazy hungry hungry world obsessed with bats for an unknown reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. without reason. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting must be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy Award? Won the "Heart of the Ice" episode of Batman: The Animated Series? The one who gave Mr. Freeze motives for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in comedy on his original background story (Crazy World)? The person who made him a victim, with the goal? Hell, until Batman & Robin acknowledged that using it as an origin freezes in those P.O. the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr. Freeze from the jewelry thief before his accident, with only richness in his mind, then freezing it and giving him the ability to make things cool. He continues to steal the jewels for no reason, while he says lines like "Enjoy an ice day." <br /> <br /> They may have seen Batman & Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But hey, look at the bright side. This series does not make you feel anything towards the bad guys, that means you are a good person. A good thing for you.
