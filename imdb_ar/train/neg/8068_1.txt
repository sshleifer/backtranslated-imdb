I did not have high expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 in the video store, but the box showed at least a simple promise through the "killer killer" of "More Sex! More Sex!" Can not make a mistake there! Well ... Needless to say, the box is fraud. How in Alvais did not sign actors and actresses of this caliber to film so much? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunken college girl going out of a frat house or another building like this and says some useless crap for her boyfriend (?) as follows a camera on her bad steadicam. Then chased some dude in a transparent plastic mask and grabbed another. They cut off their wrists without any real reason and you can see when they "cut" that someone had painted the pieces in a way that looked like a crayon pen. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same theme of the girl being chased / brutally murdered by two players for another 84 minutes. Add in a single shot tit. This is Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had a problem with this movie if I had not been deceived by the box in the rental click. If I rented a bad film claiming to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! A full front shot in 85 minutes of a clear lupus chick and kidney does not frighten the child nor cut him. If this is Killer Cut, what is Cut Cut? Of course, I doubt that this garbage already put in the theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this film. I can see them making their backs for the first time here because they did not do anything before, but they were all founded before it was released. I do not know if it was filmed before it was fully created and the studio sat on the film until they became pretty big names or not. But what I want to know is .... have they already spent $ 14 million on this film?!
