I had enjoyed this movie a bit more Jason (Herb) Evers was not playing the experience. Many of the early reviewers of The Seven Samurai Toshiro Mifune have been overly overstated. However, as a growing number of critics saw this film, they saw it intentionally. Jason Evers is clearly not Toshiro Mifun, and the most important thing he sees is exactly. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic class B were fairly good actors, minus Evers and the girl. If you watch this movie, you'll notice that Evers screams in almost every line, that is, even smoking and blowing smoke in his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were equal to the training course in movie B such a movie. Too late, there is nothing in my mind that it is fantastically good or bad for this film.
