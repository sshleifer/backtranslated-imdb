What did you see right away? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. The serial killer clown concept is actually a very scary sight. There are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns ... but the presence of a 300-pound nursery rhyme makes a killer clown make fun of it. I'm still wondering how the character that Mark was unable to escape from the clown ... is 300 pounds, and is finally tired. The whole end made me wake up and literally say out loud, "What do I just watch?" Brandon seems to be Dennis's cousin .... They have taken advantage of him near the middle of the film, which means that he fucked his cousin ..... Yes, that's something people want so see * trembling *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found so stupid with joy was the opening scene where the clown stabbed a woman and said, "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he just did? The last thing was stupid. In a second, the main character was the slapstick on the street and called it ac * nt and five minutes later, saying that the violence did not help anything ... Did the screenwriter give the line to the wrong man? None of this film was logical in any case. <br /> <br /> The film was a fairly stupid, low-budget pornography that I got when I bought it (3.99 all) and I did not get any entertainment besides sex scenes. I was surprised that the chubby clown did not join the orgy, and it was fitting to be in the film. I hope the film has some entertainment value like other B movies, but I was wrong. This gray piece of trash is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
