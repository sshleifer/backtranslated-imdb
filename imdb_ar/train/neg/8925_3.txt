I never liked Myra, so I appreciate how I paid a Hollywood envelope at the time. Sure Miss Wilch's costume has become an iconic image, although I have to wonder if many people who know the picture have really seen the film and know what's going on - <br /> <br /> I've seen Myra on the FMC A few years ago he did not think he had reached the best age through the years. There is a section on this subject in the comic books of the history of Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon Cartoon, which gives credit to the development of such large stars in what was then terrible production. However, IMHO, the film is so bitter that it is not so charming, so silly that it does not have a role, too busy trying to shock so that it fails to inform, participate or entertain ---
