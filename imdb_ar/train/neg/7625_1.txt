This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad situation of our cinemas when considered such an undesirable "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I swear to three levels. The first is the theater theater. Here the viewer is stagnant and the power lies in the actor's presentation and more importantly in the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better. The best theater writers know how to create images that can not be shown by the arid stage. <br /> <br /> The second level is the movie. In this medium, a weaker author can be used, but the exhibitor does not sit in one place all the time. With the film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning as well as strong writing. Moreover, the film can deal with eternal elements such as sound and colors in almost surreal ways. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated on paper, then re-imagined by the reader. You can access much more details than you would imagine for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adjustments can go up, but never back down. Recent updates are not better than the basic movie (see 10 cents per 10 in the local bookstore), while the film can not convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be converted into plays and can always be converted into movies. <br /> <br /> As for "Last Picture Show", it fails. It is a film that must be stuck on stage because the director is so stupid that nothing is portrayed correctly. The characters talk about themselves and behave in the same way, they are pure absurd. Add a nasty soundtrack and you have a movie that is not fully accessible. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe people. The coach mocked the melancholy of the film. The sad thing is how this idle work is considered frustrating when the substance itself is fun. If this in the color of sexual impotence scenes, the billiards, the old whore will be a great comedy. Look at what Lucas did with "American Graffiti" a few years later. <br /> <br /> The US secondary education system needs to begin teaching a movie about a film rather than trying to teach a movie with. Two strong goals: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on, not this. It is the "last" I want to see from him. 1 of 5.
