Well, if you're looking for another diary for Bastketball, this is a completely wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Turn around two brothers. Max, younger, has a great addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, doctor. This movie is supposed to show diving from reality to the lowest levels that drugs make possible. However, no. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what happens. Most of the film focuses on Max and his parting ways. In the end, Adam is no longer able to withstand the pressure from his job and starts using it too (narcotics). <br /> <br /> This film does not reach its peak. Do not descend to what cocaine really does to you, and it has boring scenes and a low budget, and the behavior of the older brother, Adam, is horrific. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how to manage this film to win and receive awards, it is not a heart. If you want a clear and true story film on the extreme world of drugs, if not buy "Basketball Diary." Notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy it. Try and see for yourself ...
