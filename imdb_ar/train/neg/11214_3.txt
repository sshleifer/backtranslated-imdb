I also saw this film in a local show about a year ago. First, I will say it looks fantastic. Cassella is an incredibly talented cinematographer. I wish the film was as good as it sounds. I will not call this horror film. Putting a few shots of a degraded specter does not make it a horror film. There is no mystery, there is no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what happens with both sides of the entire film. I think acting was fine, but there is nothing special. <br /> <br /> The logo of the tag, "Revenge can be deadly" .... Really? ... Should they check the number of hundreds of horror / thrill movies containing the same specific logo? <br /> <br /> It's painful to say some of this, but I know a lot of people who worked on this film, and I know they do not want to blow people up smoking their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
