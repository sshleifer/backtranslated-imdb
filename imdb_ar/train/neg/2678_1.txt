Nothing positive to say. Wandering nonsense, bloating and bloating with "message". The new Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), yet many have a bouquet of cardboard and a taste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a "dozor" type of vacuum. The act would be terrible, if not because of the grace of an entirely unattractive direction and inefficient editing that is sometimes so terrible that it distracts attention from the inability of actors. A special prize for the photographer to make sure that each shot is shaken (does anyone realize that the charming Blair has 15 seconds of unfulfilled fame?) And is directed towards the attention deficit adolescents who calmer in CounterStrike and masturbation. The female appears and tries to look attractive. Male children need a meeting coach (although heredity is not bad: the eyes are rather expressive.) One finger (middle) for this inappropriate pile of art. Anyone who reviews this positively is a distant (cousin) cousin of the "authors".
