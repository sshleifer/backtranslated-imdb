Dear Sir. This movie ... was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. Most of the time, horror movies that others say are bad, I love. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was amazing, I will say so. But this plot was terrifying. Does not make sense! She had a lot of unfairness, and a sexy scene was unnecessary (and disgusting) at first. I think the director was trying to be "awful" or otherwise, but he came out awful. To add to the heap of spoiled crap they launched a plot, the actors (along with the "Scarecrow") are awful, and I cared little of them until I soon forgot who was. In conclusion, this movie made me ill. If you can avoid watching this movie in any case, please do.
