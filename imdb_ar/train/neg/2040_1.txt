This is the worst film I have ever seen. I do not exaggerate, I told the guy at the Blockbuster that they should take off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. In the box you say "from the dance director" so I figured ... er, no matter what, if this has been recently, I'm sure guidance at least would not be a bad thing: - but after seeing the movie and looking at what they're talking about "They were talking about it, it's been a bit of nonsense since the early 1980s. A great way to deal with unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think they just loved the name "Zodiac Killer" and did not bother to research any of Zodiac's actual crimes or his own MO, or even the years he was active. All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with Zodiac and the "stories" about the original Zodiac occur after several years of committing actual Zodiac crimes. They also compare zodiac to "Dusseldorf Vampire" Fritz Harman throughout the film and talk with Fritz's "son" a lot. Both Zodiac and Haarman were not alike, and it makes sense to compare it to BTK who also shot people, not the man who killed people by chewing them through their necks. None of the true Harman facts, just a bunch of mixed waffles. So his son says "Do not forget, his name was Fritz Harman with 2 t" ... his only actual name is one! I think the writer / director simply wrote in a Google search for armed killers and the fastest they showed up were the Keller and Fritz Harman. "Who looks like great names, let's make a film about them without doing any external research! <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite contrast in this film is how experts and young people describe the DSM-IV killer and get cured. "I have also been diagnosed on DSM-IV and have since recovered," etc. For those of you who do not know, DSM-IV is a psychological guide to mental disorders. If anyone has the same book, they should face some serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my point is that this happens at the bottom of the worst 5 movies in the time list, and it's rare for the movie to reach that point. But, if you're interested in seeing a completely unrealistic story about serial killers, they are not boring, filled with inexperienced actors, and not quite rational, I say check out this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, I loved how killer "tear" a killer of his victims with dry snow. Beautiful touch ...
