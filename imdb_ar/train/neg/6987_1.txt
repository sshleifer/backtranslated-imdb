I am all for the idea of ​​a major epic of the American Revolutionary War. That's not it. (In this regard, Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson was not the Patriot, but I dig.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a show at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive piece, written by the veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (from the fame of Firewire), and the Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But he did not take a yearning for people to begin to squeeze their seats, whispering sarcastic comments about the terrible wrong-hearted Pachino - he was supposed to be the American frontier out of Scotsman (!) - and Nestia Kinski, who was supposedly To emigrate from England (!!). Then the story started and everything went quickly. <br /> <br /> The motives were confused, the dialogue was terrible, and the events had no historical or political context. There was no conspiracy spread in a silly coincidence. The second or third time in which the two alleged bashino and kinky lovers found themselves in each other became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland performed poorly as a British officer. His accent was all over the map as well. I think there were no representatives of English. <br /> <br /> Many people left. Those who stayed tried to choke laughter, then openly oppressed. I hung out - I thought the battle scenes might at least be good. I was wrong. Incredibly, Hudson chose to shoot them with hand-held cameras, not even Steadicam, those shivers that give the misplaced "health" a sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There were some famous television references in the audience a few rows in front of me: (late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness. I can tell that he was upset by our behavior. Certainly enough, in the television part the next day, he gave the film "10" in his famous book "Franklin Skill from 1 to 10", while noting with a note about the cutters who disrupted the movie the night before, and who did not do so clearly. They knew art when they saw it. What a joker. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino did not attend a role in another film about 4 years ago. Hugh Hudson never recovered. You can not say I did not warn you.
