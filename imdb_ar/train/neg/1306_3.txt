(Also known as DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television although it was filmed in English and was never a complement to previous DEMONS movies. It was supposed to be simply titled The OGRE, which was directed by director Lamberto Bava. <br /> <br /> A US family rents an Italian villa in the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams for herself as a little girl descends to the old wine cellar in this villa, facing this structure resembling a hanging hook from the ceiling. It shines and is covered in spider filaments and contains what resembles spider legs or insects hanging from it. It drips like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe any of this. The villa is old and modern and produces a strange noise in the middle of the night and only has to ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE shows itself in a somewhat similar form of Centauri costume 16 with what resembles the wolf's head attached to it and is attracted to the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> The films are not that bad at least, and the dialogue is at least half-way smart without embarrassing ridiculous phrases brought by dubbing. There is no real gorge other than some rotting skeletons in the basement pool that really look down the modern swimming pool. The OGRE simply vanishes itself after being controlled by the Cherokee pocket of the family. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I saw was flawed, with the picture black for a few seconds in about half an hour of the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has corrected. The additions include a short interview with Lamberto Bava explaining how this was not a sequel, etc ... etc, along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD versions. These are pretty standard things. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
