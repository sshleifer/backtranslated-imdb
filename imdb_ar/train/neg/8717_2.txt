This is one of the most bad movies my joy I had the privilege of seeing at all. <br /> <br /> I watched this on a DVD with a group of friends on Friday night and could not stop laughing from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: the terrorists are hijacking a convoy they believe holds Euranuma used in weapons, but in fact carries a group of dinosaurs eaten by humans. Easy error to make. Cue an incompetent team of special forces to handle the prehistoric monsters. Led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine. A man seems to have mastered the "smell of the wind", as Joy called it in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of shooting and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance seems to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a crowd of giant monsters. Also, it seems that the lights always flicker and emerge whenever the velociraptor is attacked (perhaps even we can not see how bad the creature's effect is). <br /> <br /> After saying all this, we had a lot of fun betting on who was going to hit his head next time. <br /> <br /> As an adventure in the style of Jusassic Park / Aliens, this film spreads worse than the crotch in dinosaurs, but as an ironic and tongue-in-cheek entertainment is a roar success.
