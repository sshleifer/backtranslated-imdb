I have to put an alert all over the place saying the film should not be seen. It is a failure to honor so appropriately that it is almost an insult to the memory of these brave men. Your influence was terrible, I did not expect the total failure of the manager in estimating military technology. How can a spray gun, usually fired at 600 rounds per minute, shoot at 10/1? How can soldiers fall when a bomb explodes in front of them? How can people survive when artillery shells fall 20 feet? How do artillery shells fall on either side of the road and not on the same road? <br /> <br /> It was not only this contempt for weapons that bothered me, it was the vulgar attitudes and the contradictions of the dialogues that I used to cry for. There were standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. It is stupid to say at least. <br /> <br /> What Chopha wrote is true. The director worked without a screenplay and shows. There is no flow on the film. There is no gradual progress from battle to battle. It is a firefight one after the other without any connection to the comprehensive plan of war. The scenes are horrible. The army chief of staff seems unconvinced. To make matters worse, theater people have randomly cut footage to fit the film for four hours in 3 hours.
