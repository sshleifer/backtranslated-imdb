While on vacation on the beach, the brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mommy (like Arthur and Petit Lomis) find a red hair. The boys climbed up their creature "Sammy" and spent the summer joying with the Lion of the Sand Sea. When it comes time to go home, children start to worry about separation. Young Mr. McGreevey decides they can not return "Sammy" to "Disneyland" ?? Er, "Getsville" - but the young man Momi packs him anyway. At home, trying to hide the "seal off" for adults, of course? The kidnappers read out! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Out-Seal seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
