The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the direction that most of this movie takes. Lenny (Ryan Meyerman) is a 14-year-old boy who lives in New York in the 1950s. He has an urgent desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people in his mind? Well, his mother and his wife of course! How nice it is. Unfortunately for Lenny, he was arrested before he sees anything, and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his wife uncle. <br /> <br /> The following Lenny plan is to see his uncle and wife having sex. However, the wife is fully pregnant and she does not sleep currently together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time lounging around girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit down and talk about sex. The problem is ... it was not done in an innocent way from 1950. I am not proud by any means, but I found it disturbing to listen to these children talking about masturbation, sucking and anal sex. This kind of roughness may work in a movie like "Kids" (1995) but this film seems oblique. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely lost here as Hedy, a former model who becomes a strait of Lenny's physical desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay away from the manager's chair as much as possible. "For the best or the worst" (1996) was bad and now this. O wasteful. 10/01
