Billy Wilder's 1973 classic TV version is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, good things. JJ Cobb makes Barton Keys fabulous. It's not as good as Edward J. Robinson, of course, but the only reason to watch it. The only improvement in the new version of the original is that it reduces the role of Lula Dietrichon, the first daughter of Fatal Family, Phyllis Dietrichon. <br /> <br /> That's all for good things. <br /> <br /> The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent way: if you see the movie in a low voice, it is hard to get the impression that something particularly interesting was happening. Because of the bad taste of modern, the film must be a bluna instead of black and white. Because of the 1970s, all groups became remarkably ugly. Apartment Walter Neff is expensive, in particular, appalling. <br /> <br /> The modern environment hurts me in many ways. Trains were even more exotic in the 1970s than in the 1940s, so Mr. Dietrichon's decision to train independence seemed more than just harmony. Men stop wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while pretending to be white-haired Mr. Dietrichon. The women stopped mourning for wearing the niqab, which Samantha stole a rent from one of the defenders Barbara Stanwyck benefited from a superb scene. (It is strange that Lula still has a line where she reveals that her father's wife was trying to wear a black hat and veil before she needed it). <br /> <br /> Steven Boshko has a lot of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler's scenario. But it makes a lot of minor changes that can not be explained to the dialogue, which leaves the text a bit unexplored, as it was weak and organic. It's disgusting to joke that the famous motorcycle cop has finished, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where these lines should have been. Bochco may not be responsible. <br /> <br /> Richard Crane is as acceptable as Walter Neff. What has made this version acceptable is the really wonderful dishrichon filice. Instead, we get Samantha Rent, which leaps like a villain in the standard version of Barnaby Jones. But who can blame Eggar? With the director who seems barely interested in what happens in front of the camera, how did Barbara Stanwyck go well?
