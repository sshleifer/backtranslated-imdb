What a terrible film. Absorb. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this film but DinoCrap, which was stolen from some of his nail reviewers. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sigh ... not Roger Korman I hate, it's a scary film. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Another thing, CGI sucked loudly. I hate this film in a scary way. This is undoubtedly the worst film by Roger Korman, and probably the most B films. It's it --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I have to hurt some morons at this moment. It's just a terrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
