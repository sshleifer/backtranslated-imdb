As a mother of two small children, or should I say, I grew up with many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel like I'm in a good position to comment on the current and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If you are a family we have not seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby get the idea that we enjoyed it as light weight, nothing special on Saturday morning. But the problem in essence is that they are in their current form so lightweight that they will not have the longevity of Scooby and the "old" gang. I am sure it may succeed in achieving a quick cash return, but I am sure that the long-term purchase of seniors and young people is in very real danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son, who saw the new version, was very upset and without any claim, saying that he seemed to be moving badly and why he was not like the last string (where you are). <br /> <br /> Scrappy was an anomaly but it's still better than this. Let's hope you get an idea that will be apropos with reference to the producers.
