I do not think any player in Hollywood history has survived as long as David Neven has presented most of the weak films he was forced to carry because of his amazing charm. He could have acted, won the Academy Award, but most of the material he did was as light as one piece of tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is an example of this. He is a musician and will often remember Vera Elaine. You will remember that they dressed in Scott where the movie is shown in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you remember one of them, you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the leading American musician who appears to be coming out of town in Edinburgh. She begins the chorus and runs late one day. She gets the lift from the millionaire greeting card driver. Everyone now assumes that they are the main pressure of the millionaires. The doors open because they have not opened before. <br /> <br /> Millionaire is David Neven and he accompanies him and the various positions caused by the error. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic product of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, although Happy Go Lovely is a light, harmless fluff, David Neven has done a lot of it and tired of it.
