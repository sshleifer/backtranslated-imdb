Why does Hollywood feel the need to reproduce films that were so wonderful (The Texas Massacre Massacre, The Hills Is Easy), but it is much worse that Hollywood feels the need to reproduce these horror films that were not initially ingenious (Night Concert , The Amityville Horror) Like their original origins, these reconfigurations fail to create an atmosphere, character or any real fears at all. The prom night is very flat and interesting, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a bad-behaved, uninteresting, large-scale, boring journey that eventually fails in everything designed to do. Hollywood is obviously a dead horror. Even the Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have managed to destroy their property in style with buckets of blood and decent plot. Night concert almost non-bloody and will not mention how bad the plot. His inability to identify the killers makes the film one of the least disturbing horror films since its debut ... The Original Movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most famous films of the 1980s is to intimidate filmgoers with this new version that shows just how terrifying secondary school dances can really be. Donna Cable (Brittany Snow) survived a terrible tragedy, but now it's time to let go of the past and celebrate her elegant musical day. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna is the best and her friends are preparing to enjoy the bombing of the last big high school by living there and celebrating until dawn. But while Donna is ready to look beyond her nightmares and a brighter future, the man she thought she had fled for ever returned to a final dance. A maniac killer in a loose position, and slay anyone who tries to prevent him from reaching Donna alone. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do when she is forced to face her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Strobe and Dana Davis have shared a new version that will bring teenagers dressed in a nightgown all over the place looking nervously from their shoulders as they step into the ballroom. A plot that will probably put you on your way to see this. Charming if you ask me something good. <br /> <br /> Without much work, McCormick is cleverly trying to relieve stress from the most common situations. At some point, a girl returns to a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it in a moment of panic. Desperate times really call for desperate measures. There have not been many such snapshots of cabinets since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the Age of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is likely to be a terrible and frightening film that is not being mined by the cheerful irritation and creeping society obsession with youthful beauty. This is not the film. <br /> <br /> My final judgment? Avoid at all costs. No one will like the Night Night concert, but it is disappointing for those who usually enjoy reshaping piracy. Consider its absolute lack of blood or fear. Night will be in a hurry to forget.
