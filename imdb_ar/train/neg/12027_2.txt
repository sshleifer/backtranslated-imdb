I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was tossing through the channels and there was nothing else I could see. It's one of those movies that stop to see what it is - for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you can not turn it off, no matter how damaging it is. One of those movies that fall somewhere between being so bad is that they are very good and bad, well, just a BAD, it's worth to see just for the jamming experience of realizing that they are both! Fantastic fare in the middle of the night, just for a wonderful tennis pull. Do not even bother asking yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is obviously mentioned, because logic does not apply.
