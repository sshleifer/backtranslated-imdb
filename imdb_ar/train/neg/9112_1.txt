Basically, harsh intentions 2 are cruel intentions 1, again, not only poorly. The story is exactly the same as the first story (even some lines), with only a few exceptions. Cast more unknown, certainly less talent. Instead of being seductive and attracted to watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to a soft porn. I'm not sure whether some of the stupid lines should be blamed on actors or writers ... I always feel bad about saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a waste of time for my life. I was literally amazed by some films, and this is no exception ... I can not believe that she will make a third film.
