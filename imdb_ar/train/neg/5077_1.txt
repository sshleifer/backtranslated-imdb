A recently deleted publication from another IMDb user indicated that anyone who might see "Medusa Touch" should be warned of a scene that reminds you of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York City. But I hope anyone reading this will read this warning. The producer co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced the Academy Award-winning Los Angeles Confectionery, screenwriter John Bailey won an Oscar for "Gandhi" (cast) , Found that "Medusa Touch" was an unintentional laugh. It was a poorly organized mess, terribly written and acted out. I tried to take advantage of the 1970s motor excitement. The film failed in many counts. Please consider the "curry" and "outrage" sneer (both directed by Brian de Palma). They were two exciting and entertaining films that dealt with the same subject.
