I picked up this title from a friend who was sitting in a comprehensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc set, and fortunately I did not have to pay for it. I had an idea that it would be a bad film, but I know what a really bad film after watching greats like children should not play with dead objects and incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed zombies, and now there is nothing really surprising to me They are surprisingly bad. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis is bad, but it does not reach that pleasant point of absolute pain that some films are exposed to. <br /> <br /> In any case, the general conspiracy is that the sun is about to unleash the massive solar flame towards the ground that will essentially destroy it. In order to counter this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a space ship and its crew to launch a counter-bomb (described by the aperture as "the most explosive ever") in the sun, which through some science fiction will trigger the glow at a different angle, Without being hurt. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that what I just described looks like a bad episode of the original Star Trek program. Even with a group of actors (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage this level of mediocrity, thanks to the plot that begins with simplicity, but becomes increasingly irrational over time. <br /> <br /> The culmination of this film disaster is the addition of an evil character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. Through means that have never been explained, he sends an evil agent to cut awkwardly awkward hair to practice some kind of mysterious mental electronic control in the genetic engineering world of the space crew, played by the female Anabel Schofield. Why is the sabotage of the mission? Because from his erroneous point of view, he thinks that the glow will not happen and that when that does not happen, he will become wonderfully rich because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. In fact, your villain has the most absurd stupid drives imaginable. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes amazingly amazing and develops very slowly, while characters with ambiguous or futile roles are used in a story. I can sit here and explain in detail exactly what is happening to show the inability of the screenwriter to do a plot that actually clicks on your attention or raises your attention, but I'm sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know the fact that this will take three pages, Losing your interest. But then again, you will probably get the same effect from watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is steeped in stumbling with the very bad dialogue. Imagine if all that ever happened at Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters produced the science fiction language back and forth in each other. Yes, I know, they did, but imagine if that was all they did, and they used the terms in question to create vague and semi-logical scenes that do not produce any excitement, tension or interest in the viewer at all. <br /> <br /> This is best illustrated at this point when a character in the Zero-G environment ties the bolt to a metal box before beginning to cry in agony for a few minutes before suddenly exploding. The script in the past hints at the personal risk of the explosion, but does not bother to give any strong answer to why it happened or how it happened, or why he could not really escape. All in all, you have an unfortunate intersection between strange and funny. <br /> <br /> Then we have many scenes where dramatic accumulation does not do anything. The performance of Jack Palance is lost on a character that only leads the boy hero (do not ask) about the desert, before being disturbed and killed by a set of allowances. On his deathbed, Ballance finally told our first protagonist by his last name (while wearing an awesome makeup job that made him look like someone putting a balloon under the eyeball), which had been quiet before. Col. Travis J. Richards. The boy quietly repeats it after its expiration, giving viewers the impression that the name has some importance later in the film. You may know Admiral Charlton Heston's character, and the plot will go ahead as soon as his name is repeated. Something. Anything. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. No hope of vanishing when this moment turns into just another attempt for many pathetic failed attempts to find a drama for a flat and cut personality forever, and will be a stain forever in the Balances profession, just like those in which the rest of the cast is mutilated. <br /> <br /> The completion of the film is a painful end, as Schofield tests the bomb in the middle of the sun in an attempt to recover its actions during the evil mantra, which is characterized by a series of very impressive visual effects, which, even for the obvious care that Placed in it, still able to always make the film seem more exotic as it really is. The most sad part of this film is the large, obvious budget, which tragically destroys one of the calligraphy pellets and the supporting text behind Boyle, Houston, and Ballens, who managed to fix the closed coffin with too much acting. <br /> <br /> Row: D-
