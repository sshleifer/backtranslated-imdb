Ridiculous, I can not say I like this film. The truth is I hate her. I tried to watch it as open-minded as possible, but when it comes to it, it seems insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> To me, there are several reasons for this. <br /> 1. The characters look abnormal. I have met a lot of players, from all walks of life. I do not know anyone acting like any characters in the film. It seems as if the producers of the film took the worst aspects of stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most of the players are social people, some of whom enjoy a fairly active life. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The style of ridicule is not appropriate for the film theme. The actual documentary about the players will work better. Although it has a good appearance (meaning it was put clean), it is not good. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue feels forced and unnatural. It also seems to lack any context in the real world. The players swear, I'll admit it, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor does not exist. Although the sense of humor I deplore is the mainstay of my group and many of the other groups I have encountered, it is less self-deprecating and more like a toilet toilet. Similarly, a large part of the gaming humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not a toilet humor. Most players would reject and deny anyone who made these jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically: accuracy. I do not mean rules, but rather dynamics. This film is often compared to the low-budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which depict players as real people playing a real game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie shows a position where you want to beat the players meaninglessly against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Hey, I know someone like that ... yeah, that's definitely like Gary."
