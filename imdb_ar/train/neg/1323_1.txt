It was the simplest time (the seventies), a simpler place (San Francisco), where a man can make a simple film about the psychic re-crucifixion of Christ as a woman on the acid with a dream sequence never ends the memories of the past while he was between sex orgasm regardless of financial responsibilities Or moral implications. <br /> <br /> This film, boring, slow, and boring, is the worst example of this kind of heavy school demonstration art passed as art in the mid-1970s. I love it too ! As soon as this train wreck begins to round up the endless slow motion dimensions, and the heavy echo echo guitar chords, you will not be able to get your eyes out of it until the absurd and silly end. It is a kind of intersection between the star of Jesus Christ, behind the Valley of the Dummies, and a truly sour ride with your parents on a waterbed. It is simultaneously a train wreck, absolutely amazing, and also a fantastic shot of the worst (or better) elements of the class bychadelic class. <br /> <br /> The plot. <br /> <br /> I will only tell you the plot because you will not be able to see what happens as a result of the repeated appearance of the temporary memory of events that may or may not have occurred to characters who may or may not be the same, and the unknown unknown face is endless flavors In a series of consecutive performances of silent acting such as street theater. <br /> <br /> "Logan" is a really annoying filmmaker who yells at people and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew always dropping acid and having what looks like a really nasty orgasm. Richard Dreyfus has an assistant role as an accountant. The film crew seems to hate him for some reason and burst into a maniacal laugh, perhaps to torture him. "Susan" pottery character is a blond of willow firmly inserted into space and relax the personality of the "artist" completely crazy. "Artist" will be quite angry, by the way. Either from exaggeration in his unbelievable reaction or unbelievable of his paintings. All of course the terrible nudes of Susan. There are some other characters that randomly show, cigar chomp character "guy". Which is also everything hot for Susan I think. He has monologue. I could not really tell what he was doing with the story, but everyone had to hate "the man" at the time and could not produce a movie without a film. There is also a mute girl. The crying girl finally pays off, trusting me incredibly.
