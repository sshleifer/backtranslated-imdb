Pick up your favorite seat and run in the playstation, as you toss this in the waste disposal unit. Spend 90 minutes useful. Live your favorite game. Disjointed - bad photography - non-directed junk. It takes parts of other "science fiction" movies and tries hard to combine the parts into a pathetically weak story. There's nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would bring a cash game, but a touch of ingenuity is needed to turn it into a good movie. No money spent watching this is a waste, and I personally like my 90 minutes of life again.
