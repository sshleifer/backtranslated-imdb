This movie is very bad and I can not believe it was actually filmed. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Have we actually seen the same movie? Or the same sh ** must say. Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) Will not go anywhere, quite incoherent, acting (some dialogues are simply silly), the degree of music (what does it mean?), Editing, especially artistic direction, pure catastrophe. Reminds me of old Macist movies ... To give you an example of amateur production, the Mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with a sparkle. I'm not joking, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the blunders we find here: you see in the scene an extra woman, fat about 200 pounds, talking about. cell phone. The next shot, which is located in a completely different place, can see this woman herself, and still talking on her cell phone (!) Yes, it has come to that. Great, huge, waste for money. without advantage.
