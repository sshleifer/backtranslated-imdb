I must say that the first to watch this movie was about 6 years ago and I really enjoyed it. I bought a DVD recently, and when I was watching for the second time I wondered why I liked it. The acting was terrible, and as usual we have the hippocampal clans in their fake uniforms. The representation was awful at best. Tim Roth did as well as Liam Nison did, but I have no idea what Jessica Lang was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot line was good, but the execution was bad. I'm fed up with seeing Scotland like this in movies. The brave heart was even worse, which is that these films are the only ones that offer grace. But seriously, people did not speak this way in those days, why do all actors have to have dialects of the Norwegian language? Just another film to try to capture the essence of tired and already annoying stereotypes. I noticed that the only people here who say this is a good film are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they want to, I know they have a fascination for men in Kielce. However, if you are thinking of buying a DVD, say you spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
