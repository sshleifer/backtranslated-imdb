I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it is Shakespeare that requires a particular mentality to be interested or not. But this film transcends any barrier to long-term solubility and what is not, may prevent many from just not care about the story of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this production is the full flatness of the characters. It is often difficult during interpersonal interaction to distinguish between who they are. Granted, I think this film is dubbed in English. Sure, they may be able to get vocal actors who can add more drama to these classic literary lines. <br /> <br /> It will be difficult to evaluate this movie more than 1, although it probably depends on biases probably age and what seems to be a very low budget. Still, it's very painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself an interest and read the book again. 10/01
