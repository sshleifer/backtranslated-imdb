Well, it was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second favorite so far, so I thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. <br /> <br /> Let's start with good. Teaser, was incredibly good and emotional too. Being a great animal lover and me, it was fun to see lots of beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then, all these things are bad, and believe me that there are plenty of them. Meaningless, so those animals were kidnapped by foreigners and impregnated? whaaa ??? The dialogue was also very terrible. There were about one or two lines of quotation. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the death of all these animals was not good for me. In the end ... what's the point? They all died pretty much. We did not learn anything, we did not enjoy, and I did not even find Sophia's sad death ... just a very frustrating star. <br /> <br /> * Star. Shame because Season 2 was fine.
