I read reviews of this, and while I do not expect special savings for Ryan, I was expecting a film of some kind. <br /> <br /> The film begins unilaterally with the usual introduction to history and how unity came into being. But immediately, it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. Accents, etc., very bad, where this unit is supposed to be of Hawaiian / Asian American origin, but everyone speaks very badly about the Harvard tradition of English for a Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I made this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I could not see more of it. The characters were 1 dimensional and although they were probably based on real people I had no feeling towards them and this left me not interested in them. A very bad direction for a very average TV movie which will be screened in the middle of the night on some cable channels. I was avoiding and looking for better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story but it deserves a better novel. I got the feeling that the director had seen a group of brothers and thought this was enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and watch a group of brothers, Tuskegee pilots, Glory or any other movie such as when trumpets fade ...
