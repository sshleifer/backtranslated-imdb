The man is the loser. Can not get the girls, needs to build, they are selected by more successful youth, and so on. I would say that Rob needs to go beyond Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler plots. There are two funny parts in the entire film. I could not even finish another 5 minutes. I was feeling bored. "Animal" is a good film. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot. But this was trying hard to convince. The jokes are very old. Trust me. This is not a film that most people can access. But some did, so I'll be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
