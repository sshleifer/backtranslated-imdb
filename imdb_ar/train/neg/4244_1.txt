Unlike my principles, let me first come to a conclusion, because I just saw this piece of "art" and I still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is very shocking, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if that was not true "44 minutes" "I was sick to death, which rarely happens to me. That does not make me feel better, and the fact that the film deserves to be rated high here. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the film? It has a modern title - "44 minutes." One thinks first of "15 minutes" The film is much better, but it is still bad in my book, and indeed it can be compared to a certain extent, but, as luck is, the things they share are the worst of their characteristics. Which clearly meets his strong Russian accent and popular prejudices, his goal is to appeal to the mind in the Cold War ah, do we miss the old good times.Now, I do not mean that he is a bad actor, but I have not yet judged his real performance, but he is simply not a real individual here, The point in the film when Taktarov explains to his companion that the Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America is really laughable. Do we assume that the greatest desire of the desperate couple is to become "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then, there is the media problem. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and correspondents. The manager was supposed to make us feel the 44-minute rhythm. Instead, he fills us with interviews throughout the film as in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes, the issue of media is the central issue. The point is presented in a way that the school speaks to an open student, but this deserves a separate comment. We are focusing on 44 minutes now. So, I was trying to determine the purpose of this film. What is that? To save time for the public? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Imagine violence? Oh yeah, give the Bible officer to the delinquent palace. So you must promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I just know I did not enjoy any of this. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I hope it is a bright spot, but I was wrong. It's not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a last note, comparing "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the film was one of the worst lines I have ever heard of. Scale 1-10, give it pure, fake 1.
