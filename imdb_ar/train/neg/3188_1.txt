The opening line of Joe says nothing about this film. It happens on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and includes Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian gangster. Joe's personality without bearing the name of Geronimo (pronounced Hironimo) and all he does in this film is to shoot people and arrest them repeatedly. Everyone in the film hates it, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked the image of Greydon earlier, "Angel's Revenge" because she was Shirin for boys at the age of thirteen. Avoid this movie at any cost!
