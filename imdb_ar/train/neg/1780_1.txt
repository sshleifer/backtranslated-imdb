This movie was very gay like a cat mother and son having sex, and they were scared of small kitty cats. They get shot by them. The strange thing for the cat's mother kills a man who stabs him in the back with an ear of corn? They are proof of lead. invisible. And what not. The movie star, Clovis, is a police cat, Clovis leads the police to find my strange mother, and after my mother kills the police, Clovis kills the mother by eating her head and then blazing. This movie sucks. It was a funny way more than it was scary, it was not scary at all. The girl hits the foreigner on the head with a camera and expels him. She then goes and hugs her. Then he grabs her and begins to rape her. Again, Clovis comes to save
