This was the worst film I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have nothing to do with other American pie movies, but the story is clear, flat and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Although the girls are cute, spending your time watching cheap porn movies is probably more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made from a very bad sex ad, prepared for an audience no older than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I have never visited an American college, but I strongly suspect that anyone who did it could really laugh at any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
