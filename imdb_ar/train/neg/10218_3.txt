** The spoilers received ** <br /> <br /> I heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the end in particular was appalling. What I did not expect was a complete change in the track with about twenty minutes to go. What begins as a Western Indian cowboy / cowboy suddenly descends into a romantic comedy that is too boring for Honus (the blue soldier from the title played by Peter Strauss) and Christa (Candice Bergen) who escaped a cavalry attack by Cheyenne. Much of the film focuses on these two non-identical characters and then the romantic comedy film. Donald Blaise, then kidnaps and kidnaps them both for no apparent reason. They then escape and appear both (separately) at the base of the Knights on the eve of the attack on the Cheyenne base. As Christa used to marry a Cheyenne tribal leader, she fled from and joined the cavalry. So far so ordinary. Then comes the end. After carrying more than an hour of bad acting that involves cliches will not collect a story, then the film becomes a big exploit that includes, inter alia, a head and a child shot at the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this stage of the film, but The Wild Bunch kept the same tone and did not resort to excessive violence. In some ways, the Blue Soldier reminds me of Frank Perry last summer, who also changed completely to end the shock. I did not hate the Blue Soldier and did not find the ending particularly troublesome but I found it very boring with an unnecessarily violent end. If you want to watch a movie with a really disturbing massacre of innocents, I recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
