Robert Taylor himself has certainly shown himself as a wonderful drama actor in his role as a buffalo fisherman carrying a weapon in southwest 1956. It was one of the few times Taylor played a heavy role in a film. However, this picture was far from being great soon after, Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned into a formidable performer as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a fanatic here, and his hatred of the Indians really shows up. <br /> <br /> The other good performance here was veteran actor Lloyd Nolan, an elderly man, drinking the old timer who joined in the search for the buffalo as well. In his early scenes, Nolan was really doing a great job for Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Note Ross's appearance in the film. The following year Tamblyn and Nolan will join the massive Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> Writing in the film is cruel at best. At the end of the film, elements of nature were presented by Taylor. What about the elements of writing here?
