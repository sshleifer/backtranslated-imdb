The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, implementation makes it go down. <br /> <br /> The movie lacks speed, for one reason. The trip must be exciting, but it is slow and more than to be a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem lies mainly in the script and editing. There are no obstacles and reflections enough to intensify the thrill, and there are scenes that do not convey the story actually significantly. <br /> <br /> Producers had to see this in the scenario and insist on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the product is a writer and director too, obviously this will not happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that a lot of acting seems flat, and this is due to the director - all the actors they have had been fully qualified in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's shameful, because with writing, editing and directing the best, it could have been a really great film.
