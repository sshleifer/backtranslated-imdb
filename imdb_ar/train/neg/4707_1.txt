Kakshi This was the most painful experience in my life watching this. I can even finish what happens to Nick. The best thing about a teenager is Nick Drake and Josh and this is about to break out of the air. Children's songs are somewhat annoying as well as children. My little sister wanted to watch the show because she liked anything that comes on Disney or Nick usually, but after finishing watching this show she said "one of the worst shows I've seen is so boring" my little brother already fell asleep envious. In short, if you are 3 years old without mental activity, you will enjoy this offer, otherwise change the channel now.
