Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Freaks <br /> <br /> Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbett <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2? 1! Thunderbird is GO! <br /> <br /> So I started Thunderbirds, my favorite childhood. When I heard they would make Thunderbird, I was active. I could not wait to see the Thunderbird 2 roar to save people, while the Thunderbird 4 was immersed deep in ?? You get the idea. I could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the film was finally released. Critics criticize him, but I still want to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all I cared about. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50 people, everyone was over thirty and under ten. Maybe it was the most critical theater experience I've ever experienced? <br /> <br /> The film (intended to be a prelude) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest Tracy family. He spends his days wishing he could save people like the rest of his family, but he is young. One day, he finally got his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) blew the rest of his family at Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This involves having to beat The Hood followers and save his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot looks like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once you get the movie mode? What a mess we have. First, the film was for children, just like the original show. However, Jerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children programming. On the other hand, he overlooks the plot because he tries to make himself a piece of Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a film that tries to attract fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while it is completely missing. All the lame jokes, cartoon sounds and stupid idiots that nobody finds really amusing are found all over this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Farkis wishes he never draws this. <br /> <br /> On everyone, everyone has made a strong performance, taking into account the text given to all of them. Ben Kingsley was exceptional like The Hood, where he played very well. My only complaint about the characters is from the followers of The Hood, who are turned into remnants of the old Looney Tunes cartoons, and surprisingly they follow the children easily. <br /> <br /> What's strange about this movie is that while I was watching the movie, I was enjoying it. But as soon as the lights went on, I realized that the film was fairly bad, I was lighter by $ 8, and two hours went from my time now. Pleasure guilty? Probably. However, the Thunderbird is a forgotten mess. Instead of a great "jump", I should recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the movie could be like the first 10 minutes of it, it would be a great movie worth the name of Thunderbirds. However, we get a movie that only the Thunderbirds fans like (if you want to see your childhood torn apart) or the extreme boredom you have to take care of. <br /> <br /> The Thunderbirds classification is 1 النجوم stars.
