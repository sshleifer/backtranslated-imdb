It was hard to get this movie, and when I finally saw it it was a big disappointment. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the 20th century: an anonymous man who benefits from the unsuspecting airline industry and gets millions ransom without hurting anyone or spoiling the attempt. With all this internal attention, how can anyone make such a frantic event by talking about this real event. While Williams is always interesting, suppose a scriptwriter that de. Cooper's character was typically heroic like a movie star. What we get is kind of without any attractive details or insight into the mind of someone bold enough and smart enough to get him out. Harrold practically steals the film with its brave and net beauty, but the real disappointment was in dealing with the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this film even exists.
