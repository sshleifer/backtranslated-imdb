A lot of subjects or parts of the story are the same as in Lyon, then the other parts felt like another film, do not know anything, but there is a familiar feeling about the entire film. It was good to see him, but it was great! If the story is more original. The little girl, a bad killer of Leon, is a little tweaked. The opening scenes are really good :-) Strange that people like fighting in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem was remembering the parts that were of Leon and Nicita and if they were from the French or American version. If you do not see Leon, this is a good film. If you like this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best Regards / Rick
