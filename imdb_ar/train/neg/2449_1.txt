Bashki should be congratulated for trying to turn one of the great fairy tales from English fiction into a film, then slap him silly for this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters were silly, the music was muddled, and the film was reckless raids through the first book and half a masterpiece of Tolkien. I still remember my disgusting disappointment and hatred of the film when I first saw it. I realize now that any attempt to turn a book into a movie must fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
