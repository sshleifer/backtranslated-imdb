The film begins with a beautiful lady wearing a torn white dress that runs through a typical Eastern European city. We know that they follow something, because they continue to look behind it. Soon we see that she is being chased by a mysterious man in a black trench. Then realize that the man is actually a vampire hunter and that he is behind them. But look is that its a reflection in the store window ?? Do not just have her twin vampires! Unfortunately, they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this astonishingly wonderful and amazing restoration of old hammer films in the 1960s and 1970s (in credits, the twins were listed as twins of evil, and of course the name of the last installment in the Cranstein hammer trilogy), the plot is largely dead . <br /> <br /> Dracula's small plot (which changes its appearance easily every time it is reborn, so the product does not do it "should look at the same Dracula) when coming to the morgue, realizing I would probably neglect all those films that say drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and using vampire blood to find a cure for a jerk friend's disease. "Obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> br /> <br /> A new concept, but it was pulled out very badly, and the film continues to set up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, average students are trying to bring life back to drac by placing it in a blood-soaked tub in an isolated country that is walking nearby. "The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film, but will we stay there? Not because they decided to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool, sighing.This film faces a real problem with "greetings" as I mentioned before the opening scene was just outside the hammer, and this home scene was perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the film quickly turns the gears and changes into horror Medical. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they offer many characters almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are Med students and their wheelchair-bound friend of the "friend" type, and all the med students are arrogant, bored, bored and stupid. How they made it in middle school surprised me, unless the medical school had to meet its large / large share of the breast. Then there is a vampire hunter who is still obscure through the film. Hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not set it up like it would be. Then you have random priests, cops, and types of science. Many people are introduced and then forgotten so quickly that they need that person either to save the day or jump for cheap intimidation until it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> This is a lazy movie. No real fear, just a few predictable jump fears. The setting for these is too complicated they are hilarious. L Examp LE Full Bath Tub. It is clear that Drac will emerge from the mysterious blood. However, we have to wait long to get to the inevitable jumping scare. Then a student kills the bigger and bigger drum. We all know they will become one of the undead. But what do others do? Buried in a shallow graveyard near the house. Sigh, so you know who will jump on you when the police appear at home .......... <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will hint that it's impossible to make a scary vampire movie and go into the atmosphere, then we'll end with a whole good movie like the opening scene. <br /> <br />
