I recently saw this with my wife and discovered that it was better than Ken thought, although he was not a cop too much. The greatest playwright in Britain does not seem interested in this role, which is unfortunate because he may have raised it more convincingly in his play. Rex Harrison seems less disturbing, and perhaps not surprising, because his character is badly written. William Holden is better than that, but his screen time wears off quickly, and again, his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman as I have seen her in my life, but she does not get much to do, the film may have gained a lot by focusing more on her story. Ostenov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character does not fit into the serious movie tone. The music is poor, Omar Sharif makes one of many useless fountain firings (his career has been based on this for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer should be blamed for not directing him more effectively, an unpredictably outrageous film director, one of his most vulnerable films.
