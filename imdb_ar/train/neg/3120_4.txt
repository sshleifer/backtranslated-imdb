I did not expect much from the "Night Listener" and I never heard of him until I saw the cover in the video store. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspense and tension. Sometimes it pulls a little, but it actually helps you to know what will happen and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into a "cat and mouse" game to the point where he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth and being around a 14-year-old abused child who seems to be nobody I have seen personally. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is fascinating in building suspense throughout the film, keeping you very much in the shadow of who lies and what is real. However, in the end it is a kind of frustration and does not live up to its potential. Does not give you a detailed or acceptable explanation for the other main character, which was useful and interesting.
