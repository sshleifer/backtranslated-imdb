Well first, I would like to add that I am somewhat dated myself, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. The movie is certainly fun, but the fact that it does not fully rely on real facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth; he worked with the Jews before the First World War. Yet during the First World War he then shaped his views on the Jews. His origin in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler was not a disturbing little child. He had more or less physical education. Nothing has been mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to Hitler's puzzle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor but does not really fit in with Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he was here. Under his youth, he was an attractive figure who "manipulated" people through his charm. His unstable behavior and angry outbursts began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate when people point fingers at Hitler and others, for example, and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story exactly as it was, so that everyone can know what it was! It was supposed to be behind this film some research before doing so. Because it seems as though they did not know what actually happened. Hitler was not portrayed even in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was snatched from the socket. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this.
