I am an arty movie enthusiast, but unfortunately I have to report this movie to be a humming drive. Painfully slow in developing a non-existent conspiracy based on a promising hypothesis, experience, we must say, we try. Even after bad films, I feel like I'm learning something, or enjoying some aspects, but there was nothing I could appreciate. The premise was not interesting, but the film begins and ends there. The acting was good, although the characters were quite boring. In order to achieve this bold goal, the hero is completely empty. Pity. I usually enjoy heterogeneous films, but you should not be confused with the lack of format and small content.
