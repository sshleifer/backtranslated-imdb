I've just watched this movie last night and have been warned to anyone else thinking of seeing this movie. In a word - no. I seriously feel that this was something that was written by a scriptwriter at the Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy stage, meaning that every other word was a curse word. I have no problem with the heavy curses, as in "Good Will Hunting", provided that they help to go into more characters. In this case, it was just a hollow joking with an attempt to draw an accidental * streamer * or laughter from the audience. The three main characters are all their unique stereotypes, the shiver of Wall Street, the shiver of the cafe, and "I'm not just gay in contact with my female side" of the unaccountable one. You just do not give a damn about any of them! They are all losers, shallow and unappealing and you want to lose them. For those who dare, this film has funny moments and a beginning and an end. The scene toilet / vibrator funny Kinda sick way "oh yes." Really, though, I would only recommend this film to my worst enemies.
