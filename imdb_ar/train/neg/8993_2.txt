Back in 70, when I first saw this, I was in high school. It was cool afterwards. Now as an adult, I go back and tell myself .. yes true. What was so funny? It's moments but few and far between. He is so dated that jokes no longer stand. This showed to the younger crowd and would be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you might want to stick to Kentucky Fried or Amazon Women from the Moon. The Vision Tunnel as well as the Groove Tube are too old to display today.
