For a man who had a relationship with a woman, he found out where he and his new wife, killing a wife,, making it look like a rape, ... ... . <br /> <br /> In her illusion, she told everyone that the man asked her to marry him .. so she left her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> < > The last thing I heard was in a mental institution, a security prison .... <br /> <br /> He was still wearing an engagement ring. She bought it for herself ... and informed everyone that he bought it for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,, and the killings took place in Minnesota .... <br /> <br /> There was even an important story in People magazine "... spring of 1988, I want to say it on page 39.
