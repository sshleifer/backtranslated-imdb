Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired car thief who was forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not being charged with the British crime director Raymond Calitri. The job involves "lifting" 50 cars within 24 hours or that Calitri will be punished. Rains quickly gathers a crew that he can trust and take over. But his police, some cars on the list is not easy. It may seem almost impossible to complete the task. <br /> <br /> You've got a fantastic crew in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duval, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Johnny, Giovanni Ribesi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Kan and Timothy Olivant. They all deserve the best. Enough horsepower out there to push the Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is, that this is the case of a lot of cars that pile up in the parking lot, and many characters, not enough enthusiasm. Without a doubt, this is undoubtedly the production of Bruckheimer / Simpson, a text written in loud language with high voices and a whip of cheeses, a scattergun, and a heavy hammer from Dominique Senna. It's basically a great new edition of the budget for H.B. Halicki's 1974 film of the same name, with a hypothesis that offers the possibility of a film based on a car that works with adrenaline. Potential that unfortunately did not materialize. There are one or two moments of great influence, certainly, but absolutely enjoyable. But if you pardon the pun, the film will never run out, it will be more content to work with a group of characters plotting to try to make a screenplay [Scott Rosenberg} working. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something out of it {the cars are on the eye}, and unintentional comedy fans will get caught {see Ecclestone's melancholy moment}. But no, she's really poor. 10/04
