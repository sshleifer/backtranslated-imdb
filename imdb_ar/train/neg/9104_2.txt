<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it was manufactured. In my opinion, harsh intentions were one of the best films directed at teenagers that were produced years ago. This prequel was certain things that did not match the original. (Sebastian's father married wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on the long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I discovered today that it was not supposed to be a new film, but the Manchester TV series. After hearing it, it made sense to me that it was not like the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in television format. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Campbell probably added the end of the film, after not being picked up by Fox. It seems like something will happen very quickly (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharine) and I do not know where they will go with the next episode, because it will not lead to the 1999 film (the latter is directed towards the right.) <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was that he suggested Sebastian and his father had married in wealth, which did not look good in this area of ​​New York. , Catherine's mother was the condition just a copy of her adult, does not look like a woman would in her position, marry a man is not her social class. <br /> <br /> As in the introduction this is fairly lame. But I was interested to know where this went as a series.
