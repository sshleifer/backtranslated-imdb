If cruelty and absolute death were at least the object of the story to justify their inclusion, the text was completely incomprehensible and completely stupid. <br /> <br /> He did not go anywhere, and the story had no clear continuity. It was just a bunch of senseless sniffing scenes and the stupid ending that was treated as if to say, "The end, the sound of whistling. You who hate me and the few defenders who see my trash." <br /> <br /> I do not understand that, a masked assassin has never been his conviction in prison, a scene of rape in prison was supposed to be the guards raping the serial killer ugly ugly and kill him and nothing else? There is no explanation, no punishment, a really weak police chief who was a waste of a representative like Barry, who did not try to get rid of the man who killed his men, tortured a child, a woman and a dog and sent them to watch the video. <br /> <br /> The police who for some reason wandered for themselves in the dark alone in the house of his farm at night like a bunch of poorly written teen characters to kill a person at a time like a bunch of idiots, and not hear any other policeman die in the dark one One after the other and just continue to roam for no reason until they all die in turn. <br /> <br /> Initially a group of snakes to the real horrific animals at first without any reason or explanation, would he remember him, was he watching for masturbation, was a comedy for him ... What was it? Both are just thinking of throwing it into the heart of animal lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> Pare then signs the psychological path to allow his family to leave if he kills himself ... a more na√Øve and stupid cop you've never seen before in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why I do not try to hate his works altogether. I try to find some reasons to explain the art of horror book but these things ... pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> Boll What do you do anymore? I hope you know that because I know a lot of eligible people who can not dream to get the budget they get repeatedly to produce their movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Boll actually at its best check out the "mail" was really fine.
