Wow, what a total let down! The fact that people think that this scary film is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip to the "ring". the story? Was there one? Not in my opinion .. just a bunch of brilliant photography. The whole movie was boring, stupid, messy. I think there's always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I've seen in years. And this chick roast? Well, she's a bad actress! Like Barbie plastic and like his talent .. No, wait, it will be an insult to Barbie's talents! I assume that many children helped this film at the box office because it was a PG-13, even if it was rated R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!
