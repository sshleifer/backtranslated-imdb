This must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only interesting thing about this film is the appearance of a veil from some great genre directors and the same king. The film has a wonderful introduction, but it collapses after about 15 minutes of the story. I liked the Amic Madden in this film and I think she can have a very good career in the film.
