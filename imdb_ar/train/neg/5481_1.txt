<br /> <br /> Foreign visitors do not seem quite as perfect as an eccentric pharaoh and not only foreign visitors are able to speak perfectly English (in Australian dialect) but also name their stars by the names of secular astronomers who have given them! <br /> <br /> Taking all these strange things, all alien beings know exactly how humans suffer from evil, evil and waste. They are quite ready to tell us how serious this is. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do not. Well, unless you have insomnia or options for this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film tries to get a moral and ecological point, but only succeeds in making you dance and pray. .
