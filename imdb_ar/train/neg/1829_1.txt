Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben Stiller anymore. How this man allows still makes movies is beyond me. I can not understand how this happens if I study in the way I act in a movie, I will shoot and have a company ... and I will have to shoot myself. Allah! This film was just a pile of simple POO, evaporation, refreshed, which needs to be displaced if possible. Another thing I have to say is that the guideline about 10 lines of text in the commentary is stupid. What's wrong with saying some things about the film? I will never understand why websites require a short written novel when a brief comment is sometimes necessary.
