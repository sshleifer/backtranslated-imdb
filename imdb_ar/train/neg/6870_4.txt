A good-faith film about Sonya Horowitz (Renee Zellweger), the religious Jewish girl's wife Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). Who is very upset. Mendel's brother (Christopher Ecclestone) sees this and employs her to work in the field where she is already an expert. She also begins an affair with her, and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he empties her and betrays her to the family, which closes her. There is a sub-plot in which Sonia's brother, who is dead with her, appears to take the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is unclear. Much unclear, unfortunately, including what is going on with Sonja, why do you tell Rebbe that there is a fire inside her, maybe not from God, what does that mean, and what a magical beggar woman tells him. To a certain extent, the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, yet Sonja has not been completely liberated. The idea of ​​love is not replaced by a man of another genus well thought out. The title comes from the Biblical definition of the value of a good woman? However he is the littering messenger who transferred him to Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the part; she is supposed to be a Midwestern Jew and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times the distinctive sounds are taken from Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is tough and takes over, but the film is in a mess.
