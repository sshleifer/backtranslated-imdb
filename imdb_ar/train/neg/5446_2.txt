For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this video. Producers decided to become creative and to make this video in the 1980s a science fiction story, including the villainous Barbarella, from whom the band got his name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that, in the middle of some of the great 80's songs of Duran Duran, there are broken, confusing and disturbing scenes that show the fictional rivalry that tries to stop the band at one of her concerts. Good music is not interrupted again and again, but we must also suffer through a cheap transient story hosted by Dr. Mario the villain. It's almost too much to bear. 10/02
