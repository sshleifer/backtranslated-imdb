This film has potential, but what makes it really bad is the representation of Lindsay Cross. I've never seen it before and maybe there are some fans of Crouse like it in something else, but its performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> ROBOTY delivered it. When she handed over her lines, she seemed to be trying to make sure she had the right lines and she was simply reading from the menu in her head. Therefore, her voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that a bad person in acting has been given a major role in the film. She must know someone in this area. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to be concerned about this, but the comment should be "long" and its performance is what goes on more than anything else. However, I liked where the story was going, so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script contains good movies. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if it were her best, I would have liked it.
