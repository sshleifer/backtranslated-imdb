I enjoyed this film, but Van Dam does the same old time in the old garbage after a while. Stool Kelson Fight the viewer by habit. The only thing left by this loser is that the Russians end up killing in the end. This movie is the absolute dog that is doing the highest level of nature, please please please Van Damme get some acting lessons, you need it. Anyone who likes Van Damme has problems, it seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets in any act of acting is when he co-writes the film, makes a film co and runs the screen for the film. Avoid the DAMME VAN and dropped his bad wig. I gave this film two out of ten, because the film that was carrying the sand was better. To add insult to injury, I wasted in return for this fertilizer
