Nice attempt and good ideas (salvation from a bitch and humans help each other, ...) but a bad result ... It is clear that the director tried to emulate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating the supposed atmosphere filmed by Viet Nam ... The only problem is That Viet Nam had long since gone and when the "green papaya smell" had a historical background ... trying to highlight that kind of atmosphere (the muffled voices and slow pace of life). ..) in modern days leaves a false feeling. It also creates a quick sense of boredom and the result becomes very clear. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action is taking place in Saigon or Da Nang because this is where Harvey Keitel, a former soldier in the film, may have been stationed during the war ... but in southern Vietnam, No one or very few people are talking with a northern tone clip that the actors introduced ... very strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write detailed Vietnamese poetry, ... even more doubtful ... <br /> < br />
