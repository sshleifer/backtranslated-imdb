This film was physically painful to sit down, perhaps because I (like many people in my age and younger) grew up with Dr. Suss and loved his books - funny, smart, strange and full of agitation at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" absorbs all the attention and raises his spark of the story, and Mike Meyer's performance where Cat is often puzzling. Why does the Porsche ring tone, unusual click, inappropriate jokes, and uncooperative uniforms? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are simple. This movie is OVERBLOWN and its style is very long. <br /> <br /> Do not expect every movie for all children to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this film sets a new low. How can Mike Myers get the money?
