The 2005 "gore porn" gave us a very decent flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; even a decent rip of the inn. Live Feed follows exactly the same formula for the previous film Eli Roth, except this time it is the clumsy children in Asia rather than Central Europe. The plot focuses on these dumb children, and one of them harassed one of the locals until they find themselves in trouble. Local residents decide to lock them all in the theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I have heard some unfavorable things about this film before watching it, I still hope it is at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson had earlier shot "Torched" which lasted for 45 minutes too, Because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. It is clear that the film is trying to return to the good old days of Grindhouse (which Hostel did successfully), but it really did not pay off. It is surprising to think of Nicholson's former work in special effects - not even the impressive Jour ... although he is much better acting! There is nothing else I can say about this film ... it's bad and not in a good way. avoid it!
