There are some truly brilliant ideas in this violent film, if it is clearly executed, it has been lifted from the Western Spaghetti to something special. Unfortunately, A TALL CELLED HELL is one of the worst movies imaginable! The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for long periods, the performances (and accents) of the actors are somewhat inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary, after taking part in the elimination of the village, remains to become a priest (!) ... Ten years later, the village is run by "Mayor" Tally Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives in search of revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau looking for Shaw. They are all screaming at each other and there are plenty and shoot each other a lot. Fernando Rey is also (as a blind man). Offers are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas tone sometimes as does Landau (which is really grating here). Shaw and Rey prove that they are unable to really embarrass themselves and that Stevens seems very vague (if a bit of a place between the filth).
