Of all the films I have seen, this movie, The Rage, should be one of the worst films to date. The direction, the logic, the continuity, the changes in the manuscript and the dialogue made me weep with pain. "How can anyone come up with something too crazy?" Gary Busey knows his films "B", but this movie "W" is certain. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example: about twenty FBI and local officers surrounded a trailer house with a jeep. Inside the pocket is MA and "confused" why all the policemen around. Within seconds a huge battle battle ensued, Master killed directly. The policemen explode in the pocket with Gary and the company explodes on them. The police, like the dominoes and Gary's jeep, fall into circles and do not hit a single bullet. MA was killed and it seems that Gary did not curse this tough man. Really a miracle, not since the six-shot 300-shot shooter there was such a miracle.
