An absolute evaporation pile of cow dung. It is interesting to me that this film was produced. Hip-hop and old Westerners do not seem to mix. What target audience these people were thinking about when planning this train wreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and drawing a joke, but the representation is terrible and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare movie makes their whole career a joke. The chick should never be forgiven of being ignorant and stripped of any remaining dignity it has. After reading the first 10 pages of the dialogue, she should have asked about one of her friends who was playing this sick joke. After some research, I already found a list of some of the other actors who moved this film: Jada Pinkett Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardashian, Gina Jameson, Oprah, and finally Marg Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the best stare at an empty TV instead of watching this movie again.
