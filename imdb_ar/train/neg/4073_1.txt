There are no spoilers. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this must be the poorest attempt to make it one at all. His name "film" is also an extension. This is "random footage of clear and delightful violence and ugly violence - women who try to act - sexy - liberated - bad - together" are not worth watching. <br /> <Watching this is like watching an interesting family photo, and enjoying the same quality you expect when sending your 10-year-old son to the jungle with your new camcorder and asking him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
