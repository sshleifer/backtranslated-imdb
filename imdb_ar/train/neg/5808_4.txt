Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a hot and powerful Hollywood couple, they filmed this new version of "The Scenery of 1972" by Steve McQueen-Ali McGraw from the thriller about a fugitive duo. This process was successful for the first time because McQueen was a vital presence on the screen - even the stony and empty silence, you can feel its timed hour, and its attractive magnetism. Baldwin does not belong to Steve McQueen, but he has his charm and may be a more versatile representative - if so, this is not an offer of his character. Basinger works well and certainly looks good, but James Woods swings artificially in a ridiculous magnetic role. A sub-plot involving another couple held by the former partner of Baldwin was unbearable in "72" and played worse here. As for the movement scenes, it is a very old hat, which makes one wonder: Why even rework the original? ** from ****
