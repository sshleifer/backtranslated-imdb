Warning! The spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your Disney Model movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Correctly correct what is in the nursery home that has an equal division of the races. <br /> <br /> 2. The viewer's intelligence is reflected in its simplified lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The slave boy's father is taken almost directly from a never-ending story. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crime, disposal, corruption, famine, and other things to pay attention to, only the loser team deserves divine intervention. UGHHHH !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Did you know that the angels do not like the right ?! Where did that come from? <br /> <br /> 6. In helping the team, the landlords cause pain and suffering to the opposing team. Really very angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. The team called Angels Help ... You can guess ... Angels! Disney at its worst! 8. "Just got his training wings." Metallic line! <br /> <br /> My pessimism: I did not like it at all.
