No wonder Pamela Springsteen gives up acting to become a full-time photographer. It's a much better idea to have a camera behind in front of one. Although this film is not without its interesting elements (patches of hell, etc.), it excels only flaws. For one reason, Angela, the assassin's advisor, seems to be at the same age as the camp. The presence of an older and more threatening camp manager would have done much for the film. Then you have murder scenes. The budget seems so low that most of it can not be implemented properly (not pun intended), although the fact that a person drowns in a toilet in an external building is certainly authentic. But in general, there are plenty of movies that are more terrifying / fun to spend an hour and a half watching your life.
