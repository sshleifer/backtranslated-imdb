Some consider it a classic film - I have no idea why. It's so terrible to be funny. The only saving grace in this film is to make cheese lines so that the soles of the feet are so embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of good songs and good choreography in this movie movie, but what about it! There is no plot, the theater is placed without changing the scene, and Michael Douglas is as frustrating as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said I would not believe how bad a movie could happen! He was right. <br /> <br /> Usually with a movie of this horror, I recommend that people do not watch it, but in this case I think people should, because it will put every other bad film I have seen in perspective.
