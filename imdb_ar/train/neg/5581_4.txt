The 1960s (1999) D. Mark Biznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Steeles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sesto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as full-length film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The first half of the film drives the excellent performance of Dutton as Rev. Willy Taylor and equally publishes the story story among families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway up and the whole black family is forgotten in the second half of the dull, uncompromising and dodgy. Rating: 4 out of 10. Uncategorized (PG-13 released for video / DVD version).
