The only good thing about "the people I know" is that it is an ideal example of the films that the Pacino must avoid. The first big turnout I had was how Pacheco tried to portray the Georgian dialect; sometimes it was weak and unattractive while in other sectors it seemed too exaggerated. Dialogue and personal interaction were terrible with a weak conspiracy. The support team did a great job of keeping the movie interesting, and in an hour I still do not see any signs of a strong conspiracy. The story in general is a real game, and I had to slap my face several times to keep myself awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will definitely affect you ... avoid it at all costs.
