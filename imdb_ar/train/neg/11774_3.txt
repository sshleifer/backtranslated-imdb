I made a sad mistake to see this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. He has been well shot from the start, but this is my last positive comment about the film. The acting was awful, and I wonder if the actual Jojo girls were hired? But it was a plot that was really funny, in fact it was funny and not boring is the only reason I gave it to this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** The spoilers below **. <br /> I just want to mention some scenes that made the audience really laugh:. <br /> <br /> The girl pushed in the field: who would have thought that a child pushing another child could behave so badly. A real opening game. <br /> <br /> Get the bus scene: the girl is going on the bus. But, according to music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> Rolling down under the line of clothing: Wow, this really illustrates the author's storytelling skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skill. Why do not you make them perform all three sins at once? At least after that, the film may have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> Running on the ladders of the mall: Watch as one of the girls sets off on the stairs followed by the meat eating Dow, do not wait. She * just * walks quickly trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> Running with Blood: This is definitely my favorite show, and an appropriate end to the movie. A red-painted marathon race, completed by jumping over the stairs and on the bridge, to be accidentally sent by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is being done more obsessed girls in the film, now adheres to your personality. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this movie was created for 16 years. The old and their colleagues. Unfortunately, after I met the manager at the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But, if you are in a cynical mood, imagine a laugh with a few colleagues .. if you still do not do it. So think about it.
