Well, obviously Ppl that the film was good in 1955. <br /> <br /> I pity the fools who still believe it ... his absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story is fair. .. silly characters are silly cartoons - but this film is not meant to inspire, am I sure it is intended to be a serious drama is not it? <br /> <br /> Dean and others, too old to score their parts. People say that Dean is wonderful in this film, and may also play his role and may be. His character aims to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made the film. His vision is tormenting, and he makes small tantrums like a 4-year-old boy ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is wonderful, but the early scenes at the police station where she cries and cries are very unconvincing. It's a bad precedent for the film ... and the rest of it, you feel like you're rocking every time one of those emotional scenes that behave badly. <br /> <br /> It may be good for her time, but, in fact, his engine. <br /> <br /> It should just be a din about Dean's death that has inflated the reputation of this film.
