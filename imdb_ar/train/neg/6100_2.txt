A lateral effort (this is not a review of goodwill, about the final product), this film is poorly written, over-performance, and poorly directed. It is clear that the story had potential, but this story does not exist in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human being. She had emotions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-doubt. You will not know this through this film about the lead actress performance. In fact this applies to every character in the film, but in the case of Barton: each phrase is a letter. Epic on top of speech as if it were an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in one board meeting, I realized it because it speaks! Every idea has an incredible context and comes up with ideas that seem to take a life of soul searching right away. For example, when you see a wounded man, you will begin to clarify about the needs of the battlefield, protect the soldiers, place white flags, and so forth. As it was shown in the film, there is no way to reach such a thoughtful thought detail in seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film steals Clara Barton from her struggle. It deprives them of their humanity, and by nature they are cheaper than all that I did because the text is written in cliches. The author does not know Clara Barton, and seems to have adopted in his book an article on the Encyclopedia Britannica. (Yes they had those at the time) but hey, Technicolor is nice! (who cares)
