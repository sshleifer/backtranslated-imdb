I rented this movie about 3 years ago and still stands out in my mind as the worst film ever produced. I do not think I ever finished. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember that they did the flashback action of 1970. In the flashback there was a man wearing a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer 4x4, like the Toyota RAV4 or something (I do not remember). I do not understand how they could say that in the 1970s. Maybe he also had a cell phone, I can not remember, it was terrible. I prepared it to the video store and asked him why they were carrying the film and whether I could recover my watch. To this day it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some very bad movies.
