Leonard Malten, who is often reliable, says this is a "delightful romance" and that Sanders is "wonderful". Maltin must be mixing this film with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and wonderful, as usual, ?? You can imagine his connection to the line about adultery, "Sometimes marriage chains are so heavy that you have to carry them three times," but this boring, wooded, and dated film is more accurate. The same story, biography with Sanders as a brilliant jewel thief, Fran√ßois Eugene Fedok, who becomes a police commander but can barely resist the temptation of fine jewelry, amusing enough, but has the same kind of Hollywood Hollywood historical treatment that is marred by epic period like * Marie Antoinette *, And certainly unfortunate * Forever Amber * (which screams for a neat new version). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries to add some depth to his personality, the whole thing has nothing. I am a fan of Douglas Cirque without shame, but this is 1946, one of the first American efforts of the Circus, which lacks many distinctive touches that will determine the trays of vases that are implanted breast. He started circling his foot here, making a number of memorable movies over the next 10 years until he reached gold with the wonderful * mania *, and walked briskly in our bombing of estrogen festivals like * All That Heaven Allows *, * Imitation of life. But a scandal in Paris is hardly his best? Relatively low cost relationship with cheesy collections and costuming is ineffective.
