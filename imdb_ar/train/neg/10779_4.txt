I found this movie to be an absolute disappointment. The talent available to the director - especially Stanley Toatchy, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin (even without reference to the four main roles) - has completely wasted a modest story, no one can really care about once presented to the bleak and stereoscopic characters. Julia Roberts is weak, and Zeta Jones is just annoying (apparently to restore her role of high precision, minus humor), playing only the same crystal as the very old, energetic, nervous, and disturbing elegance, and simply passing Kozak. , Seems to be bored of the entire project. <br /> <br /> Because it is supposed to be a "romantic comedy," there is absolutely no love between the central characters, not to mention chemistry, and as in the comedies - well, the only moments of moderate humor Lagging behind the role of Cusack in the Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - it is clear that the scriptwriter is unable to show any originality at all. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably entertaining as the Mexican lover and Walken played an ironic role as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-dogme, but these parts were very short on screen, and instead Spoilers we treated Billy Crystal His nose is swollen with the dog. A pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a great admirer of John Cusack's work, not to mention the other wonderful actors, she has completely failed a film with many good ideas, and at the same time is totally unwilling to explore or detail any of them, rather than To resort to the same vulgar passages of the same old type and even to reduce the level of humor "sometimes filled with adolescents". Very poor 4/10.
