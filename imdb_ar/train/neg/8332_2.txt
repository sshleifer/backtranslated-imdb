Shiner, directed by Christian Kalson, focuses on three "pairs" and their relationships with mania and violence. A good start as far as I'm concerned. interesting. Couples are divided into two different sex couples, two male friends of different sexes and a straight man being "harmless" by a gay man. <br /> <br /> The couple "het" have no big movie role. There are some scenes that show how they want to be aggressive when having sex or playing with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose because they are marginalized. The default is that it represents a daily example of how to integrate gender / violence into couples' lives. The couple were not very aggressive and were not shot in any exciting way. As characters, do not add much to the character or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends form the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay types by convincing a gay man to have sex with them in an alley. This escalates into violence. Violence is changing them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. Their need for violence increases as the film progresses. My main problem is that violence is not convincing. Never once does any of the characters appear to be in any real danger. It just does not work. Since the whole subject of the film revolves around the relationships of characters with violence, this is a big problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does not help either. Sometimes, it's OK, and sometimes it's too bad. In one scene, I really wondered why someone had smeared his face. Confusing. <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is the Chaser Husband. Here, he seemed to have a lot to say and was able to develop a more coherent story. Perhaps this is because the characters seem more sophisticated and have a decision in the end. Maybe Shiner was better off if he stuck to those two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Kelson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is a nice. Most low budget clicks do not aspire to much. I do not think Kalson made a wish to achieve it. By myself, I found nothing particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was unconvinced. But that does not mean the director can not achieve anything with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to have something to say.
