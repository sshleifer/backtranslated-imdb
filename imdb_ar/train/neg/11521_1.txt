This movie is really one of the worst pieces of trash ever made. It's really amazing that something terrible is being done. But, if you can bear the mind plot, personality development, and direction, you may get a kick from the horrible soundtrack so much that it's funny. The film begins terribly and soon becomes inaccessible. A person who is involved in this film should be given some consolation because his career may be devastating because of his involvement in this film. If you end up watching this movie or seeing it (I feel your pain), these words came too late. For anyone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it wastes two hours of your life. Then at least, you can clean up or anything while watching it.
