The memoirs of the Geisha movie were beautifully filmed, no doubt about it. The representation is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it is portrayed for the characters as they are written. <br /> <br /> However, a lot of small and large details are just _wrong_ so that bothers me a lot to be able to enjoy them fully. One of the small details that illustrates the lack of allergies is one scene (that does not spoil anything), where Mamma narrates a jigsaw puzzle at the door of Siori's house on a snowy winter day. The buzzing bell is a foreign, or a wind chime - leaving only the houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have doorbells - they opened the door and declared themselves. (You might think this is a trivial detail, but I would like to compare it to a film that was produced around America where the Christmas garland is done on the door in July and no one thinks about anything.) So do not make me start off on completely wrong hairstyles given to the Meiko and Lisha, Which is a mysterious pan-Asian / Chinese / Kung Fu nest, nothing like a real thing. I think this arrogant attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really appears in the attitudes and perceptions of people and attitudes as well. <br /> <br /> So, I think that the less you know Japanese culture and the geisha and the maiko world of Kyoto (the so-called Miyako), I assume you will enjoy it more. I honestly think that this movie could have been much better ... It's also, it's just another Hollywood version of Alien Japan.
