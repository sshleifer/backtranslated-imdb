A friend once told me that an independent film of art was running in the cinema when - at the end of the film - the audience was so angry they had to tear up the cinema. Of course, I ran my imagination, trying to recall the contents of such work. Well, now I can imagine my imagination. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong admirer of Andrei Tarkovsky and admire his work. I have come across many people who thought that Tarkovsky's movies were slow and inactive. Since opinions are the same, I found that this does not apply to the wonderful work of the late director, which is filled with beautiful meanings, compositions and complex philosophical questions. When Alexander Sokurov, who was the heir to Tarkovsky, was heard, I was excited to try his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of open-air riding across the fields, this film has nothing to do with kinship. He does not seem to have the slightest meaning, even at a completely reckless level. The cinema is supposed to be "wonderfully glamorous" free of any composite craft. There is no balance or proportion, and the exposure scale seems to run out of batteries in freezing snow. The main character is incompetent and inconclusive, they make you wonder if his father might have been alive if he had decided his opinion soon. On multiple nonlinear fashion. But there is no other story here. One must definitely engage in watching this film with a razor head if it comes out of it without anything acquired and nothing lost, because the curls will be the only possible answer to the tempo that can make a carved Targusky look like Jerry. Brockheimer photographed Charlie Chaplin in short. <br /> <br /> I will not rule out this as one of Tarkovsky Solaris, but to conclude that he is one of the Tarkovsky's heirs based on this film. - Paris Hilton will be called a successor to Aristotle. Come on guys, do not be afraid to say that. There is not a large amount of impressive words that will restore the magic of this celluloid body to life. I do not admit that I fully understand Russian culture and may not have Russian values, but I immediately took Tarkovsky's works as a magical thing, a treasure and a gift to viewers. <br /> <br /> So if Sokurov's name was not on it, and broadcast to say, Saturday Night Live, I'm sure no one "reads" all these wonderful analyzes in this wet noodle from the flick.
