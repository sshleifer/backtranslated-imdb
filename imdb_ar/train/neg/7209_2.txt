I used to be fascinated by animation at college when it was made. It was a lot of charm to "get smart". Although it had its drawbacks, it was rather fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested in seeing the movie version. That was before I saw him. Keywords I wished it never happened. <br /> <br /> In addition to being anonymous everywhere (who was on the ground even though Broderick was about to turn around?), he did not make the grade. <br /> <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked in the film; seeing a live version of the tools at work! What was missing was a story and a treat that made it funny, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was an idiotic cartoon with a very lukewarm attitude. It was fun. The animation became mysterious and FAR took it seriously. If she has a big plot seriously or becomes crazy enough to make her look like a "cartoon on the film", it might be fun. <br /> <br /> Because it exists, you do not deserve to be considered part of the Old Tool.
