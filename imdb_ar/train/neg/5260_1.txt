Usually, I have no problem with a movie or story with endings that makes you wonder about what actually happened, when it was done intentionally ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really looks like they got everything but the last 15 minutes were I realized that there were $ 5 left to finish ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend that you do not spend money on it either. If you watch it on TV, watch all but the last 15 minutes, then turn away from you and let you end in your mind. <br /> <br /> Truly, it would have been better if the film had been better if they had escaped, and come back with the federal state bill only to find that the city and the car cemetery had disappeared, and in all appearances there were not ... <br /> < > "I wish I had a lot of thumb, so I could give this movie 4 thumbs up!"
