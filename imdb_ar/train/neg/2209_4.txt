If I read my "Dinoshark" rating from SyFy, you know that I can estimate the low-budget fluctuations that these films can offer for TV. They are idiots ... they are ridiculous, but they are still enjoying "very bad, it's good". So, I still deal with guilt to admire (and recommend) the undeniable Dinoshark, I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", a SyFy Original movie about a half-headed monster man who terrorizes people on an island. With the proven SyFy Channel channel to create the features of B-movie creatures and actors including William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how can an error occur? Well, to my surprise, she actually misses the mark ... not much, but enough to make me not recommend it. why? Well, first of all, the huge monster, the horrifying hybrid with the human hammer head, takes the back seat to a group of military thugs who have really become the main villain of the film. Although the head of the hammer raises the number of the body, it (or it or anything you call it) arrives only before someone has chewed and left immediately after. The rest of the film is stuffing, pitting our heroes against the soldiers above. This, for me, is not convincing like watching walking hammer eat people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
