We went to this movie because my husband was enjoying the original version of My Favorite Mars. We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave the movie in the middle of the road which is good with her parents! The parts we saw were sometimes humorous, mostly either too silly or gross. I expect this movie might appeal to children between 9-12, if that. Definitely not suitable for younger children. I heard that the original series was pretty much superior, and if you're going to get back the past, you're probably going to miss me.
