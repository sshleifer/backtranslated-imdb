Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of itself. This fantasy-style series is designed to "walk with dinosaurs". Although this 100% fantasy is presented in the same realistic and archaeological way. So mix the Fantasy Dragon with the Rex T and the Dinosaur extinction. In addition to being shown on an educational channel rather than transmitting science fiction, it gives an air of realism to the show. <br /> <br /> The show itself is 7.5 / 10 as far as entertainment goes. But the way I gave it I should give it 1/10. Do not get me wrong, I have no problem with fiction, but the way they put it is very wrong. I can really see small children and slow adults who think they have found a dragon and that this is true. <br /> <br /> I also think this weakens the "Walking with the Dinosaurs" series because you now have to watch it with the mind how much imagination is on that mini-series.
