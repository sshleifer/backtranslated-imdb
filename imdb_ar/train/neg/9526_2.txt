Going back when I was renting videos for free, I picked up this video. Oops, the things I wanted to mention outside of the abstract already submitted are these. 1: I had someone who had a great relationship by making this film a strange and sickly charm, it was terrible and unnecessary. 2: There's a kind of soundtrack in the background of the movie that seems to exist all the time, and by the way I felt for several days after watching this trash, I think they have something tentative going on in the track. Either this or it was just a painful shock or both. Often throughout the film you can tell the writer and director he did not have much experience or talent. Do not even ask about acting.
