This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While there are good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most exciting thing about this film is music, which sums up the film largely: compensation for a bad and confusing story by having well-known actors and high-sounding music and a play. It does not change the truth, that this film is very boring to watch. He earned himself a score of 1.
