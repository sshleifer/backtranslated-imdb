Bollywood fans are sponsored by Amitabh Bachchan Mard, but I think it's too much. Manmohan Desai has collaborated in films like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar, Anthony Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie. I have seen them all and I was so impressed by them that I had very high expectations before watching Mard and very disappointed. My main feeling about Mard is that it looks like the second part Amar Akbar Anthony, Mr. Desai may have run out of ideas, after all he has been using this formula for years and years. 1. First and foremost the members of the team are repeated from the AAA, for example the police inspector who establishes Ammar and the Muslim who is the largest and Niruba Roy and others. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy lost her sight, and in Mard she lost her voice 3. In AAA, there is a famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) in Mard well, our Amitabh sings Maa Sherawali. After seeing AAA for more than 1000 times, I noticed it immediately. <br /> <br /> My other fists are that some positions look silly, Manmohan Desai made your real mind on the door of the movies but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last gripe is that compared to the songs in the previous Manmohan Desai films, the songs found somewhat disappointing. I know there are many fans who swore to them but I did not like one thing. In fact, it pains me to write this review because I am very impressed and I love his films since I was young.
