When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled, in the form of shovels. <br /> <br /> From my side, Billy was a very monolithic crystal figure and did very little for the film. Sure, he broke some good jokes, but as a character who did nothing but fill the space. <br /> <br /> The poor Julia Roberts. In previous performances she played the role of a strong and determined lady. In this case, it seems to have been completely suppressed and had little fire. This is not Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching. <br /> <br /> Well, if I find something good, Christopher must be. Now this is entertainment. But, just like Billy Crystal, hardly anything appears in his personality. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of reckless laughter with very little value for a refund, look for it. But if you're looking for a smart romantic comedy, this is not your film. None of the above.
