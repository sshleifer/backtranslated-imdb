A young boy sees his mother being killed while his father is hanging. After 20 years, he got a group of friends together to evict evil spirits on himself so as not to turn like his father. All stock characters in place: nice couple. The "funny" guy hood is hard (but sensitive); smart girl (wears glasses - so we know); nerd and two blondes are not personal. All this involves some stupid wooden statue that comes into life (do not ask) and kills people. You know I'm in trouble when you jump 20 years after a big opening scene - all the bad horror movies do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, the representation is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - Why Betsey?) and the stupid and / or fictional murders. My favorite scene is when two sex people are supposed to bust the man on the bed to show that he is fully dressed! Horror, Netherworld. Avoid at all costs.
