Please do not waste +/- two hours of your life watching this movie - just no. Especially if someone is lucky to have a nap next to you. The curse of the cheek if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - it never happened. I'm not one of those people who stop watching a part of the film. I must always see it to the end. What a big mistake. Go ahead and go and draw a wall and watch it dry - much funnier. Please do not waste +/- two hours of your life watching this movie - just no.
