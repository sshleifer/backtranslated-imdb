Lewis Weber, the evangelist who has announced himself through cinema, has written and produced other films about controversial topics, but this may be the first to get a great view with TCM. This film is her condemnation of abortion, but it cleverly deforms the problem by bringing birth control and birth control, leaving the impression that it is equivalent to abortion in one way or another. Her talent for writing and other filmmaking skills is well presented here, but one may be tolerated because of her less-used wishes. If you are wondering about the format of Tyrone Power, the "famous father" of the son, this is your chance. 1916 Fashions and cars are also on screen to add to the attention of this museum piece. It's fun even if you can not afford publicity.
