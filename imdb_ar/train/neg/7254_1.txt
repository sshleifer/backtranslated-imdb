Whoever co-wrote two or three glowing reviews was either involved in making this film, or loosely used term, or circulated it to the bank, and if so, I would like to refund seven dollars! Actors, once again used the loose term, are horrendous, in fact none of them have ever done anything ever again which is a relief thing. The scene and everything about this yelling, we had $ 7 to work with and one day to do. Was this filmed in someone in the backyard? All about the project says, low budget. The actors at best were d. Do not waste your time, unless of course you want to recover it and try to recover the rent. It seems that the bad guy in the foreground looks like a punk from the seventies ended up marrying his grandmother doll Moore. My local video store lists this film pioneer as the most sought after with a sad comment. Even with a rent of 99 cents, this dust collects. Someone must really owe some favors. This is super stinky and I give it 10 turds.
