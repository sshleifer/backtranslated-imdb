I saw the 10 pm show and I must say that this movie was something special. Although I did not leave the theater and wanted to go back to my time (because I no longer pay for the movies anymore), I did not find any value for the refund. <br /> <br /> I'm a chuckle, but the film seems to consist mostly of the infatuated fan service of young people (more old than the male audience). The fan service seemed out of place and also distracted. I know you all want to hear Samuel's. He says his infamous plan, but let's be honest, it's a great bunch of hype for very little pay. The only really terrible part in the film was the CG, which looked very digitally and did not fit well with the live event on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable man, I knew I was going to the theater that I would not watch "Casablanka", and I am at least grateful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not a reproduction or privilege. But honestly, if you are not part of the following worship, it is better to spend your money elsewhere and watch the movie either in a second theater in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
