The secret is great, but the movie goes down the hill from there. The beginning is preached with the wreckage of a car and a woman and her daughter are burned alive in front of the police officer Edward. He was traumatized and the birth control pill was seen. A mysterious letter from an old friend asks for help finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to the island municipality mainly a woman. Do not like strangers. Much of the padding is with Ed which shows around town for the girl. Making the film long finally gets a bit better at the end when we learn about the mad rites performed by the woman and finally about the evil plan stored for Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a well written and very long story. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: I would like to skip this.
