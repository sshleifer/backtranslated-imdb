Boy girl loves an affair / sequel with songs, this time only the punkit is a straight arrow. Movie buffs there really is such a movie? Have fans? I have to say, that mind rollers ... "Grease 2" is a really lame institution that does not even have the courage, or moxy, or sheer gall to redeem its predecessor's memory in flames (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it beats the slow motion and often plays the role of the dead. It looks and looks cheap, with a big team losing amid an chaotic and unfocused approach. This was the first time that a large audience had been given a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she did not embarrass herself, it was a memorable role. Died at the lowest levels. No stars from ****
