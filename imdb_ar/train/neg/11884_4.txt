The biggest joke in the world. The world's biggest joke and the most outstanding in the world. <br /> <br /> Simulating this nonsense and "every man" of office space, this movie leads the attraction of this film to the ground by making humor so that it is only a true appreciation by the legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to take on the unusual role of the legal secretary, then sympathy for the stupid protagonist. <br /> <br /> The entire film is centered on the legal secretary who finds free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are his goals. You can not imagine a slap on her face to the public when they discover that (almost halfway) he had a job that fits all three criteria, but then gives it UP! The director and scriptwriter (Jacob Cornbluth and Josh Cornbluth) completely remove the public's motives by sympathizing with or even entertaining the protagonist who has already cast what he was complaining about not being there. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, it is a major stumbling block, because the humor of the legal secretary fails from within because it must be clearly explained to the public every time it happens. Without these side effects, the audience did not notice anything particularly strange. Humor can only be effective if you do not need to explain to the audience what is funny.
