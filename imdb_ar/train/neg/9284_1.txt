Man, even plan 9 of outer space better than this film. This click does not contain enough plot for half an hour, but has been able to extend it forever for over an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in overbearing combat scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk are much better than this unfortunate thing that is best left out of business.
