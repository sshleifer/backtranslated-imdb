Eddie Murphy "Delerious" is completely rude and copper ore and man. This is really the only way to describe the piece of horrific situations and sedition. Eddie Murphy goes to the value of the shock instead of laughing to try to win the follow-up. He manages to be funny from time to time, but he often loses the plot in obscene language and nasty sexual jokes. Unless you enjoy the wrong Eddie style. I do not think I'll bother Eddie Murphy Rowe. I am much better than Eddie in the movie scenario. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
