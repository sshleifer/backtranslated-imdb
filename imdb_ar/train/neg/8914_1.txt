Twenty minutes later, I had to stop watching this movie because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawn, not to mention that I was close to crying over the $ 3.99 I spent in Blockbuster. Representing Joanna Bacula and her savage Slavic spirit horribly enough to set one to string his teeth. I knew that two of them would be two hours too long. Both Pryor and Nietzsche play great actors with a few amazing talents. While we are on the subject of talent, it seems that the tiny Brewer assistant has been withdrawn from the local acting band. She obviously did not learn her craft. In fact, it's really very bad. All the public scenes seemed to be in stages, as the additions were mechanically at their best on Sunday. This movie was turned off by the play. Do not rent this terrible movie. You will be sorry that you spent your money.
