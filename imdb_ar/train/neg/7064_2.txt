"John Hughes's son wrote high school drama! Wow!" I thought when I checked the click information here on IMDb, late on Saturday night, after I found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it, and unfortunately it was sloping from there on. You can say that you can not spoil a film with such poverty, but I will leave the spoilers out of this review ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of elegance on a very little article: Unfortunately, the style has not been well dated in eight years since Issued. For the content, the film tries to take an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under the bright crust, no meaningful or related argument has ever materialized. The characters were drawn in broad childish strokes, falling into the kind of general stereotypes that the writer's father sought to put up at the breakfast club. <br /> <br /> The director Kyle Cooper is doing decent work to keep his pace (probably relying heavily on the montage of information, which quickly becomes an arduous tool, but at least drives the story forward), but his efforts do not detract enough from The weak writing and the strange casting (how anyone should be biased to Maddox, when Blake Shields blows and slips his way through the part, I can not understand), not to mention the many gap holes holes (I am all for a creative license, but when he knows The "bad guys" are the identities of "good people" who make their lives miserable, but they fail to act in any way to prevent them. You wonder why this script did not undergo a few other pre-production reworkings - did Dad read them?). <br /> <br /> I am sure that the younger audience may get some fun out of this movie (and all the power for them), but it is really better to stick to the Hughes High School's output, and if the idea of ​​rebellion in school is really a call 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfactory study of the subject.
