This film can not decide what it wants to be. There were two sub plots that make you think these elements will eventually be gathered ... but they did not. If you want a "strange story in frozen waste," commit the 1950s of the "thing" (not the hate that has been redesigned in seeing more than 20 years later). <br /> <br /> I could not get the fact that the "alien" seemed to be largely recycled from Independence Day. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" groups were more effective if they hired actors who could actually tolerate and tolerate the intended mood. <br /> <br /> Lots of chewing scene with little to no.
