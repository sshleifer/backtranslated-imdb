With an address like this, you do not know that you expect a great horror film. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. This plot is insulting and really stupid: the fugitive is wearing a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. This joke may actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the entire movie! The actors are not so bad, but their characters are rather stupid, and the story is completely boring and stupid. No suspense, no excitement and a little bit of humor (very cheap). The little devil tries to combine the horror (...) with the comedy and fails dramatically in it. It was so boring to the end that I stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I could not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great in the fantasy heart game, but come on, it was 13 years ago, and she did not do anything good after that. So no wonder she had to drown in such a piece of nonsense .. Avoid or be warned ..
