First sight 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): A scary, but sadistic (one logical) photograph of a relative of Marquez de Sade performing the same sadistic acts that his predecessor is supposed to do. The film Tobe Hooper really does not differ much from his films Freddy Krueger in style with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) plays a double role (Marquez de Sade and his relatives). He also seems to want to make fun of Christianity really, but it eventually loses so much to my grief but left my feeling asymmetrical with the film. It could have been much worse if the excesses were dealt with in sex and violence, but they try to keep this minimum despite some disgusting scenes. My last idea is why Huber wants to produce this film. It is clear that it took some time to be distributed, and then it must be declared ugly and in the name of Hubert in the title to earn some money on his name and his fortune. Obviously this did not work.
