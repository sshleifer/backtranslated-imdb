I can not believe I'm wasting my time with this movie. I could not even name it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I like movies with low budgets and exotic expenses, but this film made me bored to death. Bad made and bad behavior destroyed by the strange. You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this film. I wonder what I was thinking of watching it to the end. I recommend this movie to no one. How did they launch this? Was there an audience that liked this kind of movies? There must be because you can find this in almost any video store. but why? <br /> <br /> Worth to forget. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, it works for you.
