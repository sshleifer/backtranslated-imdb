- Let me begin by saying that I understood that the invasion of astral creatures was meant to be a parody of science fiction films in the 1950s. I understand that none of that is taken seriously. My problem is that none of them work. Parody should be funny and this is not so. Not once during the entire runtime did I do as much as breaking a smile. In general, I'm comfortable, but I could not find a slice of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble from the start. The stars appear on their screen with one of the biggest imaginable masks - an uncontrollable water hose that makes them both wet. These are the fruits of what Baurie Boys intends. Why would anyone want to mimic the action and character of Bowery Boys beyond me. After a less than brilliant start, the films continue to show comic chase sequences, Indian dances, vegetables, decoding rings, and various other erroneous bits. It's just a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I purchased this on a DVD dual feature with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This film is an Academy Award-winning compared to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
