Tourists travel to Ireland on a school trip to learn about Druids. What they face is a shocking story of cannibal killers. <br /> <br /> If you have to sum up Evil Breed, it will be a low-level gor festival. The movie mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead and Wrong Turn all in one. It is very bad that the film contains so many contradictions that it tracks that it loses any "fun" one can see. The film contains a lot of random stripping "horror" ... Although the film also includes four pornographic stars, yes four, so there was a lot. The breed also displays a great deal of gore. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a startling start, with a laughable dialogue and terrible representation. This is given in the film Direct Horror, but this takes the cake. I can not really know who is the main character, because the only female who "lives" in the end is not in the film very much. When talking about the end, it must be one of the most random and false events in the film's history. Has no purpose with the rest of the film and completely changes his view of the film. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie for its own sake, because there are some great scenes of death. There are two scenes of death that come to my mind, one of which spoils the intestinal killer intestines of a naked woman through her chest .... Yes her chest, do not ask me. The other identity when the man gets his intestines, and again, is separated by his asshole. Is the man killed? No, the killer continues to strangle the man with his bowels. These scenes remind me of many dead, with a great deal of humor in each. I also felt the sense of "dead evil", with meaningless reference to horror films and Sammy Reemi. Along with Halloween, when the female character in the closet scream for her life with a desperate murderer attempt; y; to enter. <br /> <br /> Although juggling and nudity are not enough for the audio and visual impairment of the film's quality. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks on the stairs, her steps are so high and hard that she looks like she is wearing shoes. Really distracting. As well as continuity in the film, with only one fungal killer? As well as the character who dies at that moment. I could not tell if a chick breast implant is a Jenny or a sister / cousin Gary ... I can not remember that. In addition to the random naked chick with a dead girl hanging from her body, and still connected to the secret wire. <br /> <br /> The terrible editing also distracts you, the opening credits are too fast and confusing. It was a bad start and improved, but the end brought the film back to a terrible level. If there were perhaps better production values ​​and more faith in this film, it would not be terribly slaughtered to death. Stay away from this movie, unless you are satisfied with the terrible bad budget movie below with a great idea.
