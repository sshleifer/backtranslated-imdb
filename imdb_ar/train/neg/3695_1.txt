Not the best in actors' films. The director focused on the star of the projected actor instead of giving a good artist. He may be a hero himself, his family and loyal admirers can enjoy. But it is certainly not worth the neutral audience. The sequence of fighting is a complete comedy. The movements in the strings are pathetic. The music is medium, and this film was the greatest flipping of the actor. Despite the noise that was generated on the film, the film failed miserably. Do not think about watching this step even if you want to kill time. You can see some animations instead. Good movie aficionados can digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
