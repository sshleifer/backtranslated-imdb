I have never seen the 1973 version, the oldest version of the highest rating. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, acting well as usual). This film may take every five minutes to show the entire chart (I can see it being on a cocktail napkin at a gala dinner). If you can not figure out the end of this scion in the first thirty minutes, you may find this movie amusing. This, lately, is the horrible horror that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the kind of horror / mystery / excitement, unable to give the public enough credit and writing a new, clever, sexy script, making some scary music and throwing a few things to make you jump a bit The final version is then sent to the local theater. At least, he did not have a handheld camera shake syndrome.
