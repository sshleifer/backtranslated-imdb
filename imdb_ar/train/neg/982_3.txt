The real star of this funny story is glorious Technicolor. Visual treatment of the eye, failure of the film to stimulate the mind and heart. I was startled at first by the idea of ​​leaving Dietrich and Boer in debt to "find" their ability to love. The following is a great disappointment. Pu'er is the only real actor in production and a sense of torment. The amazing Dietrich wardrobe outperforms its performance - sometimes its face is scary - a homogeneous mask. As a monk, the monk's version of the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartres) - when he leaves "his marriage to God," the reaction of his fellow monks carries shock and fear that perpetuates the organized religion. The viewer feels that Pu'er is well disposed of his past. However, the next trip is very predictable.
