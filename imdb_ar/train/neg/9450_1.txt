Spend your time any other way, even a better home business than this movie. Jokes are not funny, and the funniest rules that Dr. Suss does not exist. Very poor way to waste an evening. My kids aged 4 to 16 laughed a bit at first, the young children felt bored by it and left them to play barbez and older people to play PS2 and surf the internet. My wife left and did the dishes. So I just finished it. It was the worst movie "kids" I've ever seen. If you want to watch a fun movie for children, watch Shrek 2, this movie is fun for kids and their parents. Avoid this movie. It's not funny, not nice, the cat's makeup revolves around the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disc sticker.
