Last weekend, I bought this "zombie movie" from the deal box and watched it with some friends who thought it would be a budget version of "The Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems as if they have spent a good part of their budget on the art of coverage, which is very misleading for lovers of this kind of zombie. <br /> <br /> We've been watching to point out where the zombie chicks go and get into the car with some people outside who are not talking about any business on the cell phone. They actually talk to the man before a girl kills him; but once they start driving, I can no longer comment on my non-ratification. <br /> <br /> Some people consider this movie "very bad, it's good", they're liars. I did not finish the film, but one of the other reviews reported that they actually become police officers at the end of the film, making me happy because I did not watch it all the time. <br /> <br /> This is worse than "Zombiez" you do not see!
