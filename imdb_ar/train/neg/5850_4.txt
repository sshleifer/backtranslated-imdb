Neil Shipman tried a plot to end the hunt for "back to God's country" the previous year, and failed miserably. This time, it is better, although it seems meaningless. "Something new" barely has a plot located outside the chase. There is a brief hypothesis, putting the hero (co-author and friend of Sheppman) to have to save the girl (played by Sheppman), then it is just an exciting and unreasonable chase from there. Of course, it is shown as an hourly advertisement for Maxwell Sedan, but the whole film is ridiculous. She does not seem to have learned much from last-minute rescue movies from DW. Griffiths or the parody of Mack Sennett and other comedian actors. <br /> <br /> Among the interesting points is that Shipman writes and directs herself to the film as the storyteller of the film, which included her protagonist. Writer (Shipman again), although she does not do anything smart or funny, although she tries it. Again, the others were pioneers in the writer's joke of overlap, such as Anita Los with Wild and Woolly or Frances Marion with "A Girl's Folly" (both 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that she does not take herself seriously or seriously - and does not first break through "something new" despite her claim.
