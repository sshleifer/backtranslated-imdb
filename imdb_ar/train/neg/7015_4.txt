"54" is a movie based on the infamous Studio 54 in the 1970s - the resting place for social elite and party clubs. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that everything is brilliant and style and not guaranteed. He tries to have a grim spelling and is already discovered as "Boogie Nights", but eventually he appears as a man who is wishing. Mike Myers was assigned an unknown task of playing Steve Robel, owner of the cocaine club. It's a little comedic, and if this is Myers' best attempt to slip into drama like Lemmon and other comedians of their time, it would be a total failure. <br /> <br /> It was possible that the "54" insightful was interesting but instead is just a mute teen flick that is not amusing or even remotely appealing. View at your own risk.
