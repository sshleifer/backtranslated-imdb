Without repeating what was said above about this film, I would add that I was looking forward to watching this movie ... The actors / location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc ... He had a mysterious shadow of "Do not Look Now" about the story from the start. Staying in a different environment (Italy again) to ease the heartbreak of loss ... Or maybe that's what I saw? So I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and take a look at what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .... I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? Nothing really happens! I do not mean anything !! So you did not give the opportunity to enter the characters because they are dimensions and void .. You lead to the belief of the pace of the film that something will happen to turn the entire film on his head ... Spirits the older girls with the local boys of Vespa, and had a great room to take the film in the direction Another, the younger girls' visions of her dead mother were a useless exercise, and the parents were trying to lure one of his students. I was ridiculed by his age. It seemed as if the script had a last call, where they decided at the last minute to eliminate any courage of the story and went to minimize it without any effect. When credits started circulating (unexpectedly), you could only feel robbed by your time spent sitting watching this pile of garbage.
