This was awful, the plot was fine, but the rest was bad. I mean come on the dolls and they even tried making a digital film and that made it worse! I usually wanted to get a low budget film, but it was just a waste of time and almost made me want to get back the group that appeared on it. I have about 10 films with a low budget of 6 to 8 films and I would say that this is the worst film. The wording is also extinguished and they use fake plastic spoons that do not look like real, but they can use those that look very close to one real one so save your time and money and do not see this scary movie.
