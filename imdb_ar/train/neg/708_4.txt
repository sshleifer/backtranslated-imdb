The story and the presentation were good, but it was really frustrating and I hated the frustrating films. Palestine is wonderful. He has performed really well, and the girl who played his sister was wonderful and really wonderful. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galligar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Ann Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles records, but I'm glad I watched the movie before reading the book. This is a "real" too little for me. I prefer Lustat and Lewis to small conspicuous fights of slave struggles. Hertha Kate was very creepy, and after she did her character what I did, the film ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (Sorry for the mystery, but I do not want to give up anything) Sorry, but not just my display type.
