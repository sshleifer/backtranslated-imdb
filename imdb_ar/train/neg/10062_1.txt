Nintendo !!! You are #% $ @ ERS! How can you do this to me? I can not believe it ... This film is actually worse than I. I went to see this in the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to mark .... oh God ... where do I start? The plot sucked. Voice Acting sucked. The cartoon is cocky. The end really sucked. If you liked this movie, you suck. And to Futuramafan1987, who said that this was the greatest film ever, you are an easy and simple tool. This is not a movie for anyone other than 10 year old children with Game Boys who think that Pikachu is God. I still cry to this day thinking about that terrible horror of the film .... then there was a picchu adventure ... Do not make me start in this terrible mess of a movie. It is, in fact, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Do not go to see this at all costs. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Get out, find every copy of this movie you can, and burn it. Burn them all, then continue to rent a good movie, like aliens ... or bowling to Columbine ... or even back to the future!
