"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who pass the body of Dracula. When a mysterious stranger shows up and offers the students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal his blood for the auction, it's an offer they can hardly refuse. Soon the students will also find themselves relentlessly vampire murderer of the Vatican! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a fun little horror movie that contains many flaws. The characters are one-dimensional and the representation is fairly average. They are some good influences like the really impressive double headdress scene, but there is not enough violence to appeal to me. The film becomes boring and fast forgotten and there is no comment at all. So, if you like the modern vampire, give it a look. Vampire coolers in the atmosphere from the 1960s and early 1970s such as "Blood lips", "Dracula brides" or "Limora: supernatural child story" to name a few.
