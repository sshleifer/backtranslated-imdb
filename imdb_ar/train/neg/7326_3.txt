This film has an interesting plot, but the acting is very bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma facing the main character is an interesting one, but because of poor writing and the making of this hypothesis is likely to be a stolen winner. Two of the other four people left the theater after about 45 minutes while others laughed at how bad the film was. I stuck it out to the end, but I must admit I played the blackjack game on my cell phone to make another 30 minutes possible.
