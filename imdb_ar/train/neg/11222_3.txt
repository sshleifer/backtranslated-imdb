Sybil Richards directs another masterpiece of Full Moon movies / Surrender of Eroticism. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (who was dressed in silver instead) was commissioned to destroy all sexual evidence. However, she can not resist watching the tapes she likes. The sex scenes were filmed well and set on a great soundtrack (at least for this kind of film). The cast is pretty awful, looking basically very very average. Jacqueline Lovell is herself an exceptionally attractive and watching sex files run by her to expose her chest and touch a bit below her. It also fits in a little lesbian activity. To be honest Lovell deserves much better than this kind of fare. Looks wonderful here but is actually more attractive in her silver dress that tells "drama". Completely rubbish film with Lovell and soundtrack are the only real features of the recovery. Even average for Surrender production is obviously a new budget low for them as well.
