Although it is a supplement to the most powerful original version, this is more of a remake on Friday 13th with regard to the more exotic of Angela the Sicopath, killing more teenagers fit for marriage because of "debauchery" in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks fantastic. There are some ridiculous sex scenes darn with some pretty attractive girls, but the film is comedically (unintentionally) comic rather than disgusting, it's stinky. <br /> <br /> * Out of ****. <br /> <br /> MPAA: G rated R for graphic violence, nudity, sexual violence, language and drug abuse.
