If that guy manages to make a movie, I'm sure hell can make it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you're hiring me to make a movie for you, I promise you:> <br /> 1) I'll add more naked women. This film was nothing. I think the stunning B-type horror films are rented only because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I do not want to give up my viewers. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from making many scenes where the hero wakes up to discover that it is just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. Given that the film was just a long hour, the length of the film was pretty much. If I decide to do the dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not get rid of any movies like Star Wars or Matrix because I know my budget is small and I do not want to hide my disdain for big budget Hollywood movies by adding sarcastic references in my country. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can be very scary ... at least they turned it into a nasty thin monster before the screen burst or anything. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for qualities in the next horror movie, count on me: I want to make a great movie.
