Leap Years plays the role of some serious players in the local and regional film and television scene. However, they can not save this movie. It has a lot of things that contradict it - over representation, overly melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent trend; there are very few things going on - decent music, good cinema. This comment is mainly for anyone who puts all the local movies in one basket after watching this movie and says that all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this single film. This is a television series soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film. My hopes were great when I bought my ticket and my hopes faded five minutes after the film.
