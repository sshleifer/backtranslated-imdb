In the sixth grade, each teacher decided it would be good to make the film a full-semester curriculum. Each category had a relationship with this terrible show. We saw it in English and wrote in the newspapers as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about charts and other sea crap. In the science we talked about whales (which were actually rather interesting, so it was not a 100% waste of time). Every day was torture. Not only that, but they will subject us to this horror twice a day by making us see it in the classroom too. I can see whether this is a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to prevent this.
