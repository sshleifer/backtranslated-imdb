With the knowledge of Enki Bilal comics for some time, I had to see this film. I thought this would be a good way for the artist to have Bilal spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought this would be a good film I recommend, and I think I'll enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves much to be desired, and basically, everyone who sees this film has the impression that it can do it better. I will not make a suggestion as to whether you should watch this movie or not. Chances are if you read those pages you've already seen, or you'll see them - but be prepared for 102 minutes too bad.
