This film is inexplicably bad. Starts with many random explosions and then cuts into a sock puppet of T-Rex talking (!) To the audience. She moves between stockings and animations all the time, perhaps because the filmmakers could not afford the direct actors. I will provide you with this long, fun-filled plot that continues this miserable film for 85 brutal minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby store somewhere where he sold a film to B, and bought it for the sole purpose of ridiculing it, but, as it turned out, our intervention was not necessary. This film makes fun of itself better than we can. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Outer Space 9 Plan" was the most popular film ever to exist, but left it to Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock dollets. If you watch this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and deserves a lot of good laughs.
