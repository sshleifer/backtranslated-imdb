It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazzara and Audrey Hepburn. It looks very wonderful. But that was it. They have not been given any good characters or lines to work with. I did not understand and did not care what the characters were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were fine, and Patty Henson and Colin Camp were efficient and confident in their small, small parts. They have shown some talent and sadly they have not continued to represent more and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think Dorothy Strethin got a chance to do her only important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans, and I was very open when I started watching it. I am a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and have enjoyed his latest films "Cat's Meow" and all his early films from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So, it really surprised me that I barely managed to keep watching this vigilant. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film is about a detective agency where investigators and clients cooperate with each other emotionally. Five years later, his former girlfriend Bogdanovic, Sibel Shepard, had won a successful television series entitled "Moonlighting" to steal the idea of ​​the story from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was based on a lot of smart dialogues, while this tries to be related to the cheeky and a few spiral lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is not "Paper Moon" and a very dim version of "What's Up, Doc".
