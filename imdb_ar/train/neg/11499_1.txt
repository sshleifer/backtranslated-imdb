Gadar is really stupid because he tells a fake story. It's a very unrealistic film, a typical sunny diol aimed at striking Pakistan. The aim of the film is to mislead viewers so they can believe that Pakistan and the government are bad but will not succeed in trying to hide their flaws. All the songs and music in the movie are all bad. Most likely the Sikh will love the film because they are misled. Absorbs the film and absorbs it strongly. I think Amisha Patil was good at the film. If I could give 0 out of 10, only I would be less than 1.Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie .Disaster.
