Of course, only the Jessica Simpson movie could have included such serious laps. I'm Norwegian and I felt insulted and shocked that the makers of this film did not take the time to do that research on making this American / "Norwegian". Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I'm posting my corrections from my disappointment: - The country is named Norway, not Norway. - "D" is Russian, not Norwegian. - The Norwegian priests never use those blackheads with that white card from the neck because the Protestant Church is largely dominant - we have a traditional, indigenous community (we only use them twice a year), but the outfit in this film is like German costume. - I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this film .. Jessica was not logical .. Niger did "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing he realized was the Norwegian flag (and the Viking hats, but this Stereotypes are what people think about Norway - Viking !: Oh God) <br /> <br /> Well, I think the people who made this film will never read this comment. But at least I have cleared some things and got rid of some of this frustration ..! <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and I love if people in the United States are less typical and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was all .. Lenge leve Norge! ;
