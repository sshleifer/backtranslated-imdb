I love killer insect films, it's very fun to watch, and I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books for Shawn Hotson. <br /> <br /> I met him and I hope to hear that the film was awesome as he said, after he said I was still dying to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Plot: People die in mysterious and ugly circumstances, and no one has a clue what reason? <br /> <br /> Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of deadly mollusks laughs from the authorities. <br /> <br /> Just as the body count begins to rise and an expert from England begins to snoop, does he start appearing as if Mike has the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most watched movie in the movie! The molluscs in this quick (and then normal) movie seem to redirect the viewer quickly! <br /> <br /> This film is not like the book at all, it was more frightening and ten times the book and has many other story! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! As I am a big fan of molluscs book and second book called Raising the Earth! Both books are fantastic <br /> <br /> Read the book and then watch the movie, you may want more then this was given 2 out of 10
