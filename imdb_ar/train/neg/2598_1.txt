Even in a bad movie, there is usually a recovery feature, something you can say yes was terrible, but there was this performance, or that part of the script, or this special effect, that was just awful everywhere. The acting was laughable, the script bad, filled with many inexplicable breakfasts at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were poor at best. This was a very bad film, and it was even deleted through the wishes of Drew Barrymore of history. Watch it if you want to: a) suffer from severe pain. B) See how bad the film can be. This is one film where I use cliches "There are ninety minutes of my life and I will never go back" with some justification!
