The directors' intentions in these films are very honorable, but his history in his productions has made me realize that this may not be as great as other filmmakers want. Taking into account his impressive 30-day TV series, but also in his MTV production "I bet you will" oppose the seriousness of any of the things he documents and also in his rather disappointing production "replaces me" with high hopes. Unfortunately this movie disappointed me less. As with "replace me" after a while I ask myself exactly what was the purpose of all this. The main statement becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the play time is filled with somewhat meaningless things and a replay of the things already presented in this way or earlier in the film, so they fade away and become very boring towards the end.
