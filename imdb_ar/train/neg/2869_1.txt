The story is like this, Netflix was late to send my DVDs so I moved to the analog rental place known as "Blockbuster Video". Very bad, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure but I do not want to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer out there on the shelf, all on its own. I love watching movies based on serial killers. It is just a part of humanity I will never understand, so I want to see this kind of thing. Anyway I put this DVD and suddenly since the first second, sucks. I'm sitting there with my own and we like, "What's that kind of crap?" The unstable camera process, the terrible representation, - the first scene in which a woman is killed wondering if she prefers to calm down instead quietly, and then the rats crammed into her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard time on this crap. There is nothing decent about this "film". All I want to say to the director is "Do you have an eccentric tripod?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was awful. It was as if they had once decided to make a film. They may have gathered people from Wal-Mart to show them "and act" in their favor. Just plain awful. If you make a movie like this, steering is your hobby - not what you should do for a living - you do not have to go to the kidneys of a DVD to find movie buffs like me. It's best to leave it at home to your friends when a party is held and take advantage of interesting things to entertain with them. Then you discover BTK KIller and say: "Do you want to watch this crazy movie that you did once?"
