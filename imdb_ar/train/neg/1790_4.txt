This film was "attractive" at first, then got very modest and distinct songs, at best. <br /> <br /> There are many words spoken by King James, which are not only disturbing in today's world but not always easy to explain. Can you imagine young people today trying to listen to this film? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good fonts here and it's loved like "Hank Martin". Ronda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") also, in addition to its beautiful appearance and long long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with a happy ending, and I can not touch it. Maybe this is worth leasing, for historical history or if you love the great Crosby but, overall, this is not much.
