How to ridicule the book, to flirt with it. I may be an American citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans scratching each other on the back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I was amazed that few of them had commented on the importance of the language of emotional and emotional writing and dialogue in this film. The historical inaccuracy of the film is not as massive and humiliating as in "U-571" (which turns British submarines into American divers) but you still walk away from your sense of vanity. Really, the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans among the battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I would just like to tell the book: It is clear to many of us that you can not capture real people, suffering from real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken some shortcuts that have been well tested. You are always lucky that there will always be small nationalists who appreciate your sugar-coated intestines.
