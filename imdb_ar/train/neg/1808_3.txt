In his 1996 film "The Bomb", Antonioni was the hero of the truth for the young British protestors. By asking such questions against a fabric of Hippie youth movements, Anthony deliberately questioned whether or not they were involved in the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for an issue when what you think is a real lie? On the other hand, the film said that we have to fight and see an active challenge to what we see precisely because others may deceive us with false images and false facts. Although the Hippie aspects were the most attractive parts of Blow Up, they created a beautiful texture and gave the film a bigger meaning than it could have had. It was a very small, warning and mature film. <br /> <br /> With the movie "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni throws all the ambiguities in "Blow Up" and goes to the Hippie completely. The result is a film steeped in bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy storytelling. How can someone, throughout his self-discipline and intelligence, show that he makes something so ridiculous? <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a wonderful series of close friends, while we watch a group of extremists discussing the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly one man (Mark) wakes up and leaves. He hates the strict and organized nature of the revolution. He understands that, although the rebels are fighting for freedom, linking itself to such an armed cause is to give your freedom effectively. Like Jack Nicholson in The Passenger, Mark wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a weapon and goes solo. Takes orders from no one. When the police raided the university campus Mark shoots the man and runs away. Then flee to a nearby airport and steal a small private plane and fly to the desert. Antony treats the desert as a peaceful and peaceful city, contrasting it with the unforgiving capitalist cities, with their modern paintings and hollow machines. He sees the desert as a kind of Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark met Badria and soon fell in love. Antonioni gives us an ironic scene where hundreds of hippies practice sex in the sand. Free from the limitations of modern life, tree enthusiasts and student radicals can now celebrate their individuality by manipulating the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the death of Mark and Daria, who imagined the bombing of the palaces and the grandeur of the homes of wealthy capitalists who killed him. It is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Pick up weapons, guns and explosives, he says. Demolish the walls before they lock you! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film had no impact on its audience. They realized that "Zabriskie Point" is just a self-centered business attempt to be radical. A kind of commodity radicalism. I felt dishonest and tamed. <br /> <br /> Objectively the movie is too stupid. Antony basically says that if you are not satisfied with the modern world, and the quail cats that use you, you must either escape to the desert (Mark) or fight the regime (Daria) actively. That's all good and good. But although artists constantly warn us about such stalemate nightmares, they are often unable to show how to manage change effectively. Like the end of the "fighting club", nihilism and violence do nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be stimulated by modest inventors, driven by simple technological advances. I mean, what is the liberated woman more than contraception? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Very bad movie. The problem is that Anthony does not really believe in rebellion. He is a calm and thoughtful man. An introvert seems to have made a flat film just to get more admiration for the counter culture that adopted his previous film "Explosion". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" comes as a spoiled and stupid film. It's basically a 50-year-old man who says, "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films where the public is encouraged to fight "the regime", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the life of the freedom fighters ends in failure, even though the "spirit of revolution" remains in each case. The message is that you can not bring about change, but by death or failure, the idea of ​​optimism of change lingers through testimony. Essentially, we must continue to fail rather than give up hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", which simply encourage you to explode. Tear everything down. Blow everything up. Everything is a lie, so guns may go out flaming. These films are caused by angry reactionary feelings, rather than any kind of common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "Flight instead of fighting." Terence Malik and Anthony are masters of this genre. Films such as "The Traveler", "The Red Desert" and "Badlands" show human beings emerging from worlds they do not like and falsifying islands or safe havens for themselves. Both managers are pessimistic, as Malik has destroyed his islands and Antonioni has islands that offer no sense of happiness or resolution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films like Donnersmark in The Lives of Others, Ashby Bond for Glory, Kubrick, and Orangework treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In these fanatical worlds, where everyone is merely a slave to the state, it is the absolute creativity and free will of the artist / criminal that keeps the system under scrutiny. Simply by existing outside the herd, you can create waves. Your feedback, your actions and your critical caliber, defy the status quo. As such, Donnersmark contains novelists and artists who undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has the artist / criminal who fights the Nazi fall, paints the city with blood and sperm.
