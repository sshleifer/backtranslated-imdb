I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. On the assumption that it will be filmed more accurately such as "The Christmas Box" based on the book of Richard Paul Evans. I have sent many emails to friends and family and ask them to please watch this show, hoping to better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really knew the pain, I hoped this film would highlight parents who "believe" that they understand the grief of a parent who has lost a child. It was a very opening film, and Diane Keaton's sarcasm was a slap in the face of parents who buried a child. It was very unreal from start to finish. I received several calls after the movie, each one call, "It was so far away from the mark and made it seem like you were in a short time back to the road and heard the songs on the radio and came back to life" a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because none of them will ever make the film away from the mark. I think this is Hollywood.
