Any film in which Brooke Shields excels at Fonda will be both extraordinary and terrifying. Shields are actually only bad because they are young and inexperienced, and obviously they are not well directed by their partner in the star. Peter Fonda is bad because it is okay. I loved it at Ulee's Gold, years later, but Lord above, it's terrible here. Not that anyone else is good. There is no single performance (outside Henry Fonda's wonderful engraving) which is even acceptable. I have never seen a film that contains many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, this is clearly due to poor dialogue and direction, since he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, Ted Markland, plays embarrassing pork. The writing is just bloody awful, and the actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they say. But they tell them very badly! Liberation and direction worse than pedestrians. Snapshots are held for a long time without any exciting reason, or broken before the scene's impact is achieved. This picture was much worse than I had imagined and it could have been completely forgotten (and probably never happened) without the participation of a few famous names. One bright spot: Grand Canyon cinemas are gorgeous, capturing the beauty of this region in a way that did not even produce Imax Large screen well. And finally: Either this is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a beloved father-daughter pair, or a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more romantic relationship between forty and thirteen years old. It refers to more of the latter than the former, and therefore is very troubling.
