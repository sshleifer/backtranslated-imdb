I will be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, it is very close. I watched the soap opera teen bad. Well this is like one of these. Only what is worse. Example: Girl (maybe spoiled): I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Man: All we need is here. <br /> <br /> Girl: But I want to take myself in a different place. guy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... Follow this line to have sex. Bad music pop and bad rock punk. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like Plague. They completely change personalities of characters and events. In addition, they just get rid of things. Also, the movie ends before the book finishes. it is a wonderful movie. So, if you do not read the book, you do not see it. If you have read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like the stupid fig-less soap opera of lesser quality than the low quality fig soap, look for it. Then again, should you expect anything different from MTV?
