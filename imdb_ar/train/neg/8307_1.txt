This offer is incredible in that. . . What represents and focuses on. . . Words can not describe how ET is crazy. They will report anything. If a celebrity is indirectly related to the story, ET will report it. If a dog is in Tom Cruise Square, they will report it. If a celebrity dies. . . They will talk about it for weeks at the end of the point where the public envies celebrities. If a celebrity is under trial. . . ET will report it to MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this exhibition will offer and there is no timeframe that determines how long they will focus on the story. Are you even considered legitimate reports? The reports are very disturbing, with harsh harsh voices and an unnecessary pause to convey the sense of importance. I can not see this offer without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is one of the big reasons why I avoid pre-evening performances in general. I'm sorry that IMDb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even negatives. For this offer is worth 10 stars.
