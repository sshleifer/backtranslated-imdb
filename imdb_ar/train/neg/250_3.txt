After seeing three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me that this is the most vulnerable, mainly due to Scott's rather dull performance. His feelings throughout the very cute makes it difficult to engage in the film. Photos Alistair Sim Best Dora. When Scrooge was at best, he did not feel Scott's sense of dialogue strongly condemned, and when he undergoes his conversion, he is not similarly convinced. I can not think of any actors in this movie that match the version of Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and frankly the puppets) take on this is performed better. Very disappointing.
