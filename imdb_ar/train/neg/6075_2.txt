The Fan is one of the worst films I have ever seen with Robert De Niro, a senseless cliche for light-weight exercise. Trying to twist or twist the genre with useless plot lines for one crazy fan and turned into a psychic - the film means nothing. (Spoiler) We believe that a fool carrying a knife can access a baseball player and kill him in a luxury hotel without a witness or security or cameras? The nonsense film tries to crush our strings through a baseball ball that end up being ridiculed by ridicule and elegance. I'm not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got to this game. This is as big as dud as it comes. Stay away if you prefer to think about your movies
