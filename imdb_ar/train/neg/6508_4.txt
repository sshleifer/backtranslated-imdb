This is the rupture of the old Frankenstein hypothesis. A famous scientist killed in a strange accident and his father, a famous brain surgeon saves the brain. It is then placed in an automatic body of its own design. Gives his brother, an electric genius, a "tremendous" impetus to convey ideas to a movement. The whole project is going badly, when design becomes enormous. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script does not exist. It's funny that this is not a bit scary. Well, very young children think this is good. If you are fully awake at 3 am this comes in ... night and night. <br /> <br /> VIPs are played by Otto Krueger, John Paraghery and Ross Martin. Ed Wolf played "The Giant".
