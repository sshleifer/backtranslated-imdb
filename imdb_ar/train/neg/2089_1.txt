Of course I was watching BG. I liked S1, I liked the second season, the third season was good, and I love the final. Yay, there is a detailed presentation! I never knew that, one of my friends told me. I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of rubbish! Teen girl drama festival. There is no science fiction ... well, barely there. At the end of each episode we can take a look at the Cylon. That's all. Who cares about this? Did they decide that the target audience in the next show would be female under the age of 18? A dull religious nonsense that speaks, groans, dislikes ... and others. <br /> <br /> It is sad that there is nothing for now to see. Stargate destroyed, BG on ...
