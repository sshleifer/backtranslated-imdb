The idea of ​​"in the name of the people" is good. The murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl who killed her to look after his daughter. You can expect representatives, especially Scott Bacula to do some good work, unfortunately they do not! In The People of the People, tearjerker became the usual Friday night. Past memories with the girl you killed are very pathetic, and at some point you can only predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good movie about it, watch Dean Man Walking!
