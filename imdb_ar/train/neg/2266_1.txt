The ringmaster, Jerry Springer, is a pathetic excuse to waste a film that must be recycled after the toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of the film. First of all, it was made. Second, people went to see it. Third, some people voted the best film they ever saw. If the monkey manages to make a movie, I'm sure it will be a billion times better. Most of the crappy movies have their moments, (so that Godzilla had some great special effects) was the moment of this film when she left the theater with nausea. The only thing that might make this movie worse off is that Jerry Springer is the star. If I wanted to stare at the nonsense for an hour and a half, I would sink into a box. If no one despises this film, I'm sorry for you and your children and your children's children; however, unlike Springer's beliefs, I obviously do not condone children who have sex.
