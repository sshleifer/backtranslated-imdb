I missed this film in the cinema but I have an idea in the back of my head that it was worth watching, so when I saw it on the shelves in the DVD, I thought it was "watch time". big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, and certainly one of the worst movies ever. The plot is poorly understood and poorly presented. It may have been logical to read Robbins' novel, but unless the film is completely different from the novel, and with the help of Rubens in the script, I doubt that the novel should be a horrifying reading as well. I hope the actors have received good salaries because they seem embarrassed by the loss of celluloid and recent DVD voids, for example Pat Morita. So Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Save yourself about 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like pruning your fingernails or sorting a sock drawer. Even when you see it in the "less than $ 5" box in your local store, resist the urge!
