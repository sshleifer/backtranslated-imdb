I honestly consider this film as another poor effort in filmmaking in the Dominican Republic. The first 30 minutes of the film are a little funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men usually do) the film falls. Becoming boring and not funny at all. They have left many things unexplained and the film's end is predictable. I did not like the way when Roberto Angel played his character and also small. I went to the movie theater hoping to see a good job but I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film.
