This is the early role of Chilean Barbara (in fact, her first in Britain after working in Italy), when she was 24 years old, and it is certainly safe to say that she made a stunning appearance in "Cat Girl" in 1957. While blondes (I will always cherish Yutte Stensgaard), the beautiful dark-haired actress with deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as weakness (for example, "Village of the Damned" in 1960) whose display time was far less than a pair Her character, George Sanders). It's the only reason to see this terrible update, "Cat People", and it's seen as a big advantage all the time (it's hard to say if its beauty has found a better show). Her character seems to sleep in the open, and we are exposed to her bare back when she wakes up (she was also revealed after 8 years in 1965 in Rasputin - The Mon Monk). The film is a stunning wonder without a porter (I do not see what carried this dress, but I'm sure). All in all, positive evidence that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly written role would defeat most actresses, rises above her material and makes the film bevelled continuously, a real test of star power, which you will soon find enough in the Hummer studios in Bray, throughout 1960s.
