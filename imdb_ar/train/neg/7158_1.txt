This is some of the worst behavior I have ever seen. I love Merida Reza Club, but this is just an absolute. Apart from a few moments of cinema and interesting music, this film is just a bad material and mute effect. Jared Harris is very bad, but no one is in this good remotely. The plot is a joke, but not the kind of haha. I do not even know if you can forgive very bad movies. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadia and another girl another planet?
