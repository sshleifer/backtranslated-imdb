I saw this movie for two reasons - I love Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a very stupid film. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because he explains his disdain for all Christian things, but there was a camp so great that this idea did not materialize as much as it could have. I think this film is more than a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before he is really recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remember the audience (me and 5 other people watching this film) that he still exists. I've already enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself.
