As far as cinema goes, this film was good for the mid-1950s. There were several times that the lighting was very hot but the shots were in the frame and stayed in focus. The representation was above average for a low-budget bad smell but the direction was terrible. Many scenes were pulled too far in an attempt to thrill and the effects were absent. It was supposed to have been completely removed from the skull attack in the pond, and every attempt was made to bring life back to the skull using clear pokes and thread. I could only think that the budget did not allow them to supply the house so they continued to point to the engines and that all the stored things should come soon. Frankly ... it would be fun if it was a worse film. It was not bad enough to be a "good" film, but it was not good enough to be "good" too. Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
