Carl Jr. and his father run an army on a remote island. They catch a trio of men who stumble on the island. Who after a while fight again. (Well survivors) This casualty has blood, gore and slaughter without interruption, it was good to see any of them real remotely, or if the production does not look as if it was produced with weeks of saved lunch. The money (I may have been overpriced there ... probably just a few days worth). The terrible dubbing did not bother me much and I suspect that if I was really drunk, some of them might be a little funny ... maybe. But as is, in just 78 minutes the film still feel very long .. Oh do not know ... 78 minutes. do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Reward movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; trailers for other Shock-o-Rama movies
