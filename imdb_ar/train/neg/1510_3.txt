Reasons to watch this stopped ... I missed ... Greetings to a wonderful movie called Se7en: - It works while browsing your channel and there is nothing else. - Someone is pushing you to watch it. <br /> <br /> Give yourself the favorite feature of the Se7en DVD, rent it, download it to iTunes, place it in your Netflix signal and skip the entire Flock. Flock the same story with some changes. Moreover, editing is only about Se7en and you end up getting out of the story several times. Perhaps the worst is flying above the helicopters' helicopters, with the voices of people chattering over the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying over the area. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: I call it stark. Stop working or kill. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute movie, go ahead, but in either case, you can watch Se7en.
