If there's a worse comedy than "Gray Maters", I'm not aware of it. The ridiculous premise of Jewish comedy in New York is that the brothers Sam & Gray are wrong for the couple and so they decided to fix Sam with a girlfriend, only to find that Gray was attracted to their goal - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is nothing but a surprise to her. There is a very humiliating wedding sequence, and the very "drunken action" of Moynahan and Graham, a performance that would embarrass the woods everywhere because of the roughness of Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Speek is proving that she is not fully capable of doing comedy, and will want to upload her autobiography. Molly Shannon plays the role of family friend with painful neglect. Alan Cumming is the only one who grows up with no credit but works dangerously and works without giving anything to work with. The entire disaster was reinforced by the performance of Graham the Rolling Curly, who culminated in the penultimate scene, wearing a comic hat and a mask although the scene was in a lesbian pub. Surprisingly, this movie has ever been released, and has no recovery feature and should be avoided at all costs.
