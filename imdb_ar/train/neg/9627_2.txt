Well, I love Ben Stiller completely, although I'm chilly about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act at least. It is very difficult to skip every movie or play I saw in it. It seems to stand just there reading right off the script. The film had only one good thing: Ben Stiller was there. This plot is used and abused. How many films have this kind of plot? Can you say "the forces of nature ??" Not only is it an old conspiracy, but the result is predictable, even boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened. It was a pleasure, but watching Stiller was always a joy !!!
