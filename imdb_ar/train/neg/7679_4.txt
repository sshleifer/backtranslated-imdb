Snow White, who just came out in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see him, points of course to the world famous fairy tale. It also refers to coke. In the end, the real snow in the Swiss Alps plays its role as well. <br /> <br /> Thus, the three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There are plenty of steroids on the scene, and there is also a pale girl with dark hair - with a prince who has to go through all sorts of problems to be able to save her. <br /> <br /> But: it's not a fantasy story. It is supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the logo). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is close to perfection. Unfortunately, the weak plot, expected squares, mostly unrealistic landscapes, and mixed representations do not add up to the creation of authenticity. Thus, I was a spectator who remained spared. <br /> <br /> After that, there were cliches that drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is the daughter of the rich and corrupt upper class - of course divorced her parents did not get enough love from them, because they were very busy all the time . Her best friend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a hard worker and housewife) live in a small flat, poor and happy - and ignore the desperate situation in which their daughter lives. The good man (= prince) is a musician (!) Of the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be less economically successful but emotionally fragmented from the country). He has problems with his parents. They are immigrants from Spain who do not seem to accept their brutal way of life until the father becomes seriously ill and admires his great admiration for his son from the hospital bed. <br /> <br /> So it goes on: Of course, the brutal drug dealer, heartless bankers, the club owner is a playboy and photographer, although a woman (!), has her career only when Snow White was exposed in pornographic images Art in display. <br /> <br /> This review does not need a spoiler to be able to add these pieces to a clear outline. As I liked other movies for Samir, for example "Forget Baghdad", I was very disappointed. Let's hope the next stage.
