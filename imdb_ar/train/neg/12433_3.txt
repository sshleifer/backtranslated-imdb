I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this sums up pretty much. You can not beat the original two for several reasons, one including the talent directed by Chris Columbus. <br /> <br /> This film had a terrible output that was covered with a more horrifying representation. I can not even think that these people are considered representatives. <br /> <br /> It is painful to sit and watch. The story was a complete joke about a secret slide and the Russian terrorists in a strenuous attempt to restore it. Terrible, hire one of the original draw and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The movie was not set even during Christmas as the original. Home Alone was converted from an excellent family comedy film at Christmas time into a joke without morality or conspiracy!
