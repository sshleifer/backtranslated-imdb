This is the worst film I have ever seen. I'm not kidding. The next time that is turned on, I will constantly run my head in the wall. It would be a pleasure to sit in the emergency room trying to explain to the doctor why my brain swollen from trying to get him out of this movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope that the blacks and the weak will not work together again with such a bad project. They are both a good comedian actor, so I was shocked because this was very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If they have to do it again, I'm pretty sure they'll decide not to. People who have encountered money, must have lost a ton. Not really - because the special effects (all of them 2) were awful.
