What this stinkeroo turned out to be !!! At one point, Linda Darnell was early in her career as one of my favorite things - not much shaken as an actress, but very beautiful and fun (especially in films like Mark Zoro and Blood and Sand) but when I saw this monster, The memories of her golden days faded quickly. The story is incredible and comic, second-rate acting, cast unbearable. I can not think of a more mature performance by anyone than Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man he could pick up. In addition, the photography was terrible (and I'm not just referring to color!) All associated, must tremble whenever they are displayed.
