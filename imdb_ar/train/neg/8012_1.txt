As a lesbian, I always search for movies related to gays and lesbians. However, with this kind of foolishness there - it will be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen - anything! - A story that must be developed or just achieved. To make a kind of sense. did not happen. It was just senseless scenes, unrelated in any way to anything. The film failed to convey any kind of story or depth of character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, you simply stop it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this mess. <br /> <br /> One star - and not worth it.
