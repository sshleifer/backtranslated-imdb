The animation was good, the pictures were good, although they were not completely original, but the story was very long, very confusing, and above dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to get them. With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and draw elements that come from nowhere or go nowhere, this film was not really one film at all and it would have been better to have a short track or maybe two films. If you like this kind of story, you might like it, but frankly, you've spoiled me with much more creative stories that actually contain the kind of messages that should be listed. Go to rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, and you'll get a way out of it.
