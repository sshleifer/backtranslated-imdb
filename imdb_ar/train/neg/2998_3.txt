For fans of Judy Garland fans only. There are 2 really good numbers - one where you do a number with the oldest cleaning lady (I've seen all the pictures) and a very good number at the end. There are a few scenes where the fonts are funny. But, basically, the script is very bad and the film is so dated that it's hard not to overheat the awful all the time. But it's worth 2.50 to rent a movie - just be prepared to go ahead quickly.
