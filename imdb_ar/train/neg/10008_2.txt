The film is bad There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what is "pedestrian" or what I really care about. I felt as if I were watching a movie from the 1970s. The subject was unbelievable for 2007, even in the capital. I think this applies to anyone else who also saw it because the applause was low and fast in the end. Most of them did not stay in Q & A either. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrider really believed that the film would end early. Many scenes seem to have been shortened as if they were never finished or did not know how to finish them. I jumped from one scene to another and had to try to figure out or guess what was going on. I really did not get a special life for Lodi (or Carter) or her boyfriend too. What were all the forms of "technical" male slavery and torture (from Iraqi prisons)? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt to try to create this dark life of the subconscious of a Woody character (car). Did not work. It did not really make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is Woody Harrison. His character (car) played flawlessly. I really felt what "pedestrians" might be (for example 20 years ago). It was fantastic and probably will not be recognized at all. <br /> <br /> For Lauren, Lilly and Christine ... boring. <br /> <br /> Do not see it! It's painful! Unless you are a true lover of Harrelson.
