Fun movies can be very fun with low budgets, bad representation, and a little headache. I think the film is missing forever, because, in a haughty boring scene, one after the other, people get hurt by a harmless claw in the air. If it is not too boring, it may be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror film can go a long way in a tired sense like "university kids in a haunted house", in the same way that evil has had a lot of fun with a similar standard scheme. The end of Halos, unfortunately, does not go a long way. In fact, do not go anywhere. She spends the best part of an hour preparing unknown and unknown characters with seemingly endless personal drama. I have nothing against the evolution of personality, not even in horror film, but these figures are one dimension accurately (male alpha, millet, and ... mother ... hidden characters are often found for sex scenes.) Spending more than forty non-blood , The minutes passed by the drones were even more horrendous than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, bloodshed anyway. When college children turn to anything they wear as if they were in a haunted house (a vampire, wearing OR rub and some white pancakes) they look pretty much the way they did in the fashion of their haunted house; the dead living hatred, using a similar theme, is Masterpiece in comparison. There is really no talk to mention, and there are no real fears. <br /> <br /> I've thought about this from almost every approach. If it was supposed to be a horror film that is very narrow and impressive (which explains why things move very slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters negate it. If the film is supposed to be a real horror of blood and courage (which explains why), where is blood and courage? The anticlimax is one of the non-dramatic endings of the film I've ever seen. It is a kind of film, although it does not contain a narrator through the film, but it was booked by increasing the sound because the whole meaningless dialogue was not enough. <br /> <br /> This was a hard film ... out of it, I wonder if you've just sat through a Christian horror movie. Maybe "I know hell" was not intended to open this way, but there are some hints (or misdirection - I'm not sure). In spite of all the obscene words in the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" is not without absurdity, as are most crosses of worship, fear of God and fear of the devil, especially after some scenes of sex that cause fear and optimism. , One lesbian). <br /> <br /> If a Christian company (Highland Myst's logo has some resemblance to the crucifixion of Christ), this film weighs heavily on the atheist camp. A macro-omnipotent object can not be bad for the director. <br /> <br />
