This I have to one of the worst takes on vampires conceived by men. How can one turn such a fascinating subject into an inspirational story at all? It is difficult not to be such a difficult task ... First of all, the indispensable condition for any vampire is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sensational touch, and this lacks all these things .. Lots of light - spots! My God, why was the name of Christ / Judah revolving around this? There was only one scene that made it worth watching, near the end of the film (a beautiful dance with Dracula and his new vocals) . I really enjoyed the first, Judas-twist game was creative, but that's not good, not by any means. We hope that the third person will draft the vampire signature that I like very much in other classics such as Herzog or Coppola Dracula or even an interview with the vampire.
