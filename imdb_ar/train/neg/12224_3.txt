Barbara Streisand directs the stars in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> For an opportunity to get an education, Babs masquerades with enthusiasm as a boy is not the hardest thing to do because she really looks like a boy, anyway. She meets in her new school with many male colleagues who have no problem whatsoever in believing she is young. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the chance to enjoy many moments of unintended humor when a friend of Babs thinks she is a man, but "pinches him on the ground", sits on his "and" looks tenderly at his "eyes." * snicker *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre; a shocking story about anything that is particularly interesting.
