"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light family movies you can watch and crossword puzzles in The New York Times at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen to get the taco and corona, you will not have to "turn off" the DVD temporarily. Just let it spin, because you will not lose anything really important. No shifts, turns, or tension. It is not a truly ethnic film, it is a film about a poor immigrant family struggling to become Latin. They could have been any ethnic group. The teams made it very simple. I've seen it all once in a million. Just connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family. They had only different accents and names. If the Vargas family were named after Bush or Clinton and were a sheikh, the film would be a complete snooze. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here could not control the language. Some said it was Harlem of Spain. Some Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a New Yorker for life, I vote for the Lower East Side. The family seemed to never meet anyone except the other Latins. They lived in a small enclosure isolated / isolated. Some interaction with non-Latins may have created some excitement, interest or tension. Do you remember the story of the western side? <br /> <br /> Now for the cinema that has been criticized a lot. I do not know if my TV is what or what, but all the internal shots seemed very orange to me. The apartment and the furniture and faces were all orange. What was it supposed to mean? And the apartment. You look too tight for me. Someone mentioned here that the old apartment / apartment has very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What the angel did is divide one large to two or three very small and squeeze as many immigrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And there's something else annoying .... This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week in which a teenage boy "goes off" is this special sexual act necessary for us to watch? Please free me! What's up with these directors? <br /> <br /> So Victor Vargas is a cute little movie. It was good to have a change to see young Latino actors get a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers failed them, and gave them a flat text and distinctive to work with them. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the Quick Launch button.
