T. Rama Rao made some very beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a film director who can not mature with changing times, styles and fashion. It's like stuck in the old filmmaking style itself. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, they are not good either. Anil Kapoor generally behaves in the role of father and son, but the defective text often makes him seem funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - it's always good, and here it is nothing more than this. They do the best they can, but they always do. In conclusion, nothing great at all. Raveena is fine, that means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a delayed film? Well, even then it will still be substandard. The script is terrible, the movie overpriced, and the story does not go anywhere. It looks like a movie created in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look bigger, and the style looks like the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend, unless you are a great fan of starring actors.
