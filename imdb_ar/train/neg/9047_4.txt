This movie has always left an impression on me. I saw him as a high school student and I was home alone that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor after he was a big fan of Brady Bunch. I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was awful and evil. However, this film has had a great impact on me. I am now a volunteer in the Women's State Prison, conducting Bible studies and ecclesiastical services and trying to change the lives of women every time. What surprises me is that very few people actually saw this film. None of my friends and family have seen it until today when I discussed this film because they did not see it.
