If there is a ZERO rating, I will give it to this movie. This was the second time I tried to watch it and could not get it from start to finish. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and I can only assume that they know the actors or they are propaganda in disguise! Representation is terrible everywhere, the script is blah, and the child who plays with Nicole does not show any emotion even when threatened. The "Southern" accent of the actress playing Amber is laughable - I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me nobody talks about like this! None of her emotions were real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
