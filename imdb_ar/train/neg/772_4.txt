This film is not as good as all the movies of Christ that I have ever seen. I am quite surprised that Pilate wants to end Jesus in this story when the Bible (as well as other films) is different. It also lacks a very important issue: the resurrection. No other film transcends this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this particular event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ does not rise from the dead, our faith is false." A very impressive sight for me in this film was seeing the palm streets that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, in exchange for my co-workers, Jesus was not a legend. In fact, he was also a Jew. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say, God became human) who truly changed man. I strongly advise him (since he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most intelligent Jewish commentator in the first. century.
