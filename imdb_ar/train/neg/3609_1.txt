This must be the worst horror film I've ever seen. I remember watching him years ago when he first appeared on a video and for a strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, run out to buy a DVD once it's released ... What a tragic mistake! You will not even bother going into this plot because it is so transparent that you can see it properly anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to the bad effects of cheese and bad representation, but these people take this to a completely different level. It seems as though they are deliberately trying to make the worst possible human film ... if that is their goal, they have succeeded. If they intend to produce a movie that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, form or form that it is real, they failed ... in a scary way! Avoid this movie ... Read the summary of the plot and see it!
