This film dates back to the history of F.B.I as Knott's Berry Farm is located in the Old West. A sterile version of the FBI's anti-crime. The heavy Hoover hand (does he have any other type?) Shows all the time with reps on the quality of reading texts from teevee, cheese sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart with a 20% capacity of dramatic ability, Fira Miles chews the scene, Everyone is known in the mid-1950s with a hint of irony or humor, from "Amazon Forest" to "BBQ in the Backyard", and everything beats the vocal stages and the back pack. Even the canned and familiar shots. I imagine that Mervyn Leroy was drunk every night. With the exception of a few (very few) interesting outside shots, there is nothing here to mention behind the antiques.
