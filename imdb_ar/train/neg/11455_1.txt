First, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedy I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I hated: Dear Evan, Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I had to follow my instinctive first and extinguished "Hot Rod" after I reached the 20 minute mark. I knew at that point that this film would not make me laugh once. The program is extremely brutal - I have no idea how this mutant has managed to break 6 on IMDb. Any person over 10 years of age should enjoy this somewhat flawed. <br /> <br /> This does not come close to Will Weil Farrell It is clear that Andy Samberg can not afford anything longer than a 5-10 minute draw on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they stole Ian MacShane and Isla Fischer to do this movie ... they have to have dues or something. I came to know that it would be a stupid film, but I thought it would be at least funny. I did not smile very much. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on IMDb movies, but this was so bad, I just had to warn people. This is the fourth film I just saw forced to rate the 1/10 rate.
