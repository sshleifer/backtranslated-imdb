This movie is the worst film, but it ranks very high for me. This is how the movie should be bright. This is done at a university where a few students seem. Teachers are dumber than a bag of hammers. It is full of good Catholic priest, and sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. Dialogue clich√©s, hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotations. The pieces enjoy a little creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitals. There is no continuity in the soundtrack and the characters deserve to die because they are too bad, I recommend this movie to spend a fun time. Get the status of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
