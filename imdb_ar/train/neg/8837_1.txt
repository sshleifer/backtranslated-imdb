This terrible film I was really looking forward to, because I thought that "Lantana" was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, good stuff: looks great, and some presentations are good. Bad things are everything else about it. <br /> <br /> As you know, the story is about some of the holes that hunt and discover a body, as they develop on Friday, but they continue fishing and finally arrive on Sundays when they return on a mobile phone. However, the film takes time (the boy takes his time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> From the group of characters (about twelve), no one seems to like the other. I suppose, consistent, because they are all undesirable). I was very frustrated by the failure to explain how the characters were sufficiently connected, and I could only build the family tree in a mysterious way near the end of the film. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a movie that is too dark for us, a failure in the structure of the story, because the character's life looks bad before the fishing trip as it was afterwards. Once the tape is set to a very high degree, it is difficult to be less than anyone who commits suicide. <br /> <br /> There are silly flaws in logic. The killer ejects the body into the lake, and then drifts in a maze in the direction of the upstream to the mountains. Fishermen come out on Sunday morning, but for some reason, Berne returns home late at night after his wife goes to bed. Then the first thing the next morning the noise of the police on the door to get him to go down to the station. Um, have not heard of the phone? At the station, the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after reporting the body? <br /> <br /> Completely missing from the story is the debate that went on between the flames certainly after the body was found. This puzzle - everyone asks them "how can you do it?" The public asks the same question. (Discussion about what to do with the body is the main scene in "Survival"). I know exactly what I was doing in their situation. Someone needs to go out to the car, drive to a group of portable devices, call the police, wait, and guide them back to the site. If others are waiting in the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> It seems that much of this is not true. The only true thing is that, as the girl was black, the Aboriginals took the fishermen's actions as racism - "it would not have been for a white girl." <br /> <br /> Throughout there is a curious indifference of who has killed the girl (I think this topic is mentioned once), and there is no mystery, as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene. <br /> <br /> So I'm sitting there at one time bored and confused, when there is a twist - not in the plot, but in the subject. Suddenly it is about the quiet dignity of bereaved indigenous peoples that leads to an ironic end with some incoherent things about reconciliation between blacks and whites. Hey? <br /> <br /> This is an Australian film "at its best", according to the age.
