Through the story of baby numbers (Prince), singer, on his way to become a star. Then falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father who defeats his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a theater in 1984. I was not very impressed with the prince but I liked the three great songs in this film - Purple Rain, Let's Get Crazy and When Doves Cry. Scenes of concerts in this wonderful film - filled with energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a very small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly explicit and has been performed many times before - and much better too. They are subplots, in good standing, and poorly handled. The love triangle between The Kid and Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictive and tired that I actually became insulted. There is a need for his wife who beats his father for the story, but the scenes are treated very badly (in acting and direction) so much that I could not believe her. The scenario is terrible - poor dialogue and some really painful "comedy" actions. There is a lot of dislike here - the mother of the child is beaten; the child runs into Appolonia (without reason) and goes barefoot to swim in a dirty river. Williams and the female princes also treated women in a horrific way. <br /> <br /> Acting is where this film really fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but there is no representative. The prince (easily) is the worst actor I have ever seen. His empty face and the delivery of the wooden dialogue were very bad and I could not believe it. This film only comes to life during the concert scenes but there is not much really. "Dramatic" scenes are treated so badly that they make the film a must-see. They should have just made this movie a concert. I give this 2 - only to music.
