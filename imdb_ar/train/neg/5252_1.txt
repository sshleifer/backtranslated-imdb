I read some online comments about this movie like "... harder then came down ...", "the camera never shows up when it becomes brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera is never displayed, because nothing is displayed on the screen. The same scene is repeated one hundred and one hundred times. Women lie on the table, the murderer rapes women several times, the killer cuts women to pieces (never see this during the entire film!). The police came and arrested him. Killer con jury. The film ended. In Germany we say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
