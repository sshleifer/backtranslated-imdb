This could be a nice film for the kids, once seen by my grandson. He was watching it again and I was watching some of it. <br /> <br /> When the little bear is lost on the tongue of ice and is in the water he tries to reach a piece of ice saying "Come stupid stupid ass". <br /> <br /> I do not want his 3 year old grandson to watch movies with words like this in them. <br /> <br /> That's why he was rated for children. You must be child friendly. That's what I was expecting. Developed by the Warner Brothers and G rating I expect that this does not have curse words in it. Words do not fit with the movie in most places as it seems later. The film pulls in many parts.
