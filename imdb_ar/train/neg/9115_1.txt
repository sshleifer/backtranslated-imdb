If you ask me first one was really the best one. See Sarah M. She's a real, middle, tough girl. Look at Amy Adams. She's just a little fool hanging around. Is nothing! People do not like it! Second, Sebastian was nice and warm in the first film, and now he has become a "baby face". The story is not good, I do not understand. Why did not they do this first, it's the beginning. Loose actors, nothing with the story. This is not cruel, this is playing. The first one has the best actors, the best story and the means. I think music is better in harsh intentions 1 and music better in harsh intentions 3. Not the worst film I've ever seen, but in the first film, there's nothing big, big or big.
