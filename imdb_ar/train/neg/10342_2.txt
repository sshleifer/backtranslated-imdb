Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most unbelievable couple on the screen since John Travolta and Lilly Tomlin. Larry Pierce's direction is relentless between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly believes that the first and his self-centered performance in a secondary role underscores the complete lack of balance and chemistry among the actors in the film. Normally, I do not like to let myself worry very much, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books at all, watching what they did by making me literally crazy.
