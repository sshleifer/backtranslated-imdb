This film is not only boring, but also very bad. The graphics are very poor, they are not even second class - they are horrible. The characters do not show any expressions of the face, the voice representation is empty and without any spirit, the plot completely lacks the ... well ... anything and everything. My 5 year old baby loves it - but he thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
