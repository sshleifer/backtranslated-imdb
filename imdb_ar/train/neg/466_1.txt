How can I express my feelings about this film: Ugly? a headache? Do not write cohesively? Ordinary stupidity? Try all of the above for this tragedy. This is only for direction. <br /> <br /> Story?

Of course, the turtle reserve for the fake turtle, which builds it with the casino's profit. <br /> <br /> Sounds like all these things seem funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but not so. The imaging sequence is not properly serialized. I have seen a better portrayal of Hong Kong films. The pictures are average for a late 80s movie.
