I saw this movie the other night. I can not even begin to express the amount of absorption of this film. Writing, voice acting, even clay. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching a 24-hour C-Span for comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls almost everywhere. <br /> <br /> The animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know this is a one-person film, but I think it can be a fool for 97 minutes, and maybe at least make the film funny at least one second. <br /> <br /> This offer may take a cake because it is the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It was really that bad. If you are looking for a movie that would make you laugh, keep clear of this horror. My advice: Do not buy it or look for it in this regard. Your mind will than you.
