I see a lot of people like this movie. To me this film was really made in writing 101 and the person failed in class. From Lindsey Price's time, the video cameraman appeared until the end of the film and was highly anticipated. I kept watching to see if they were going anywhere. <br /> <br /> First, we have a young widowed father. Cliché # 1 / TV always kills a parent if the child is a girl, or a child's incubator, so that the only father can be spilled on his dead wife and it appears that he is completely out of care of the children. Starting from my 3 sons to 2 1/2 parents. These films are usually comedic dramas, television programs. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 2 When an opportunistic woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play a big role in the film. You will always have solutions or even if that person is an Air Head <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If a person is in foreign danger, they must be of Latino origin. They must be illegal. It is clear that there are no legal Latins and illegal Europeans, unless there is an IRA element in question. <br /> <br /> Clicé # 4 A Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case he was a professor making 200 per month. The Latini must now act as if he has not failed in his head now and allows the side kick of the air head to take control. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime committed by the person was not really a crime but an accident. But because in this case he lost all the feeling he felt when he crossed the border, he now behaves like a fool, and now puts his daughter in danger by taking her in an unproductive endeavor to the border with the dumb side. kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 No one ever runs on a leader who runs from a crime, but some poor little kids are cute. This is because the child's parents have to run a large part of the film, and because the person who accidentally killed the child can have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7. The movie where there is not a single policeman is an angry veterinarian and is mated with the rookie. Even if they are murder investigators who must be the most experienced policemen in the police force. Sev7n and cat copy and law and order come to mind immediately. The veterinarian even though the giraffe on the outside has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's go and get together some of the soap stars who are unemployed. Now I love Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not go on her way out of a paper bag, and when she used to be in One Life to Live as Marty, he was swinging from right to left each time she opened her mouth. She used to get me sick sea. You may be grounded better now, but still unable to move. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been richer if it was not full of words. I do not think the film should be expensive or cerebral. But this was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now will not spoil the end. Oh, I'll do because I feel it would be offended for humanity to let a person waste time it will not come back to this movie. It includes cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless someone sees a movie before you have to see what happens. The father commits a stupid mistake that runs from the police in the end, and the angry veteran hits him, which is very sudden. You think she thinks the poor guy is innocent throughout the film and shot him by mistake. When they did not. Now for the little girl the father brought with him. Guess what happens to her? Over time, it ends up living with the family whose father was killed by her father !! Come on! You all know that it will happen, because it is an alternative child !! That's why she did not go and live with Lindey Price's personality. <br /> <br /> This movie was as insulting as I was concerned. Since there are many ways this film can explore and retreat, he chose to take the vulgar vulgar image. The two stars were special for the stars, the little girl, who thought she was very good and Lindsey Price was an annoying figure but she did everything she could with her. My advice is to take a deputy and squeeze your head with him instead of looking at this dredging
