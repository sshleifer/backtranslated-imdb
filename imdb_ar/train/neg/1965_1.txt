It is clear that Stephen J. Canell decided a few years ago that he would expand his horizons and play in horror. The result, "Dead Above the Earth", is an abysmal piece of garbage. Now, if I noticed his name associated with this special film, I would return it but no, I did not wear my glasses so I missed it, damn, I really need to bring those with me during the shopping video. The first question will be, Who is the target audience for this? The "scary" children's film is almost like, but again, there are naked children and some girls and some bad words that have appeared here and there. The main characters are so nice that you want to see someone, someone, chasing him with some kind of farm tools. It seems that the man opens beds and breakfast has a fickle past, witch to kill the children gathered the teeth of the children living there. Maybe something the real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in modern times there is a small ghost for girls to warn the real little girl who now lives there and that will happen something bad. There are also two Bubbas sitting on this property when the new owner took their place until they also avenged. All of this makes some custom-made baby litter for Halloween except for things that are not suitable for young children of course, so it's not just average, it's also confusing. This is a new starting point along with Ansho Bay and Wohishan on the Gulf of Anchor, also taking into account their record with good releases. The UK got the Phantasm Box and got the "Tooth Fairy". It hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute garbage.
