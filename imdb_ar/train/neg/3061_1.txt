This movie is awesome. Give me a dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations here in the Arabian Peninsula was their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expect to enjoy the crowds with Dudley Moore instead. The last time I looked at the hot water vial, it had more effect, better plot, more drama, and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Do not watch it even if you're drunk!
