Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has an idea about a story must be embarrassed by the series. Borg does not come until Q brings the enterprise to the Gamma sector, and the Klingons are never seen until they come across Kirk. NCC-1701 was the first ship named Enterprise .... Do I need to continue? Berman and Beliar made a mockery of the creation of Jane Roddenberry. After his death, they only saw the $$$$ and went their own way. No wonder Magell Barrett was in every episode of Star Trek until this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bacola. He is a wonderful actor, as are the entire actors. I love them all, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents identified by the original series. Just check the labels. I think more people saw Deep Space 9 (which was canceled at an inconvenient time).
