I am a producer, producer, director and what I am saying is facts. This project was the worst film in the history of filmmaking. From the product to the director and modify this movie called a joke and I mean a big joke. Why blockbuster issued such a crap? I take my work seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad film? I do not think so. I saw bad zombie movies, but this takes the Coffie cake and everything on the table is a curse. This movie sucks! I really hate talking badly about other directors because I'm one person, but please think about taking on a different career. I respect the fact that you completed a film, but I have to ask you, "Did you smoke in the crack?" I mean makeup on your daughters, the scary zombie, what you were thinking. For the whole nation, if I could vote for zero, I would be. Worst movie in history making movie !!!
