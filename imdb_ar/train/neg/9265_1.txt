After listening to Haren Bernhard's Omen II comment, I was shocked to discover that he was behind this absolute garbage. It's like a very bad TV movie that you may hint at in the middle of the day when you have flu and a disease that is hard to reach remotely. I think that in the place where Michael Lerner faces what I can only describe as Les Miserables high school teacher, my mouth has commented on infidelity. Then my mouth went up and down because I was laughing a lot. terrible. I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, I explained my point in brief, there is nothing clever about all this modern talk.
