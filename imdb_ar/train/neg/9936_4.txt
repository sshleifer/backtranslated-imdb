I picked this up for 50 cents in the second-hand goods market and was very enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> I found it fantastic for about 15 minutes, then frequent and boring. <br /> <br /> It's a great vision for Mick and the gang in the prime, I hope there's not a lot of dubbing on the dialogue so I can hear what they're saying and playing. <br /> <br /> Short stories of political history are incredibly naive and simple from poorly written monty python on acid. I spent a lot of time looking at the late 1960s, then what really happened in silly plays. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times are already changing, and what is important quickly becomes plain ridiculous. A good song, but has been played yet by this DVD.
