A young American woman visits her Irish roots and addresses her gloomy witchcraft. It seemed intriguing but after an interesting start, I missed and spent most of the time wondering where to go. The film seems to be swaying in two directions - do we see the hardships of the Irish-American woman struggling with her own alcohol problem or are we watching the flick of terror about a wicked witch from the past? The manager does not seem to decide. The two do not seem to have a flame and in the end you will not get anywhere. This may be much better and the story seems to be heading towards the end. This was more boring and disappointing.
