It's definitely one of the 70 weirder movies that are in this place, which is most famous because it started ten years of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also worth mentioning the little touches of madness in the film, especially when the first half of the dark and mood is replaced by a musical interpreter for all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs was dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who roamed the boat for a while ... Leaves, can not see it again). Although it's a painful date now, I'm still a scary movie to show kids, and anyone with a Bigfoot culture or a 1970's will probably get a kick out of it. My favorite part: a man so scared that he jumps upside down through the door (!?) And the narrator explains that he has lost awareness of the "shock". Uh, saying that breaking the door with his head is probably the cause of unconsciousness, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
