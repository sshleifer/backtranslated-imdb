I agree with the last reviewer that this film was a terrible representation. Yes, there was a lot of unfairness and some nudity. But overshadowed by a slow-motion conspiracy meaningless and stupid ending. Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway: the Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing it instead. One of the technical hassles I have with the DVD is that if you close the Spanish translations, they will return after several scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and stop them again. Also, do not waste your time on the deleted scenes because there is no sound and it just looks like a tourist screenshot.
