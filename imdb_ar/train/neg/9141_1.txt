Man, what was Sam Marovic thinking? What was anyone involved in the thinking of this "film"? Mraovich is the head of almost everything about "Ben and Arthur": director, writer, producer (also executive producer!), Caster, lead star-named, did it. Mraovich absorbs more than anyone who absorbs it in every section of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with this film? everything. The film revolves around gay lovers, Ben (Jimmy Britt Gable) and Arthur (Marovic * Aaron). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone hates homosexuals. To make matters worse, his "crazy ex-wife" Laban (not quite divorced), Tammy (Julie Belknap) evaporates from being left to another man's son and demands Ben to come back together (saying she can be gay too!) And christian Arthur Excessive, and just as slow as Tammy's brother, Victor, is determined to make Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after being expelled from his church. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely immersed in a block with lots of idiots (A. Ben and Arthur travel to Vermont for marriage - they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont have palm trees; they return on a FedEx freighter - I hope they will be comfortable in a wooden crate, in addition to a lot, lots of holes in the plot to take off (Victor calls Arthur's death "final plan" which later changes to the "final act" . The actors are all very bad and are on their way to the top; the script is very bad (eg "I do not understand? You do not understand! I understand, that makes sense!") There is a much bigger mistake in the "film" I do not write all these things. <br /> <br /> However, the most laughable but unbelievable story about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraovich thinks he invented something really wonderful (see his fake remarks about "Ben Arthur" and clear comments by him on YouTube .). Marovic and narcissism overwhelm him to see how wonderful his name really is. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, forget every bad film that claims to be the worst film ever - "Ben and Arthur" will be expelled directly from this title, so Paris Hilton films look like "Dark Knight" compared to the brutality known as "Ben and Arthur".
