Take Frankenstein's basic joke, pump some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Certainly, this was clearly inspired by the above-mentioned films, but never as a single thing. <br /> <br /> A scientist kills his wife by mistake, so the entire movie takes place all night trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decided to cut off parts of the body of some stranded women, and by chance, decided to stay at night in place. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that acting is bad or guidance. Everything here is just a very standard way. What are the simple attempts at humor that actually work? (See the scene when Hackenstein is hiding behind his deaf assistant because she will undoubtedly feel very upset if she sees him holding a woman and her finger), but this is hardly enough to recommend this film. Decent music, what a decent blood, very good appearance. For half an hour, I was delighted with this film. But I never felt that this was more than just a time. Can be avoided. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
