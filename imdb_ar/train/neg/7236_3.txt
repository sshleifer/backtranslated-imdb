Let's see ... I'm trying to train to find positive in everything, so what nice thing can I say about Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances - no, would not work because they succeeded in draining all the characters from Gwyneth Paltrow, which are usually vibrant, and ended up creating cartoons of Carol Kin and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh - How bout The story - no. This will not happen either, because it was a stimulus to snooze. What kind is anyway? Not funny, rule out comedy. It was not interesting to be exciting. Was that a love story between Schweizer and Paltrow? I must ask, because I can not be sure - let's just call it "Losers in Like." I'm sure those who stand behind this film are starting to see, that means they should have one that suits the studio clothes, but I need help finding them. <br /> <br /> Even if you were a patient person who could have forgiven the pure stupidity of the story, I was not in a good conscience to recommend a movie that allowed a man to enter a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy and stupid hair. Talking about poetry - are we supposed to be enjoying the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What should I do? I've already lost 97 minutes that can not be retrieved in actual movie viewing - I can not devote more time to this loser.
