I'm still trying to figure out if there is a point in this film. <br /> <br /> For content that is supposed to be "rebellious" and "controversial", the things Maddox distributes to students are horribly lame. Students seem to have been easily influenced by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and stories of words that are scattered illegally on leaflets. Thaer, everyone. <br /> <br /> I suppose it was absolutely necessary to ask for a teenage mutiny movie where the fire alarm is not fired at school. <br /> <br /> It seems that "a huge fight on football fields" is a battle of two people. <br /> <br /> Characters of characters appear to randomly vary randomly. The football Jock that Madox was fighting (which later became a key element in his face) is all smiles and apology the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it did not reach any real result of the scheme. It makes me feel like the whole thing was installed in half an hour after the private school. If they have cut off most of the alleged wrong soundtrack.
