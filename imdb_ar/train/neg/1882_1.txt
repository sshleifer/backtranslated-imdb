What a horrible piece of trash !!! Who are all these people who talk about how good this is? Yes, he is "intrusive"; yes, he is "weird", but ... this is not enough. This plot is dull and disassembled, like a realistic display but not brilliantly. <br /> <br /> People are not interested in their essence; but as personalities they do not have enough depth to feel empathy with them. If they depend on real people, I am very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of it very violent) seems very provocative and unjustified. It's like the product has the insights of Tarantino Conton. I do not think so much, either. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah: if I have such neighbors, go!
