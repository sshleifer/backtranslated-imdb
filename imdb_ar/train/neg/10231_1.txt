Frankly I am angry that based on the dazzling reviews attributed to Stephen Smith, he wasted almost two hours on his first show. Have they all written by his friends? The excitement is filled, the music is annoying and overuse, the script is simply awesome and the actors (except the gardener) are modest at best. I think we should support the efforts of a young film director, but I would say that he is wonderful when he is certainly not encouraged to make the same mistakes again, that is to continue writing his own texts and to use the same actors in another project. Yes, it is his first film, his low budget, etc. - I get it, but there are also members of the public to buy it is not about scratching.
