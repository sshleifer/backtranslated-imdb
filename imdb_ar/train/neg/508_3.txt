An early film directed by De. Griffith. It is characterized by King Said Said (Arthur F. Johnson) and Queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the king leaves the scene, the queen makes music with the palace Minstrel (Henry B. Walt). When the beloved king discovers, he decides to enact the terrible revenge of Edgar Allen Boo. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear those who conspire against them; although actors try to look noisy alternately (lovers) and calm (cement mixers). Sets make the Sealed Room look very phased. Good performance, easy-to-follow story. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith - Arthur Johnson, Henry B. One example is Marion Leonard
