... and how they carry you right out of your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies of the 1970s made without any actors on the other, an embarrassing text, a comfortable direction, and a tireless desire to combine "horror" with light comedy. The film presents a world of fossils that finds drawings of a water dinosaur down Lake Crater ... A meteor falls from the sky, and a muddy water dinosaur begins to terrorize and eat the people around the life of Criter Lake. The order is taken care of Steve our local sheriff. A large part of the film - when the bloodbaths we left behind when we imagine it was the monster to eat - is spent in the wake of the oblivious indignation of two people, Arne and Mitch, who run a place to charter boats. They try to be very funny, so we get lines like, looking at a brand, Mitch says to me, "You're spelled wrong, it's written by B-A-T-E." The laughter was scarce here. Then we see them drunk together and imagine that the trunk of the tree is the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the film is pleasantly fun. At least, the lake is beautiful.
