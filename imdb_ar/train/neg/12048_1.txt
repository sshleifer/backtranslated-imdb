I've been out of about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not know how I sat within an hour of it. I must be in a coma that night. I saw him in the theater when he came out 8 years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller had starred. You should have really been impressed to waste time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomiting! Vomiting!
