James Bond in the Wild? Well, that's how it looks: Pierce Brosnan is the most famous Bond in "Never Die" (1997) and "The Golden Eye" (1995) - which were filmed before this release. Frankly, both films are largely wrong, with Brosnan turning to the most persuasive performance marginally, and with Annie Gallipo (like Bonnie, Gray O'Leal) forced to engage in a written dialogue with indifference. <br /> <br /> The two women, on the other hand are perfect. But the film is not about the aunts. It is located in about Canadian wild wilderness. Although photography may be beautiful, there is nothing sad about the harsh reality of living in the wilderness. Annie Gallipo, like Bonnie, fails to persuade, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. She was in her twenties relatively inexperienced in this film, and could have worked, but Richard Attenborough may not have been harsh enough. It makes her look weak, of course ... but she's in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is certain, it looks perfect in the picture all the time. But mascara and thick eyebrows in the wild? This does not fit, especially since it never runs in forest trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and uses image capture to capture close-ups. <br /> <br /> I have lived with the forest of people in the Pacific Northwest, they simply do not look this beautiful and stay very sweet while fighting to survive. This leads me to another point: the film failed to recall the period in which he was appointed: the 1930s. The blame here is largely blamed on a weak scenario of preaching at the expense of dramatic arc, plot points and small details that can trigger the period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script, and his latest show, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" opened three days ago, so I hope there will be an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read the comments posted by others, but I'm not convinced. There is a lot of potential, but it has been handled poorly, and perhaps poorly conceived. If he has a religious film, he would have been picked up, but because he preaches the environment, the film remains above criticism, because it is "politically correct." Sorry, for all of that, I do not buy it. Trustworthy.
