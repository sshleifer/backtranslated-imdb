The premise of this film was fit enough, but with sub-representation, it was pleasant and boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS It was a murder that was not like the man who did it. Also through some past memories, there is a secret that has been revealed this kind of events makes events fairly like justice. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so are only those women who relate to her sister and hear her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With some buffing, better to have it good.
