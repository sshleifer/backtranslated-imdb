The boring children's imagination gives Joan Plowright a billing star but little to do. Young children pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (Yuk) while she is running for the best friend Hazel for mayor --- she is 13 years old! Completely pedestrian in everything, plus an additional drawback of the drink offerings by the girls as well as the baseball boys. Definitely less effort for Showtime --- Unlimited?
