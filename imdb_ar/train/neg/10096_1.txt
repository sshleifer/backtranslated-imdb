This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film fools the public into thinking there is probably hope. The line of the movie story is laughable at best, with very bad representation you just have to cringe. The title "Zombie Nation" includes a treasure of zombies while in fact there are six in total. This movie can not be rated as a horror film due to the introduction of Cheesy 80 music when zombie attack. The zombie actually speaks and acts like humans in the film, the only difference is make-up that looks like something from a video not a rou. If you get a chance to buy this movie, do so, then burn the copy.
