### The saboteurs! ### <br /> <br /> What is the screening of this film? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches an awesome plot. It is sad to see the talents of Denzel Washington get lost in such a garbage. We certainly are hinting that the Mexicans can not save themselves, from the necessary external forces, perhaps military, American. We know that the father is a shady person, he is Mexican after all, unlike the wife that Creasy appreciates more because he is American. He killed them all believing they were dead. Is it? Of course, she will not, she is a little girl and is not supposed to hurt the feelings of fans of Hollywood. The sudden scene was the only thing that prevented me from categorizing it as "unreasonably successful" (as some critics pointed out) "caught". The nausea of ​​these films will take a long time to go. In categorizing such films, we have to doubt the credibility of IMDb's.7.7 for such a film and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go and conclude! The mine will be within 3.5-4.0
