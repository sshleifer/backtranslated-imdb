Well, I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. The first thing that was put in the film is not real, they all act. They can not sing. They are very full of themselves. terrible. Yes, children may enjoy the age of 8 to 10 years but this is really stupid. I mean they say their manager is a child. There is a fake registry label. Its stupid. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> As for preparation and guidance, it is not too bad. It's a nice documentary but it documents something stupid. <br /> <br /> See this only if you do not like really good music. Also, it is very tacky. It's not so tasty. I hate to be mean it ... but this is really a piece of garbage.
