It may be a bit harsh for me when I say it, but unfortunately, so far in his direct career. Just look at what he has done so far. Barely surpassed the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why did you watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and the heroes of the star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was featured in this film, and her performance carries the entire film. I hope you get a "big group" and merge into a larger association of actors, obviously possessing skills. Greg was not impressive, in a typical television show. <br /> <br /> The film has been strangely classified as a horror. The only "horror" is memories of short memories, lasting for a maximum of 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. Personally, I will call it "drama / excitement". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story really is, poor direction, editing and representation (Lucy's application) destroy it. You have no real contact with actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit there watching nothing feeling. It's like watching bad TV soap .... In fact I think the TV soap will be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better still, just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with.
