The first (and only) time I saw where "shades" were during Sneakpreview. It was not even in the first show. I remember that there was someone from the board of directors, I do not remember who. It was a Belgian film, and we never heard of it, so we were completely neutral, and we do not know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a wonderful actor standing a mile away in front of everyone. He plays the role of the actor who stopped the star long ago from climbing. It helps to achieve a film in Belgium entitled "Shadows". <br /> <br /> Once the movie starts, we notice how much the right is performing. Nothing against a word I swear at times. However this road was annoying behind. When Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the acting team, speaking in a non-English language, uses the word F **** or ****, he becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost the number of times the words F and S. were used. Everyone was happy to get out of the theater. We had to vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10, and we were looking for -10.
