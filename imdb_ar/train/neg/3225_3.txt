Children love dinosaurs. It's part of their culture to some extent. But they have land ahead of time. the original. At least this film was the heart. this is. This film is just pathetic. Just because children love dinosaurs does not mean that you can just compile any old story and show it to children. This film contains no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and more in numbers. Spirit does not suck like Theodore Rex, but it is far from being a land before time.
