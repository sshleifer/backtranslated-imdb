After seeing the poster from Smother, I knew I was about to live one of those unbearable film experiences that made me want to take my eyes out. However, I was slightly optimistic that the film had strong actors who thought he was about to save the film. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Movies are a terrible film, but that's not easy. This is the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> A script from Smother (written by the same people from the license to Wednesday, which explains why they have nothing but the talent of writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. Seriously, I did not even laugh once I saw this movie. Waste. After the large number of rubbish that I participated in (such as the terrible and fun work I did because I said so), some people might think that Diane Keaton's career is extinguishing. However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances. We have brought previo to us decades, in movies like Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother, do her best through her performance, but her character is so terribly written that she can not do anything with her. Dax Shepard left me a good impression of his strong way of showing on Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does his best with his personality. Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not go too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he did in films like The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I wanted to see that he was a screenwriter in this film, instead of just working on it. Lyl Tyler lives in the same position as all the actors mentioned above: waste. <br /> <br /> The worst failure of Smother is to be boring and completely unfamiliar. Its scenario is nothing more than a set of scenes and coercive attitudes that we have seen in the Kommes sit-ins. Stay away from this crazy comedy.
