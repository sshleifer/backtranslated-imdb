Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study all the wrong things, you should not make a good film. I'm not one of the people reviewing a movie, but this is a personal film. I have wasted the precious time they can not repay. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others to waste time watching this nonsense. If this is a student project, I have to say it is not bad, but only during the first 15 minutes ... then it becomes troublesome. Yelling, bad sound, bad video (a good camera man has made it much better). And yes, what is Blair's influence - the witch? No budget? I hoped the situation would improve, but it did not happen. Now how the hell worth 4? 2 is more just but 1 to waste my time! I said salami.
