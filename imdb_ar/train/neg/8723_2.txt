Very bad film. A very bad film is very rare, but it is not worth pursuing. This Italian jugular dislocation does not make much sense most of the time, and does not feel the rest. "Crocodile" is not convincing at all, and a lot of sub plots do not go anywhere. If you're in the local video store, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but not worth following.
