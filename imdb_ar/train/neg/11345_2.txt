I mean "infantry". The film's producers seem to have forgotten anything interesting. Faith Dumberg can do better than this. She is supposed to be the mysterious and chosen Cobra goddess torn by the love of Marshall Thompson (there is an idea, eh?). Instead, she is a possible common housewife in the 1950s, and the single expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they released it all in the early morning before Feith took up her mind. As for the rest of the actors, they are all "so hard on Americans" that the result is laughable. This land is covered more effectively in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I believe that the "Cobra cult" should be labeled "worship of contractual obligation". Why do many other talented people otherwise sleep their way despite the failure of slow-moving, predictable, such a failure?
