It starts badly, with the three women in high school and sitting around laughing with the jinn, endless cigarettes, chocolate with caramel for the best story of a man, and things get worse - the spoiler in case Alert = - = What happens with the character of Andy who falls on the young organist who used to be a student when he was 14 years old (she is an English school principal, believe it or not), just to destroy him thanks to the bitch, from hell "girlfriend". Then, from there, they are basically unchanged: she forgives her 'friend' and has a love child for a member of the organ and ends 3 women with their start, and drink more jinn and smoke more cigarettes smoked Blah Blah Blah. Andy drops chocolate with caramel in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Be merciful.
