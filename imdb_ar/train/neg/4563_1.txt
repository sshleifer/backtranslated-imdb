This film is probably the cheapest, richest and poorest film ever created. <br /> <br /> However, it is the funniest and most obscure movie of Disney, and will ensure laughter of happy stories and lame plots from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's a collection of short stories that look like bad fairy tales. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first thing about Beast and Belle is trivial on the pathetic argument. Then, three new lost personalities decide to correct things by falsifying the letter of tolerance to give Belle. Through this small episode, Billy has eyes on the wall, which made my brothers and I laugh hard. Then, she and the beast are fighting more on the message ... and later learned the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they ??? It is certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, all else is that Lumiere is the world's biggest anesthetic when it comes to romance. This comes from a man who can attract anything female. They also make FiFi deceptive psychotic trying to kill Belle, and eventually out of Scotch in the end. What a message to send children! <br /> <br /> Then, the following message revolves around Mrs. Potts's anger. In the next stage after all this, Beast became too birdlike to seem so silly. <br /> <br /> The cartoon is extremely ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 errors you can see clearly ... and terrible coloring. <br /> <br /> Belle is a simplified juicer that shines whenever an error occurs. In addition, they are small and quite different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> The characters on the side are annoying ... (I mean that Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting almost all the time ... I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in this.) <br /> <br /> But worse Personality is Ms. Boots. I have destroyed in this. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it 1/10 for the copy, but I give it 10/10 for the comedy.
