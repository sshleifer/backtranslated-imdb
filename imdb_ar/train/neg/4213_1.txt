Wow, I am an enthusiast of the Henry VIII era / Theodore Huge, well, this has been interesting. The only one I saw was Catherine Aragon. Wow ... just wow. I have seen misconduct before, but this has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine mother ... crying? She cries and screams, and I must admit that I have returned many times ... many times .... funny and funny things. The actress who plays Anne Pauline was the only person who showed even a small slice of talent (I may be biased and have a slight obsession with Anne Pauline. She was a really wonderful woman, and I read it, it's worth it!) Also, I've read a lot about the period Timothy and I think the characters were not displayed accurately, they were all very typical. Watch this movie only if you're ready to see a very important time period, and the lives of the big people involved have turned into laughing stocks.
