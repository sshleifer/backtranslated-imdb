This movie was written and directed very badly, I slept for 30 minutes during the film. The jokes in the film are passionate, and although the plot is interesting in some angles, it is very far away and in some ridiculous points. If you are 11 years old or older, you will ignore the writing in the film and be disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or younger, this is a movie that will catch your attention and be surprised at all the stunts (which I have added have not been poorly implemented) ) I wish I were some warrior to. The cast was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was as if they were trying to increase tension but it was not at all appropriate. 1-10 (10 Excellent, 1 Very Bad) The representation in this film is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movies, in some of the most serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some "fight" her, I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this film is definitely the output, for example, the part in which the enemy shows that he is the person possessed by the villain, and how his voice turns into darkness and evil, and I think this was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy (Brenda Song) All her teachers in the school were monks, and that was very ridiculous. To sum it all up, the movie is disappointing, but ok if you are 10 years old or less.
