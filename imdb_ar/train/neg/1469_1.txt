Such as watching the home movies of the summer camp, "Indian Summer" is a handful of sleep. Barely eight camp graduates are presented, when the memories of the past begin to be incredibly boring for characters we know nothing about. The beautiful actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are completely lost in this film. One remark from the vehicle that "everything looks much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you tired. The expected pranks are not funny or original, unless you think the short covers are a real "howl". This movie was very disappointed given the ample talent involved. "Indian Summer" did not make me homesick, just sick. - Merck
