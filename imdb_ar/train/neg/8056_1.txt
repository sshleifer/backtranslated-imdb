"Incitement" is boring, exciting and incoherent, in which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagiler) is considered the permanent victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident that kills her friend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not begin to tell you how dangerous this is ... Nothing happens at all and there is no kind of actual entertainment value. I did not like this actor in this particular film - they are all not convinced of sadness (and then again, their roles are not good). Promote this as a horror film prank. Where are the fears? There is no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> How did this project get the green light on the ground? Writer / Director Steve Carpenter has no vision or talent to see. Worst of all, the conclusion makes the whole film useless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "Killer Killer" I have seen is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
