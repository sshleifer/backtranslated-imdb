"Dominique" is one of those films in which the expression "slow sugar molasses" should be invented. Lots of endless and repetitive sequences (how often do we see Robertson walking slowly down the stairs because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is almost eventually replaced by a surprise, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second development that succeeds only in leaving the bad taste in our mouths. Not a very interesting film.
