I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard about this film, I do not really know whether it's in the theater at all. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of the post-school specials. Acting is fine, not great. The plot was rather weak and the lines were beautiful. So the only comment I can make for this movie is "Eh". I borrowed the movie from Jeremy. If you're in a movie rental place, this is a comment I will imagine after watching it and I will not recommend it to anyone who is middle school age. I have also noticed that often when urban children are photographed, slang is used excessively or externally. I often think this is what makes their characters incredible.
