Another very bad lowest what can go here is one. Otherwise this will get an easy zero. Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, Beckenba's name was not what I did not guess he did. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco that I know was in the group very much and from nearly sunset, he says Sam was simple. This appears in the spades. The laughing thing in the first part of the film is the only thing in this whole mess that deserves a second look. Not even Gig Young is changeable. This is a real test of the mazushi. If I had to go into the theater room to see him, I would jump screaming. And now I really feel guilty after I saw all of that very comfortable couch which was very nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than make-up while offering. It's not just a bomb but the bmob spells backwards. Yikes !!!!!
