There is something sad about seeing someone very good at doing something that tries to do something very different ... and you end up being modest. I was thinking about playing Jordan for baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie was conceived and directed fairly well, but the scenario is stinky. Martin did a great job of adapting a classic story in a comedy in Roxanne, but this effort to bring Victorian drama to the contemporary scene directly collides with a wall of unreasonableness. If you want to see an old story that has been updated in some way, it is best to rent a Great Expectations.
