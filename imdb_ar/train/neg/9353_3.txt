I've acquired the title ... I was expecting an insightful and interesting trip into alcoholism, and instead I got a boring and uninspired story about Cloudy Scott. <br /> <br /> The leading personality is not given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify teenage-like hair as a psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a disgrace, because the essence of the story could have been good, with a better effort to portray the inner feelings of a man who had to co-exist with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be like "I am what I am because this is my case." A bad and funny attempt to give a kind of poetic edge to a lower-class man makes matters worse. The use of excessive "poète maudit" clichés is a quick way to find a boring film that looks elegant, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not so clever, artistic or meaningful ... the leading personality does not develop at all, and fails the weak attempt to change without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt that occurred instead of blue. <br /> <br /> The film is heavily borrowed from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but eventually fails to regain their grandeur, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson placed great emphasis on the technical aspect of the story, neglected the rest, and gave us an eye-catching film, but it is brainwashed.
