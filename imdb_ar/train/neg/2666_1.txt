Frankly, if anyone has a mind, there is not one positive thing <br /> <br /> to tell about this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost one dollar to rent this. I prefer to laugh at Will Smith, saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must be bored or not known at the time. Even Matthew Mc Conahay * however spelled it out * was the best of all the actors in this film, when he played a psycho role in Texas Chainsaw 4. With such a bad taste in movies, this is painful. Thank you ... The truth, has spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Get the devil's rejection, and now it's become classy.
