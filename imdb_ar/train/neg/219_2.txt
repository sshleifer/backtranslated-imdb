It may be a good film if you have discovered something more interesting and not just a surface for a lesbian relationship if that is the meaning of the film ... it is highly unlikely that the two girls resemble the Russian Tatu group. ..Coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this film to support him so they had to use something already famous. You know the recipe. Other actors ... Well, I do not know what their supposed role is. Most of them are well-known people in Romania, and I must mention that some of them are not representatives (like Mihaila Radulescu). So to sum it up: "band girl comes" + desperate / publicity need to "reps" + person not found plot + suitable to use bad language for shock = sick love .... very bad ... the idea was good, though. .. I seriously stuck myself from the comment to the title ...
