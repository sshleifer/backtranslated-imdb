I grew up watching the original Batman Animated Series, and I am an amateur collector of Batman novels. With the legendary comic book hero like Batman, there are some features that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when their personality changes completely, they are very far away. I have purchased one of the seasons "The Batman" in the hope that an additional feature can shed some light on the justifications of the creators to make such a show such brutal acts. "We felt we should not mess with Batman, but we can fool the bad guys," said one of the artists, or the book (I'm not sure). So, they began to make Joker an immature young child begging attention, Penguin in some knockoff decorations, and Mr. Bob Kane is rolling in his grave. <br /> <br /> To summarize everything: I wish I had more hands so I could give this four-thumb display down. He is squeezed through my rankings with 2 out of 10 because he simply uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... rethink this! Please!
