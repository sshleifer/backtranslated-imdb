I bought this movie for 1 euro, and I did not know what was going on around it. I thought "Hmmm, a film called Distortion Man Should Be If Not Too Funny At Least Filled With Gore." It was not funny okay. It was annoying. Very troublesome. I do not mind disturbing movies, but this film does not mean anything, but child abuse is not a good thing. Hmmm ... the quality of the pictures was awful. Representation ... There was no representation. Just some fcked-up fcker distortion itself for more than 90 minutes. This is likely to be a substance for jogging that afflicts the patient in the severe bull. <br /> <br /> You do not see this. Not worth your time. It's just awful. I hope I never buy this. <br /> <br /> They must mutilate the man who made this
