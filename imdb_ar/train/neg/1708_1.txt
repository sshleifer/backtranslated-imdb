Well, I do not have much to say about this film, unlike this: I've watched more than 4,000 movies in my life, and more than 2300 horror films. Although I have some difficulties in determining the best (unlike my favorites, which I can tell you is the dawn of George A. Romero Fajr), I can tell you without hesitation that the zombie Blodbath is Todd Chaud. The worst horror film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Simply, there is nothing positive I can say about this movie. Representation, dialogue, direction, make-up, music ... Every aspect of this film is simply much less than it is acceptable that it puzzles me in my mind that it has been released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a complete horror or zombie movie, please pay attention to my warning and do not waste your time on this trash. It is not a pleasure to have gotten out of this show. You will not even get a laugh of absolute uncertainty on the screen ... trust me. Please.
