This movie has many related problems that make it start like a low budget category project from someone in a film school. I should give it credit for its attractiveness though. Several times throughout the film I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad sometimes that it was a comedy, which made it an enjoyable hour. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a film with a low degree of knockout with a twist of psychological horror and a ridiculous rush. , Then a bowl of popcorn pops up, make some friends, and enjoy each other. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. The next impossible dialogue to follow a lot of time and soundtrack is kind of out there just.
