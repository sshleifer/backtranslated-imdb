If you want to watch a movie about two totally unfriendly characters, this is the movie. The acting is wonderful, both from John Cassavet as a mad paranoia who, as the saying goes, are really on their way out, and Peter Falk is his best lifelong friend and resort to salvation. Big mistake, but since they are both unethical mobs and scoundrels who hate to take off, it is difficult to determine who should reach LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could have gotten rid of this. I thought it was interesting that in a lengthy interview with the producer Michael Houseman on the DVD, he revealed that the stars had "very different ideas" about the script, and the director was almost impossible to work with, and that the director of photography was impossible demands, that The crew was constantly angry from sitting down to sit waiting, and so on. This mood of one very large dysfunction family comes across clearly on the screen.
