If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a pimp for New York Street, or John Wayne as a Communist spy, you might think that Pat Boone was a delinquent at his uncle's farm in Kentucky, and you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is so stupid that he was not modest in a sexless love story in the mid-1950s. The problem is that Hollywood committed such a big deal about the refusal of Pat Boone to kiss a woman and not his wife on the screen before her release that the public knows he will not accept Shirley Jones so you can not build any expectation of "screen completion" of their love. It's like watching a West where cowboys do not have guns. <br /> <br /> The story is useless. Even the title song sings with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst set of films with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
