Sure, Zu Warriors should have been an animated series because it's like watching old anime on acid. The movie just starts out of nowhere and people start fighting around with metal wings and other stupid weapons until the princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something. If this princess is a god or an angel out of my speed, but soon this bad guy comes flying and kills her while the barbed-winged man fights some other thing from God / Satan / wizard magician The line of conspiracy either does not exist or is very difficult to follow, Need to be insanely smart to get this movie. The plot will soon follow this Chinese human being called by this god to fight wicked evil, kill the evil princess and soon our Uwe Boll scene is very badly designed like a complete fighting scene with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. Even strange visual images may be said to be amazing and colorful but I will say that they are foggy and acid trip like (yes that's a word!) I've seen both the names and translations of them both were very bad and hard to understand .... Who I joking I did not understand at all. I felt like I was watching episode 30 of the 1980 film Anime and I totally lost how I started the story or the like, and started reading a comic series of 5 in Issue 4 because I had no idea how to start this thing where it was going or how it would end. All the time. I can honestly say that this was one of the worst film experiences ever, it was like watching Ino Yasha's episode 134 drunk ... yes that's true because you do not know what the hell is going on. The brain is trying to figure out this.
