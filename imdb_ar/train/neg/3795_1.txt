I really wanted to love this show. I did it honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers get their own "Bachelor" version. With the assistance of Andra, James, a person of good looks and well-being enjoys a good chance with 15 of the hijackers (or "their colleagues" as referred to in the show). The only problem is that half of them running and James does not know it. If James chooses a gay person, he will get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses a straight person, the straight man gets $ 25,000. How can this not be fun? Take my hand, let's walk around: <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem in this exhibition is the bachelor itself. James is a successful and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, a person who is likely to give him a quick look at the local pub before grazing in search of green grasslands. Why they chose to cast James as a leading man is beyond my control. God knows that there are so many hottest and hilarious gay men who die to be on television. <br /> <br /> Regardless of his average physical appearance, James is as interesting and impressive as a piece of chalk. Even so, he has this arrogant arrogance thirsty for him. However, if James stands against an empty white wall, it is merged into it. I honestly can not remember one interesting or noteworthy thing James said during the show. It is dull and forgotten. In fact, one of his apartment colleagues advised that he did not feel contact. I thought this was the best part of the show. Also, James speaks uncomfortably irritatingly. It sounds feminine or masculine sound, but no **** ing segue tones in the middle of sentences ... very painful to sit. I hated him so much throughout the show, I kept thinking, "Please choose a straight man and insult yourself and your desperate need" <br /> <br /> Then we have the suitors. A wonderful group of men who do not seem to care in either case what happens. Equally important, they seem to be indistinguishable from one person to another except "Hey this guy has blond highlights or ya that has curly hair" Again, it seems that the inconclusive decisions in making decisions are the goal of this show. Although it may be hacked to write cast roles, it was better to see more of those drones. However, in all their vanities, they are still able to withstand James (which is not difficult to do anyway), a little. You know that you have a problem when some of the hijackers are already hotter and more interesting than the leading guy. And the fact that the kidnappers seem to be more fun at all than with the leading guy? very sad. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the ID point is something that is mentioned in the message boards that I felt were really real: straight men are hotter than gay men. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that all homosexual men were ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very nice. In general, they were just BLAH compared to men you see in programs like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times you've made it fast forward during this show. I can accept a special character such as a cardboard box, and I can accept non-dutiful worldly kidnappers but for the love of God, enjoy me a little bit. There is no such luck. <br /> <br /> If you anticipate a drama, plot, sexual attraction, or excitement, you will be very disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still has a friend in New York (how scandal!). Although I may guarantee you this, this is the only thing remotely resembling any conflict in this offer. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is a twist, but if you have any manifestation of Gaydar Vic, you will easily recognize who (which was not hard at all, I've been wrong only once.) This show is stacked a lot Of his flakes in the twist that he failed to deliver elsewhere. <br /> <br /> We are committed to watching James & Co plod alongside these exciting activities like learning how to dance a western step, shopping for gifts, visiting a pet park, and gay karaoke. Yawning. Make sure you enjoy dancing from time to time but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems in the show: it seems that no one enjoys himself - there just goes through the movement trying hard to appear good. And you really can not blame them because all events are not hideous and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical side does not exist. No cuddling, no foreplay, no kissing (!), No granulation of any kind. It's just "Well, it's been a boring history, I'm going to go back to my ugly place, which I want to be Sidney Oprahhouse (CYA)." This show is very cool. I can understand that they do not want to play the role of the randomized nature of gay men, but come on. People who watch reality TV shows will want more of hugs and kisses. This proposal rejects concessions. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this has ended for a long time but I felt that these issues need to be addressed. I commend Bravo for the first time to show such a show, but the amazingly inefficient way in which this show was run is mind boggling. To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = go Do something else. You'll have more fun waiting in the doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have exciting magazines out there.
