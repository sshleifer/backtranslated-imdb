I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad .... bad, bad and bad. There is no conspiracy. It's like watching a boring, boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy his other films ...... but if you're a fan of me like me, stay away from this movie. May change your thoughts on Adam. You may never recover from the horror of this movie .... I have spent a better time watching old people playing in their home .......
