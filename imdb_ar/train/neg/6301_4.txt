Despite the excellent work done by the supporting actors, and the brilliant text by Alan Blatter, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the character / lead actor. One character describes the character of Richard E. Grant as "small feces" and, unfortunately, sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make him a friend and his support / publisher / friend of the upper class will spend a lot of time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructing and completely disquieting. Calling the part to a representative can make you love him even when he is a stranger - for example, Ioan McGregor. <br /> <br /> Smart spellings have been wasted on the separation system and so on, thanks to this annoying and totally undesirable performance. All I wanted to do was get rid of it and tell it to overcome itself.
