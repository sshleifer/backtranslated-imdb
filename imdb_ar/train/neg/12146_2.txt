The scary zombie film tries to be evil and shocked, but feeding the crowds comes lame because some tough zombies chase the streets. In Rhode Island, the zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is being minimized by the government that manipulates newspapers and television stations. Some brave, but stupid, souls in Channel 5 of News News feel that their audience is getting the wrong hope and no idea what the real danger is. Racheal Morris and her photographer, William Garberina, with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk life and limb to live broadcast to show the agony at hand. Do yourself a favor and do not see. Obviously this is a very low budget thing and comes with a sense of play in high school theater. Representation is horrible and the body-hungry zombies are almost comic. Also featured: Michael Prober, William Dickoff and Brenda Hogan. Feeding the masses should be left to starve.
