This makes the movie Errol Morris III that I have seen, and I do not like his style increasingly. He seems to find very interesting and diverse characters, and great characters to create documentaries, then with the tongue-free editing in his cheek making fun of everything that goes on around him. It's really not a direct caricature of them and Morris seems to say most of the time: "But no, no, these people are really great, really!" , But there are always these small hidden binding angles and non-hidden editing. The techniques show that Morris seems to be mocking behind their backs. <br /> <br /> This film follows four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... A man who studies African hairless mammals to find them amazing like ants, Tamer al-Assad, a man who keeps a zoo filled with animal shrubs, and a robot designer. It seems that the general theme of the film revolves around the question of what characterizes the features of animal, human and life? So it does not seem that the title Fast, Cheap, & Out-Control means something in terms of film ... right? Except, of course, Morris seems a little annoyed by the feelings of these individuals (they may be called "concerns") who design artificial designs for life. I do not share this fear, and frankly I do not appreciate some of Morris' links in the film. <br /> <br /> But I stress its accuracy. With no narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewers, it is not as if Maurice showed this concern at the head of the collective spectator. Instead, circus clips and ant shots often blend together sometimes when they are taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all these people are talking about. I do not find them ridiculous, I find them all very neat and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he did not mean such complications, which means he is just a bad craftsman instead of a silent conspirator. Given that none of these films I have seen so far have been particularly affected, I do not really care to know what they are trying to do. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
