This movie is quite bad for Friday 13th. The film is about a murderer named Bernie killing people around a training camp for camp membership. He kills people because the training camp of the camp counselor is on land owned by his father. When the police came to take his fathers by force, they accidentally killed his mother (another F13 took off). The introduction is Bernie's vision of killing his first victims. Then we met a family walking in the same forest. Shortly after they arrived, a strange old man who liked to talk about his son joined them. Later we learned that his son Bernie had locked him in the back of his caravan after being taken out of a mental institute. Bernie was appointed after the family so they could take their belongings and then the chase was on. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended only for those who enjoy Class B weapons.
