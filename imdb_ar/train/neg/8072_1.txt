(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Survivors Soul" may be the worst movie ever made. Nothing is logical at all, there is some conspiracy about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not have died. The entire movie is just a collection of random shots of objects that do not connect to each other, at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The representation does not exist, the camera action is choppy and the script is very confusing, it makes watching the movie even harder. To link the movie together but nothing came. Definitely the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
