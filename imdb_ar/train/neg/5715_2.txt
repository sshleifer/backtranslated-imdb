"Say Yes" is one of those clicks that I still hope to improve, but it did. It is a kind of "mentally unstable decides to threaten the wrestling of the innocent couple", a very lovable video-maker. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is illogical, and in many places, it is poorly translated. The representation is uniformly weak, especially from the wicked piece, played by Jung Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not flashing and trying to speak with a deep voice it makes his character look threatened, while all he really does is make it seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention because it is stupid beyond belief. The "heroes" do not think it is strange that the hikers threaten to kill them. The heroine twice managed to miss the sight of the villain when he was not more than a foot away from her. The villain passes through a police checkpoint (while wearing a bloodied shirt and a bloody headband) by showing the burned-out police body in the passenger seat of his car. The villain is pierced, beaten with a shovel and hit by a spoon, but does not seem to hinder these serious injuries. And do not make me start this terrible "evolution". Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only additional point in this film, to me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful, but really is not more than just a modest actress. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is like a badly written, poorly represented attempt to copy "Hitcher" and "Spoorloos", but fails at every turn because of the lack of talent of all concerned.
