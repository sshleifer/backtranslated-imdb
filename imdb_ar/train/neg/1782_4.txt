The charming boy and his mother move into the middle of a town with nowhere to go, followed by cats and death. It's about assembling it. <br /> <br /> I will confess that I am worried about cats after seeing this movie. But all seriously, despite the many wrong things in this film, believe me that there is a lot to do, it is a very enjoyable viewing experience in general. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here with instincts based solely on dependence. It seems that fear or greed or lust for pride or anger is all that motivates these people. Although it can be said that this apparent failure, in fact, serves to recount the story. The supernatural hypothesis and the fact that it is Stephen King's scenario (and I have nothing specific against Mr. King) are well supported by some interesting FX works, makeup and music that are perfectly appropriate. The jewel of this film is undoubtedly Alice Craig who plays the role of Mary Brady, the other exotic mother. <br /> <br /> King is able to take a simple story about a strange person, or slightly different people (well - a lot in this case), trying to fit and turn him into a camp on top of the little horror jewel that must be in the collection of Lovers of horror.
