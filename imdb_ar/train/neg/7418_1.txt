Oh God, from a terrible film. Is supposed to be a comment on the state of society, it is just a reflection of the worst worst reality television. The interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don MacKillard are the most reprehensible part, written in a tone that may be reflective and insightful. Instead, these moments are startling when you talk to the camera through a dialogue someone writes with the love of insult and harmonious speech that mocks the "meaning" of the film down the shaved scenes. <br /> <br /> Also, a point for potential directors: long scenes and tranquility are not worth the art. No extreme angles or absurd logic. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not. seriously. Please. You have better to do.
