Well, the writing was very dirty, the output was more fragile, and editing made the order worse (at least I hope it would be editing). The representation was not bad, but it was not good either. Pretty much none of the characters loved. At least 45 minutes of this film was wasted time and did not use the other clock or so anywhere near its full potential. It was a great idea, but another good idea was lost. It may have ended up in 3 different places, but it eventually ended in Hollywood. What was unpredictable was so bad that it did not matter. The end was not worth seeing at all. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and had to stay away from these types of films. The movie also seemed to be rushed. The movie was not really worth watching, and I had paid for it to have been so crazy. Maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good film and got a bad movie. The film was not so bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea a lot and I was impressed by one character (Justin I think, super personality intelligence). It also had some very cheap ways to cover the conspiracy holes. It was like trying to cover a volcano with a cheap adhesive tape, it was not nice. However, if you watch it, wait for the $ 1.50 theater or video, unless you love every movie you watch so much, I think you'll like it.
