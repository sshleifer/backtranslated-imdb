This is the kind of film you regret in VCR. It has some odd rip-off version of Steven Kings' film "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this film got 5.2 degrees, because it has no story at all, and when the film finally finished, I was relieved. Instead .. a lot of time is spent on the same thing. As in every bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie in 10 to 15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in Remote control, because you will do a lot of quick rerouting ... Do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
