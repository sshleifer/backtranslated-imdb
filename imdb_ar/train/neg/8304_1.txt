"The Christmas Story" is one of the most popular movies by many people. ACS managed to move the viewer to a time and place in a way that had very few films. She had sweetness and good faith for her and this is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) to complete "It Runs In The Family". The movie was released almost several times, just to be pulled at the last minute. When I finally came out, IRITF (and I think) was a huge failure. <br /> <br /> The groups and cinematography were fine, but the output was completely absent, completely missed the mark. The film was more than a formula for cash flows from slow laziness, slow writing, and separate representation. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Sheppard, who was one of America's leading thinkers and storytellers, had a false surprise of the warm wit he used in ACS. He was very sensitive, and why did he do that I would never know him. He somehow managed to become a disturbing and disturbing parody of himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and behaving in IRITF is incorrect and compelling. Actors may have seen ACS, but must not have been recorded on any of them whatever the intelligence and differences that existed in ACS. The acting was an embarrassing jerk and denial of any of the dry Shepard humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but IRITF's sequel is an insult to all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
