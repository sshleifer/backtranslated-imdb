It's one of those typical films for the mtv generation of dance, and I do not see where all this garbage comes from 'non-bad'. Acting is terrible, following the same story as all the other "dance" movies out there. It's terrible! The name should not be shouted. 'How does it move.' How long can titles ignore the grammar rules? At least some of the dance films had half decent dance scenes, these films are not worth watching. I give it 1 out of 10, just because there is zero. I seriously beg anyone who has an IQ of over 60 years not to watch this, and do not waste your money. You should tell 1.6 / 10 everything. This film should not be.
