I spent almost two hours watching a movie I thought with all the good actors in it, worth watching. I could not believe it when the movie ended and I had no idea at all about what happened ..... I was crazy because I had used this time to do something else .... I tried to figure it all out, really had no idea. Thanks to those who understood it and explained it .... Right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the lady in the dark-haired movie that we saw several times as she drove away? How did the First Lady know that her husband was betraying her? At the end of the film Kate said she would finally discover the truth. Does this mean that we will be playing End 2?
