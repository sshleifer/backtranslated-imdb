Demer Davis, a great director when it comes to Westerners, remains a "broken arrow" in everyone's minds. As far as melodrama is concerned, he should leave it to people like Vincent Menelli, George Cuckour or Douglas Circus. The movie scenario is so predicted that you will not be surprised once while watching such a lukewarm wepie. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by the "life tradition" of Fanny Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who was thought to be black. Daughter of the man anyway? Susan Koehner was more credible in the "tradition of life", and Sinatra and Kertis are given parts of stereotypes so they can not do anything with them: the poor officer, the rich sergeant with good looks. Who will Natalie fall in love with? France is a land of tolerance, with inter-ethnic unions warmly welcoming. At the time (around 1944) it was questionable, and still for people with the narrow horizon that you can find here and everywhere.
