There are a lot of terrible mistakes in this picture, starting with a clear and repetitive script. Courtney Cox plays the role of a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She was promptly stolen by a local person who seemed impetuous (Craig Scheffer) and seemed to be trying to imitate Mickey Rourke of the third degree. D.B. Sweeney is a local cop, supposed to be there to protect and serve. At the same time, the text manipulates the audience Who is the really good person? The logic flies out of the window after the first ten minutes and never comes back, and there are too many unanswered questions. If you think "Blue Desert" may be saved by the magnificent Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His role is minimal, just like the entire film. - Merck
