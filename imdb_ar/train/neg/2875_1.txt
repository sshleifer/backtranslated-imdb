This is the biggest piece of crap ever. They seem to have spent more time, effort and money in making a DVD cover than they did in the actual film. I really thought that the DVD had been stopped using a porno by a homemade person until I met a representative from the cover. The film looks like someone made it with hundreds of dollars and a video camera, and spent half that on mice. The picture is really clear, but with very unfortunate lighting, cinema, if you can call it, the production and acting, if this is what they already do, the scenario, if they have one, makes this film seem worse than the old porn. At least the old pornographic has a point. It seems as if some members of PETA have gathered and decided to make a senseless PSA announcement about animal rights and feelings. This is not worth the money or time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the killer name and the name of some victims. The people who made this movie should be happy because it is still free, or maybe it came after them just because the film was so bad.
