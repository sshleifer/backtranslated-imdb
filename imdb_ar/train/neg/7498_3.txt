Spike Lee has been in retreat since his early successes and this mess does not help anything. I looked at my watch hoping that the film would end or reach that point. My first film with a cast full of eggs is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If you want to see Scorsese, I'll go to Scorsese. The wondrous character of the godfather adds incredible only to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I've liked many of my movies, especially "Do the Right Thing." This movie is a waste of time.
