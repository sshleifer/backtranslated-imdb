The original presentation was much better. They should have left a good note. This film killed the whole idea. It was boring, too much drama, and the funny parts were too far from recession. This film really looked like trying hard to be serious, and this certainly was not what I wanted from this series. Not to mention that for a long time it was frustrating about the same thing over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try next time. This movie is just a bit boring, not that funny too. Sorry. 4/10 Stars are. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
