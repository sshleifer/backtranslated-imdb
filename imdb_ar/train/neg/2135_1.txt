Just utter the garbage. I'm a big fan of Cusacks, and that's the only reason I've ever seen this movie, but the only reason I see their presence is to accurately re-represent their roles from Gros Point Planck in full quality and depth. Apart from that, the role of films as political satire fails miserably to be even clearer for the strangest there to serve any purpose. And to make the bill as a satirical satire would be just an insult to the chimpanzees. Tradition seems to be the highest form of flattery, but it seems that this is not near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same period that meets Spartans (see if it is a hurdle) with regard to political cynicism, lets you leave well alone and let this one fade away The ambiguity that he fully deserves.
