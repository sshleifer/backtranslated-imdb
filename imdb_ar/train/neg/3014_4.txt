I recently saw landscapes created at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I am familiar and beloved to the work of Burtynsky. Although I think the film is doing a good job in delivering his message, I could only feel that it was prepared as a complete idea of ​​the photographs and the famous book read by Burtynsky. One of the reasons for this is evidently the intense use of still images in which pinging and pans appear. Although this is a good effect when using it economically, I felt that 75% of the film was just footage from the book Burtynsky (which I already own). Maybe this is an exaggeration, but that's what I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with its work, you may be better off skipping this book.
