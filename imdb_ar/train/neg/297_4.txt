For the record, this film is interesting but hardly original. In 1998, the film starring Talia Shire was titled The Landlady, almost the same plot but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is that Amanda Lear has gone through a bad life, an abusive father, a keratologist and a mental home, who was finally released from the happy home under the direction of a deviant doctor ... who assaults him by accident and kills the poor man. (Now an original) the doctor funded her palace before killing him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After her move, she falls in love with a lover named Richard, who just marries a blues singer. If you have seen The Landlady, you know the rest, they kill or try to kill anyone who enters between them and Richard (including Rudy). <br /> <br /> A lot of ideas came from the previous film, the same foolish assailant who sticks his nose, the same spying on a guy with a pot of popcorn, himself flying on bodypress. He had some original stuff and the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the film was the Amanda Gemayelan breasts in the hot scene. Somewhat of a rip but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
