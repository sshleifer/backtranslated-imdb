The previous part of the film was a little fun, but in the end it became vulgar. Although Turturro is a representative I liked in general, but Lozine was often like a bad impression of a rain man and portraying the genius as a semi-autistic man was troublesome. In general, it seems that this film is trying hard and ends up in spite of mostly good performance.
