This was a film I could not wait for! So finally I was very disappointed. For starters, the film said little about New York, just a bunch of confusing images of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really does not focus on the magic of New York. The other thing that changed my mind is the French film set within this film. I know it is a remake, but it is not a remake of the French way! In any case, you will notice elements here that remind you of French films, such as long scenes, anarchism, or a little talk, and of course everyone smokes in the French style! The story follows many lives (much for my taste) and seems to be somehow linked in the end. I feel that there was no dedication in the characters as much as in the stories. The film was too short to cover every happy fate for everyone. So we can see about 30 people for 5 minutes each. There are 120 minutes! If you love lively viewer dialogues and stuff, this is not the right movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the acting team!
