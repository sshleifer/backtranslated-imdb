This is really a new drop in entertainment. Although there are films much worse. <br /> <br /> In this kind of Gangster / Drug movies, it's hard to get a compelling story (these films are not, I mean the Sebastians' motives for example can not be more cliche and trivial). Prepare credible personal relationships (this film is not). <br /> <br /> Surely Tristan is derived from his family but why was this again? What is the deal with his father again that he must ask permission to get out of his age? An interesting picture though to ask about the lack of need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper class family. But this film does not go in this direction. Although there will be a possible rule by Random Backflash. He was not already down and out, why did he do it again? <br /> <br /> So, there are some exciting questions raised here to get a strong drama from the social critic (but again, this film is not so, given the focus on "brilliant" production techniques and special effects and not giving a moment to reflect them, Most of all, forcing the story on the path they want to be in and not paying attention to letting the story breathe and develop normally. <br /> <br /> It wants to be a drama that does not glorify material misuse and violence (it will be politically incorrect these days , Right?) But on the other hand, nothing more than a cheap motion film (like having a lot of people out there) with an average Jmuah representatives from Vinnie Jones, who can not destroy what remained of his reputation completely by doing what we always do. <br /> <br /> So, I can not recommend this. br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
