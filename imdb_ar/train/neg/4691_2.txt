A real blow to the film literally. This British film was made dull. <br /> <br /> What an intriguing plot! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How can writers and producers in this stink transform this into a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as the expert has called for defusing the bomb, is given terrible writing material to work with. Of course, just as it is called, his wife Anne Vernon is about to leave him. No wonder we have not heard of Miss Vernon. After this film, it will be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> This old man who loves trains and intervenes is the 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was too humiliating to show this guy, even in the end.
