My roommate got the soundtrack "No, No, Nanette" as a knock on the bar, and proceeded to listen to it nonstop. After his brain finally immersed me in submission, I found that the songs are irresistible, especially the famous song, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But from the coarse of the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it in the video store and hired what was supposed to be a long lost copy of the movie. I was thinking that it would be great, because the soundtrack is very nice. Unfortunately, most of the songs you liked were not found in the video you watched. Now I did not see the music version of 1930, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there was very little singing and practically do not dance, and besides the sound was so bad outside and you could not understand what people really say a lot of time. The most striking feature of this film was the terrible fashion that emerged in 1940. "Nanette" wears this crazy hat with Reeshen swaying like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty had this exotic alien from the feathers she kept on her forearm and then worn herself in this The net veil. The sequence of the single dance is also a bit strange with Nanette making this strange ballet with the pictures of a girl installed above it. In fact, another bright spot in the film was the artist Gillespie, who dreams of being a great artist, but is now sentenced to painting young girls for money. I love the way Gillis keeps it in her old school, and it's different from Nanette when Nanette is sold by his piece, a piece of his career, for $ 5250. Do not you realize that that piece was his immortality? A silly rabbit / girl with rabbit feather ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why not just do a pencil in a cigarette before men take advertising work?
