Magnolia presents itself as a cloth on the wall of yelling, screaming, over-carcasses and hysterical nausea who feel remorse and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a talented filmmaker, but he may have to leave writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him that he needs to adjust this long mess. <br /> <br /> A look at the cast tells you that the performances were excellent and were. I hope that not every spectacle will include a high screaming match or a long elongation in the sins committed and the pain it caused. <br /> <br /> I also think that Anderson failed miserably to create a story parallel to the alien paintings that open the film. The opening sequence is wonderful in showing how the destiny can bring people together and the conditions that even the most optimistic believers in a global client pull our strings will make fun of them. But the story that has evolved later lacks any of the things that these opening myths offer. I was waiting for some kind of cosmic convergence to appear, but instead, all we got were waves of regret from morally challenged characters who saw their past spreading before them and now seeking absence. The throw of the evangelical plague outside the left field is near the end, and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson fans who will marvel at his genius when he truly proves that he has already read the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> I will say that Amy Man's music was great and I will look for an audio CD. In short, a good movie can be seen and listened to (ie music) if the actors will vote or soften the sound perhaps
