A group of two-dimensional psychological thugs are being assaulted on an obnoxious woman and an equally obnoxious man by a group of two-dimensional psychic thugs during a night encounter in a forest road in Shropshire, England. The men and women who have been attacked are planning and carrying out a retaliatory attack on the attackers ... <br /> <br /> He has completely chased a piece of littering junk, disguised as one of the most "provocative" dramas, while actually coming through a sub-Michael Winner cr * p (You know perfectly well that Oliver Reid and Susan George would have been dumped if they were made easily in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is shocking and devastating, but Dan Reid is somehow able to rub the nose of the viewer in every last hate of his sexual hatred. He leaves his camera hungry on the naked body of Anderson during and after the assault, while the text leaves almost all characters wandering in a harsh sea composed of two-dimensional cliches. His text forces his characters to behave in a way that alienates the viewer from the "victims" by pushing more horrific situations to their faces (Adams' attempts after Sophie and Alice's assault; Alice's attack on Hever after his suicide - a confession attempt). <br /> <br /> The impasse comes from the central hero shows - Dyer is a terrible actor, unable to light and shadow as a young male victim of the initial assault (he will end up in the Eastenders, select my words), but Anderson is unusual. Although the horrific text forces its character to behave in corrupt and ridiculous ways, it presents in one way or another an unusually attractive and complex description, as an arrogant and arrogant writer who addresses such atrocities and needs revenge. <br /> <br /> The film is mean and meaningless, but almost is not saved by an attractive female performance.
