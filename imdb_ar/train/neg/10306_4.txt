After watching dozens of episodes, I decided to give up this show because it depicted in an unrealistic way what mathematical modeling is. In episodes in which Charlie predicted future behavior for individuals using mathematical models, I thought my career was a joke. I'm not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I'm going to try to explain to the average person why the show is close to "believing" fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict a position is a daunting task. Charlie Eppes shows up as a genius, but he has to spend a lot of time looking for a suitable model, specifically to try and guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are wrong and random, there is no modeling for them. Even Isaac Asimov wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there is a model for a particular type of individual, it will be a probabilistic model, meaning that it has a good chance of making a wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, assume that the appropriate form for someone or position is found, the form parameters must be known. These parameters are constants of equations, such as gravitational acceleration (9.8 m / s 2), and are often easy to identify. Again, Charlie Ibs must be someone who goes beyond his genius to know the correct criteria for the model he chooses. After selecting the form and parameters, they should be tested. Strangely, it is not, and miraculously, it fits well with the position that is being predicted. Third, the most important aspect of models is not always overlooked, not only by numbers, but also by science films -fi: the arithmetic effort required to solve these models. Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find hard work. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve its models, it may be stuck on devices that will be very slow. Even with the right suite of software / hardware, it may take days to reach the model. He solves them instantly! I use my computer in my research work, and I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it is not the best show. The characters are rather moldy, but they are not remotely funny like those in Big Bang Theory. The blunders and the way Charlie does sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent. <br /> <br /> For an ordinary person, the offer may succeed. For others, the way things are handled makes it hard to swallow!
