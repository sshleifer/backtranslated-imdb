I took the TRAN SCAN from the library and took it home. We thought about making a trip to the East, and we thought it would give us a sense of what it was like. The movie was a waste of time completely, if I went out to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw the cost was $ 49. <br /> <br /> He ran a DVD for 8 minutes and showed a trip to the roller coaster all over Canada with my stomach feeling sick as he climbed up and down the curve with the movie at high speed. <br /> <br /> There were lots of shots they might have taken on this subject, and you thought they could make a better product. If you have done this project, you have made more stills, paused on road signs to let people know where they are and stay in places to see the scenery. To make such a film, it should be 60 to 90 minutes. Yes, yes, the case said it was smooth, and the entire film was a silent sound from the sound of the car, and at least some music could be put on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good film through Canada, watch The Railroader / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster Keaton (one of his last films) in this comedy film Buster Keaton, In Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
