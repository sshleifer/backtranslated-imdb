"It's hard to describe such a description of how exciting it is to have a relationship like drama with all the pornographic scenes like that being put up in such a good scale as, to provoke like contro-like-and-makey more like money and like things." - Ellen, citation missing. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, admiring, admiring, mouthing and things" is like artistic endeavor as it has ever been. Watching like Ellen's arms and Chris's masturbation was the culmination of my long experience of watching movies and things. But before I would like to start breaking the new US-20 air-cap records with "Likes", let me just put a short list as positive as the highlights of this visual feast: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does the act with His genitals. And not only that: the way the camera is rewarded (elegantly directed by Eileen and Patrick), seen through a full shot of crisp white crispy casserole after he finished the non-Catholic work, was really exciting. I can honestly say I have not seen such grace. Chris, you have to do more of these scenes in your upcoming movies, because that's exactly what we need as a continuation of what this brilliant and brilliant man, Lars von Trier and "Idiots 95" started. W fast, then a white belly hairy, fleshy, what can any of the movie pioneers ask?! Needless to say, I sit all day watching Chris tossing (despite the fact that I'm straight) ... like this hair in motion. This elegance, like this style. At least all, divine inspiration went into portraying this sequence - in addition to a great deal of Zen philosophy. Even Barbara Streisand could not get more spirituality than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hair, thick arms. Vibrant camera shots, skillfully filmed by our directors of photography (I can not stress enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion about the proper identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes when we saw part of an object (leg, arm or foot), yet it was often a guess toy: Does this part of the body belong to a man or a woman? It is natural that Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen and Patrick and the user name, cast themselves intentionally, because their bodies were perfect for creating this gender-based confusion. It was sometimes difficult to guess whether a person saw a male or female leg. Patrick is very thin and spreads in his movements, very stiff and early, while Ellen and the other girl are very vulgar, including their legs and legs and arms. brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Fantastic - especially the way they are closely linked with the theme of gender roles reversal: completely original and mind-boggling. Ellen behaves like a man and wants to have sex all the time, while Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Find Elaine about a left-wing companion. "He should love the Simpsons, and he is quite leftist." I am happy that the makers of this film have decided to break the long tradition of presenting clever leftists. Ellen is a refreshing and realistic change. The number of "hits" that she and her liberal friends managed to utter in less than 80 minutes is a truly phenomenal number (3849, to be precise). They have been able to convey realistically unrealistic real life to the big screen with minimal effort, and I salute them for that. 5. Closeup of the toes. A lot of things here for the makers of football, which I think is a very liberal and highly commendable way to reach sexual minorities. After all, little makers of shoes and feet are introduced into modern cinema, so it's good to see that there is someone who cares. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than the eye sees. It is not just a simple, modest film about shallow people who engage in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations. No, it's much more. It is about the light that directs all the silly creatures. Directed light that dominates the futile life of many false artistic wishes that have just come out of the cinema school and are planning to attack our senses with a combination of low-spirited leadership that we hope will play well in festivals such as Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to gain the necessary exposure and Here are some real money for change, which will later hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the rescue of this planet and solving all the political problems facing this world. What is the best way to do this from making porn at first? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Elaine had the camera here, as clearly stated in the final points, who carried the camera while the two were in front of it? Maybe they hired some passers-by and pushed the camera into their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateeyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Cases" from the list of nepotism.
