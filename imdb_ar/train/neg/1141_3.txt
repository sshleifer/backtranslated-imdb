After expectations were low, the new footage (recorded in more than five minutes) for "Husbands" was a pleasant surprise. I would not say that the new footage was a first-class material, but it provided a solid basis for what "could have been" a very good film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film was assembled in 1955, one of the shooting schedules today. After the new footage, Jules White decided to put a brief footprint for Bridesless Groom in this short story, making the story unfinished, which Jules and Felix Adler are trying to tackle with a few new shots at the end, giving us the old worn-out end of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) They shoot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
