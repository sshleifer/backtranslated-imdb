I doubt that this will be even a cult film. I loved being a Parsons Gram sure and I did not expect much from this movie and got less. What could have been intelligent and moving was campy. It was free of gram-made music and was stuffed with more than cheap dog food. There was no background about the gram or colored people of that era. The characters I was introduced to were not even familiar to me as Gram fans and all the versions of "The Adventures of the Afterlife" I heard. Rock & Roll is full of tales, good stories too, but must be taken with salt. They can be wonderful stories, though exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and turned into a tripe. It should not be stealing any corpse and the consequent tedious tale but it made it dull, somehow. I tend to steal every copy of the Grand Theft Parsons, head to the desert and burn them all.
