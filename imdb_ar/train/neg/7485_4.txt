Granted, this sounds like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hoon, and John Cleese in the comedy film Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll discover it. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, the lead, is incorrect. He does not play with his famous "The Jerk", but instead plays some kind of character that does not work. Mortar, with no one to play outside, is terrible. Cleese is the only funny member in part. <br /> <br /> For the first time, the plot is very stupid. I can not say how much has changed, but the characters seem to lack a little common sense. They make mistakes in New York, they do not do anything right, and unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only is the entire logic entirely believable, it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, it is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In the summary, instead to see this, go rental the original "odd couple" again.
