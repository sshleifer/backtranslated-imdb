Jennifer Cacy (Gina Phillips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house where she grew up and inherited from her deceased sister, without the knowledge of her grandmother (Faye Donawi), who still lives there. Jennifer decides to sell her because she desperately needs a lot of money for grandma's grandmothers. She also began to suffer from the annoying recurring nightmares of the mysterious crow. There was no one in this film. Jennifer looked cool and distant, unemotional and narcissistic, while the grandmother looked sad, sad and narcissistic too. The film is good and well-made, but with no one sympathizing with him, I found it hard to pay attention to what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C-
