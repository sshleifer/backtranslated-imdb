This film is the perfect adaptation of the English language Flick unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Amran and the role of Olivier and Malca, the role of the ideal cheating wife Lin. They changed the second half of the film to adapt to Indian audiences. <br /> <br /> Even so, the film got the full effects of the unfaithful, although it could not catch up with the original. It was a soft, cheap bouquet for Bollywood lovers, where Malika showed more skin than anyone dared to show. Omran performed more roles like this and was even called the serial killer. In the future if Indian directors intend to reproduce an English-language film, they should look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian sergeant. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors received an undue confession. In the future, directors must be more careful in reproducing an Oscar nomination film. <br /> <br /> He said all this, it's not a family movie, so take extra care while watching at home with the family.
