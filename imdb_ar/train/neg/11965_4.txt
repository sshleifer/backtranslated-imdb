The historical Kajos is particularly interested in this specific historical event, and I was very disappointed with the film. Admittedly, the costumes and styles were perfectly original, but Hollywood photography of this "Great Little British Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of footage for military or military forces must be unprecedented. In the history of the film. After hearing that winning background music began, I knew I had to prepare myself for another hard scene of meaningless stuffing. It is clear that the producers invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to get the value of their money. <br /> <br /> Despite their wonderful acting, their dialogue was once more boring and their personalities were never developed. Whenever Peter Ontol or Bert Lancaster finished a scene, I was dealing with disappointment. Their particular lines were so weak and meaningless that I hardly believe that these were the great actors that depicted Lawrence of Arabia and the Alcatraz, respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse seals, but this one is not much better.
