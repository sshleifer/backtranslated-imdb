I and my friends hired this for a "bad night movie" with great hope, but the Brian was a bit of a disappointment. Brain himself looks great, but mostly sits only on his small platform. Who would have thought it would be nice for the brain to get only three people in 94 minutes long? This film contains a number of things to be put forward, including Estevez-knockoff, who plays a rebellious genius. (We are told that his vast mind is being misdirected into his mazes and amazing schoolwork, which involves putting a fake glue on someone's chair ). It also has some great lines, an extraordinarily outlandish and wonderful breath that barely manages to be ubiquitous, and yes, some chick gets naked. However, the director badly needs some education in the art of speed. During the latter half, things start to go on, with at least 3 or 4 boring chase scenes, which make up the middle third of the plot. The viewer inside the PRI complex is very poor. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairs. I was able to fix the scenario in this thing in half an hour of cheese, more bull, more nudity, more cerebral movement. If you're going to make a horror movie, give me at least something great to look at while turning off superego. Perhaps the director was really trying to attract the audience to his film - I began to feel like one of the troubled country residents by the end of this clown.
