It's pretty surreal what these flies can do ... well ... this is a caricature, so anything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> At first, I must tell you that I like animated movies. Unfortunately this year's ammunition is very weak. These drawings are just a list of drawbacks: <br /> <br /> 1) You quoted the tag line. Indicates that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I have not seen anything, at least not something special I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie does not look like real flies. At least they can make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant headers and tiny trunk? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for kids 6 years old. I can say it in two sentences that it has been simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive nationalism. For example: "It's US files after all!" I need a break.
