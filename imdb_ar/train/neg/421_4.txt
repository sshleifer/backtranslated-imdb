My name above says everything. Let me make it clear. If you've seen the BBC's "Planet Earth", and I'm sure most of you have done it, you do not like this movie very much. I own all the "Planet Earth" discs I've seen in this film's rating so high, and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and started the movie, and I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies including BBC and Discovery. When they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I got to know them from my DVDs at Planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The film continued and continued, and I and my friends kept learning about the scenes that were all from Planet Earth. <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed, because I think 90% of the footage is from Planet Earth. I say 90%, because some scenes I did not know. I have a feeling that I simply did not remember them. <br /> <br /> So, finally what this movie really is, is a collection of different shots of different discs of "Planet Earth", with a narration aimed at children. Yes, the narration is very childish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubes moving away from the mother cub, the narrator says, "Polar cubs are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but so). This is the abbreviated "Planet Earth" for children!
