After I saw the first ten episodes, I have to say that this offer sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that the show was filmed in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have picked it up in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. It could have been more honest for the film. The first scene where they are out in another world is in the mountains, where there are many kinds of small pins where they look cool. Do not feel very Egyptian. What worked well in the film was how you felt in ancient Egypt. Here it seems like they are running fighting foreigners in a Canadian jungle. It is so lame that unexpectedly, on other planets, falls also fall. You can see the leaves on the ground in the woods that all look like forests outside of Vancouver. It only makes the presentation more believable and deaf. <br /> <br /> Then there is Richard Dean Anderson. It's not Kurt Russell. He certainly does a decent job and tries to copy Russell's performance a bit, but it's not as wonderful as Russell. Not nearly as good a representative as Russell. The Russells method of playing Neil O, well was more ironic. Anderson Neil, is a very soft way. I liked that Russels' version did not give a picture, and he had no problem blowing up the bomb until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job like Jackson despite taking over from James Spiderman. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. It is Jaffa. Not Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, has only appeared in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c talks and acts like a robot. I have seen the best representation of Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> The fact that Teal'c and Ra's character and the people who saved him in the film, suddenly incredible is also dumb. What made foreigners very scary in the film is that they speak an old language and they were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good in the demo version. But the very rare effects in the actual display are poorly done and look cheap. Especially the planet they visit with crystals. They are obviously wandering around on stage with a badly made panel in the background. It's an insult to our viewers that they made it look very cheap. Especially when they could make it in front of a blue screen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> X files had better effects when their first episodes were broadcast in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. They did not have a clear budget of $ 2 million per ring, which was supposed to be owned by SG-1. They must spend all the money on food. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and unbelievable show would have been great if they had shot the Hollywood show with a bigger budget, better writers and better characters.
