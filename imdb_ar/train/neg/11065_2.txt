This film has a lot of potential. Everyone who followed Jeffrey's story knows that there are so many details that have been overlooked in this film, it's ridiculous. Much of the time and effort in the film has been spent on homosexuality and alcohol consumption. Where was the evolution of personality? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where does the movie take place in a teenager when he began to kill and maim small animals? Instead, we give an amazing array of past memories that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but we fail to address the key point in Dahmer's evolution. The reason why the country was fascinated by this story was the details - how he stored the corpses in his apartment, the lengths and procedures he went to do; cannibals and his desire for meat, etc., but in short, many of the late points in the film, His sexual activity is not enough of the good things - the good things that you would expect to see when the movie title is "Dahmer".
