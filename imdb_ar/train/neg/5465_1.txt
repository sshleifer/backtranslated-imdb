This film has a special place in my heart as the worst film I have ever seen. It's fun like hard manual labor with cramps in the stomach. The film starts badly (I'll make the first few minutes of the film on 1/10) and then it gets worse, minute by minute. The only way to classify them at all is a kind of deep, passive number that grows for 90 minutes long. Ununny is not a real word but describes humor in this video. Somehow, the video runs until it makes the female cute and low-looking and sex seem angry and disliked. This film is surprisingly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked up with a TITANIC theme that plays over and over again with a Buscemi character from ESCAPE FROM LA that you watch in your ear instead of watching this movie. The sequel is not nearly as bad. If you have to rent Troma, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. Best watch 5 Little Tony publications again instead of watching NUKEM HIGH again. Do not get me, it took a kind of criminal genius to film such a terrible film, and if a film deserves an award because it's suspicious, that's all.
