Although it is too early to say how the chain will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be. There is still a possibility for this series, however. Of course when I saw Voyager for the first time I thought it had potential too - but I was very disappointed. Tell me that the institution will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> As for the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good ideas topics. I liked the introduction credits were opening the exhibition interesting, with the progress of exploration and theme song appropriate. Scott Bacola is excellent as captain. <br /> <br /> Where it was short for me was pretty much that the story lacked the "sensation" of embarking on a great adventure. The plot itself was a "general" story of the voyages with the themes of Exploration and the First Step into Space, just a sub-plan and a subtext. If you edit signals to be the first mission in deep space, it will be difficult to distinguish between Enterprise, TOS, or TNG ages. The central plot did not reflect or compromise the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot to launch the first mission was large enough without "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploration, this could have been the story. Get more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that would make us think again). We got excited by the "wind" and being on the "sea" instead of diverting our attention by rescue and a large number of firearms. There were a lot of shootings. <br /> <br /> We had a feeling that humans are "novices" in a school list. New children on the block, rather than venture into a world largely unknown. Unfortunately, Clingons landed on our doorstep rather than find it. This meeting could have been more historic and much more social. How do two different societies interact? Do not just give a hint, but show it! <br /> <br /> I had to think of it as a "journey with a crew and limited technology" instead of "the first brave steps in the unknown." I wanted to see something new and fresher. This series is a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new and great concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude by repeating the feeling that the chain has potential. There are some interesting characters. The gorgeous Bacola Blalock has the ability. The general theme is the most interesting since we saw Kirk for the first time in the world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes are able to redress this great and wonderful subject, we will have a show that will create new legends. /> You can launch an arrow in the air ... Good Luck, Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> For producers: Take more risks and make us * Think *! :-)
