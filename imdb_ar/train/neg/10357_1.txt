I did not really like this film because it did not bring the messages and ideas that L'Engle produced in her novel. We read the novel in the English class and loved it completely, and I'm afraid I can not say the same thing about the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the modified version, and it did not lead to the genius of Madeleine Lengel. That is why I gave this poor rating. You do not see this movie if you're a fan of L'Engle because you'll be very disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as it was my case) it is a good movie!
