This may sound crazy to people who remember this show ... but I remembered this as a live event I do not think I ever saw the cartoon before. But the film? Can. I remember it very clearly. The man in the Kinda building was like a showroom. He even had a red jacket. It was dark and turned into a red car and there was this guy in the second level looking at him. The car / guy turns around and crashed through a large showroom window type and out into the street. Then I started to go out. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers this as well. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope I am not.
