I hired this movie after I heard about a fuss about not being offered an Oscar, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it did not happen. Despite the beautiful photography, however, the film moves very slowly, although he barely has any plot. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a young boy trying to reconcile with the death of his parents as he may or may not have. It was an accident (the film was not clear at all), and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy tales. Imaginary stories contain the only parts of interest in the plot, but they are too short, and do not seem to be of any use. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale is especially about a boy trying to get a magic flower for his deceased girlfriend to save her life, but the boy is delayed by first tasting the flower to make sure it is not toxic and that leads to results. It is a few seconds behind the rescue of his girlfriend - the grandfather then states that the moral is that the boy was not very patient, but that makes no sense because he was too cautious and slow, which led to his failure. Perfect metaphor for this film really. <br /> <br /> However, Skye's beautiful portrayal, but then was released from Stardust this year and is another film about fairy tales filmed in Skye and beautifully filmed - which is better than this.
