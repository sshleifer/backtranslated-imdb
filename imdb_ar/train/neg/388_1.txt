I can not afford most of the reality shows, which is worse than the Paris Hilton program, and certainly it's his company. But "You are abandoned" or "You are a tenant", how many seasons now? After watching the show, I do not want to work with the guy with the ego and all I think and watch the dry paint contain more of the entertainment valve. <br /> <br /> I love to hear just one person standing up and saying "Donald I quit and took some of your money and buy a decent hairstyle." I see it even trying to buy fame in Wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I do not have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad that you want fame to be too bad and you do not have the talent to make yourself try to buy it. I will give this offer a negative sign if I can get it, but it gets 1 and it does not deserve it.
