I hope you can save me from these films that teach us that crime is fun and justifiable. Add to this a written text that is a strong desire to be the brother of Farrelli or Quinn, as well as the life of another group of supposedly high school-age children acting as a teenager full Dawson Creek with GenXYZ soundtrack is sadly trying to Make the film "great" and we have a highly qualified and intense spelling. <br /> <br /> This is not even "Ferris Bueller" ... but better seen changing the traffic signal. <br /> <br /> There is only one scene anywhere near the admission price: when Betty Masked girls meet a friend of Richard Nixon disguised. It is a surreal moment. So priceless. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, I prefer to feel pain in my teeth. At least I can apply some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
