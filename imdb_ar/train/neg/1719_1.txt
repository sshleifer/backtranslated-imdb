Crater Lake Monster is one of the most fragile amateur movies I have ever seen - Manos and Hands of Fate were rated in terms of bad representation, futile direction and production values ​​at the kindergarten level. In this film, a moving dinosaur wakes up on the mud / stop after a meteorite hits a lake in Bumblebum, California, and begins eating on local tropical animals. At an exciting climax, a creature, described by a local as the "giant crocodile with fins," is a huge drag on the ground to chase lunch, before the bulldozer collides several times and dies of boredom. Every character in this film is a complete fool. One useless subdivision shows a fly in a liquor store to buy $ 4.75 from Ripple; instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and passerby, shoots a policeman, and chases the lake, all so the monsters Who ate it. The painful proximity of the beast reveals that it is only a piece of Styrofoam. There is a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legitimate), two very backward trawlers, some prehistoric "cave art" made of crayon, and a baffling Beijing baffle background. In one painful scene, the fake magician and his wife / girlfriend / partner can manage the film for another 4 minutes by tapping on how stars can see in the night sky, although time is still clear throughout the day. Even in the case of rapid, steady progress, this limb hurts and hurts. MooCow says he called smokers, because this cow pie is really teasing! : = 8P
