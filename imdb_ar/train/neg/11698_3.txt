This step reminded me of the tales of Crypt Keeper. They have the same kind of ideas about getting people what they deserve. I think this is always what they have in the story of Crypt. The same applies to bad representation. Acting very bad. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people did not like it and did not expect much. When I watch Stephen King, I do not expect much because all his films are terrifying compared to those of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were wonderful books. I like the way Carrie played as if it were a real story and the whole book is a collection of reports and theories as well. that was good. But I noticed that the two novels were not like movies. The endings were very different then the film versions. I assume from these two narratives that all his novels have changed considerably and that the endings are always cheesy. End of thinner is the worst. Many cheeses. I want to read the book to see the real end. I suggest anyone who intends to read Stephen King's novels to watch his films before handing out the cards so that they can compare. This way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I intend to do this with all his novels that have been converted into movies. I'm sure if they were converted to movies, they were really good books ... and a very wrong script error.
