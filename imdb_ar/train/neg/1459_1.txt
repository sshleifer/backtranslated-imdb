This is by far one of the most tedious stories of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but his portrayal as Hitler's leader is just a mistake. To distinguish Liev Schrieber as a longtime friend and assistant to Hitler, Haefengstal must have unleashed cries of despair and distress from Simon Wiesenthal's center. J-W played one of the Nazi supporters, bad bad bad casting. This was not a fun family film with a good historical background. This was the Hollywood bullshit at its best, benefiting from the strength of strong (but largely under-utilized) supporting actors who seemed to have all disappeared from the representation radar in the last five years. <br /> <br /> The fake German dialects (vee vill vin zis var) are an insult to the German people everywhere. My mother is German and I sat smoking on the sounds of voices that have been transformed from America / English / German all in the same sentence. The support group works to provide cardboard cutouts at the local video store better than on the screen. Gina Malone as Jilli Robal was a wonderful destiny. She discovered the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her life to escape what her future would have been under Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a great and historically accurate account of the early years of Hitler that preceded and included the War / Holocaust, "Inside the Reich" was rented in 1983 by Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacoby. The role of Hitler. This was good and it made more sense than this nonsense. <br /> <br /> As a historian of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you, this has made me contact my books to confirm countless inaccuracies.
