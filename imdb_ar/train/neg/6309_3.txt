This film had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter in this film failed miserably and created a boring and boring tape that made me feel like I had returned to the class of social studies for Mr. Hartford's eighth grade - back to 67. <br /> <br /> Get lost, would you please take this story and make a film Real - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time there was a possible scene, all that was left for us was a few cliches, with black and white footage they might have obtained from The History Channel to show the event. The shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boring festival. The other acting was incredibly bland - it fits well with the film, and the captain played a new low standard for the line. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the many drawbacks of this movie and do not care about horror or entertainment, but you want to know about USS Mason, it's worth watching.
