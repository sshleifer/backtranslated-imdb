As this film continues, it seems to go on forever forever - the more disturbing it becomes, and quite frankly, what a waste of time I am sitting in this complete nonsense. How do people make such films on the ground, or actually get funding for such garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb because it proves that you can fool some people all the time. In this picture, the main players are obsessed with weapons, so it is not difficult to determine how the film will eventually be revealed. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it strange that society in the United States has such an outrageous and deadly culture. <br /> <br /> Anyway: <br /> <br /> The main actor depicts a loser escaping into a fantasy world of being cowboys in urban creep. He comes across a family with two naughty little boys, a teenage girl and boy; he is cared for by the strict father and father who can barely deal with him. The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice versa, and the losing boy seems to be caught by the loser's madness. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all the time in a state of realism and depression. The total loser who prefers to go to the beach and then work to live, and then commit a robbery against his family because he is so lazy that he can not make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to see either a sad loser in a fantasy world with a desire to die, or a poor family that is not actually much better than white trash? <br /> <br /> This movie does not make sense to drivel. <br /> <br /> He saves himself only from getting the least possible sign through half listening to the mighty music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
