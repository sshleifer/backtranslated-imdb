First of all, this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can not laugh with difficulty. Second, the film is slow and tedious. Acting is not bad but not special. Lucky Luke is a comic about two families (one with big noses and one big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and beliefs are not the best source of good comedy work and this film does little more than confirm this rule. There is a comedic theme similar to 'Home Teachers'; this was some good moments. My last comment is: Do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspiring and boring film.
