This is not a good film. Representation is rigorous and not significantly convincing. The film does not seem to know whether it will result from a real horror curriculum or whether it is walking through the camp and demolishing it. I have never seen the first film, but this film does not stand on its own merits. There are many unconvincing transformations and conspiracies and the viewer never realizes the importance of leading female vampires. Not worth the effort of watching
