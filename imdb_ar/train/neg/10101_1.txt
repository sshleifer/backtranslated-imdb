Notice I was given this 1 star if the option was given and I would have given this zero. When I put this DVD on my TV and sat on the couch, I was expecting some of the worst cinematic works at its best. I looked at this movie on IMDb and saw it was the worst film I rated, so I think I came to him and criticized every mistake. But she no longer had the foolishness that was about to flow from my television screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this movie look like it looks good at best. Do not let this fool you. This movie must be banned from all shelves around the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is like pornographic but without any sexual scenes in it. Representation (if you can call it), "drawing" (many holes must look like Swiss cheese), special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it would be funny to see it. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying I can make a better film, but I'm thinking about it.
