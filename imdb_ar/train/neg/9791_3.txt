This is basically about a couple who want to adopt a second child. In the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt it. If you think this is stupid, be careful, because it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated as a human child. (Save me!) The rest are the usual cliches, about family problems, the jealousy of Big Brother, and finally all the issues are solved and they are all a "happy family". Dull and worn out as it is, also appears in the most severe and undeveloped ways. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director thinks he is creative by inserting the mouse into the cliches, or just trying to fill in the minutes, but he upgraded the cliché from boring to obnoxious. <br /> <br /> So why was given the number 3 and not the zero? Because of the family cat, who loves Stewart as much as "brother". Because of some funny cars, Stuart takes advantage of his small size. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the film will work well if: Stuart was a pet and not a "brother". B. I kept the funny cars, like Stuart, who tried to beat the cat, and left the boring clichés that did not match anything else.
