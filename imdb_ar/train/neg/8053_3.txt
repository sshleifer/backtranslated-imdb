As an assumption, this back-up version of the Dead Dead story was promised. <br /> <br /> However, the failure of director Eric Reid to provide a convincing hurricane leads to a flood of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br /> In the end, the viewer is more satire than the strange weather effects of the intended story. Intermittent periods of excess direction are similar in the grip of pork. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, who is doing Chetik's "Brave Hardwood Back", is doing his best to save the film. But in the end, the Undertow is like a pig ... and has more pork to take off.
