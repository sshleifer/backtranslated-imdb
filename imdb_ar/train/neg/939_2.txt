I love the Batman TV series, and I was really looking forward to it. But they tried to do a lot. <br /> <br /> Why was the story of Adam West and Bert Ward in an attempt to restore the cathedral beyond me? I do not want to hit Burt or Adam the way they look now ... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but seeing them in formal suits and fighting the "demons" was sad. I just want to see the former stars comment. The side story of the batmobile game was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the flashback, I think it was too short and too much to be ruled out. It was really just a quick glance in my opinion. I want more background. Show penguins and joker for about a minute just to tell them the same things you already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his mug and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated her and was a former smoker. This was on these 2. <br /> <br /> I love reading the book. I'm sure it contains more than it showed. Such as why there were 2 puzzles or why it freezes 3 cat or 3 master. Where he was Commishioner Gordon, Cheef OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut and so on. The list goes on. As I said even those that were in this barely one in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really tacky.
