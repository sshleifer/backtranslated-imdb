So far, the worst film I've seen is Ben & Arthur. You should really check out reviews of this movie instead of this movie. The review statistics for this film were indirectly positive through an unrelenting push by some of the people involved in its preparation, which makes it easier to detect evidence on the Internet to some extent. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur honor enough to allow them to stand on his fragile feet, instead of promoting him unscrupulously until the injured buy me like me. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is bad, script, story, acting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... What goes into the film? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it gets. If it is not too annoying, it will be ridiculous. I kept watching him think that he should improve, because I have not yet discovered that no positive reviews can be relied on. <br /> <br /> It does not take much money to create a great movie, and the low budget does not mean the film is bad. My favorite ideal for a low budget masterpiece is the wonderful Mala Noche for Gus Van Sant, but there are many other examples. Secrets of the Sideline ?? Director cut or bad original is not because the people who made it had no money, but because they got a lot of weight and have no talent for anything but self-promotion.
