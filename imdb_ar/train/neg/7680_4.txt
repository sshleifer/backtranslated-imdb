Snow White is in my opinion a bad film from a technical point of view. This plot is highly predictable, the characters are stereotyped, and the editing is highly exaggerated. In any case, it seems that the film does not have a lot of artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct business thing. Including the character of the French part of Switzerland (the IS actor is the band leader who is touring the film - it seems that the band called SENS UNIK) aims to a larger audience. No direct German-Swiss film will be sold in the French section - and vice versa. What really happened to my nerves were the product placements throughout the film. Remember Sometines scenes from your ad clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the subject of "young people who use drugs without any other goals in their lives" is a widespread fact in Zurich. Therefore, it should be developed more carefully. I hope Samir gets enough money with Snow White, so that his next film will show his real artistic skills.
