This film is a shining example of the dissipation of great resources in the film. In the future, SNL and SCTV stars in the prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Jo Flaherty, were mainly in 70 minutes of malicious and unethical jokes and racist jokes. It was possible that the concept of a network of society sabotaging the future has been moved to some interesting radicalism, but instead directly outside the gate, makes humor inspired by the lame events, and remains in this context of humor. Groove Tube is more subversive and smarter or Kentucky Fried Movie movie later. This movie is dedicated only to those who wish to watch a time capsule of bad comedy films that depicts the 70 bad film.
