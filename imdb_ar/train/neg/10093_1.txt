I can not believe a turnout carrying this film. It was so bad. I have completely deceived the art box. Do not be fooled! Not worth your time I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews for this click are a joke or what. I am so disappointed. : <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not match The girl with the voodoo is a stripper, while the summary on her back indicates that she is only 17. The people who write the description of the film should If anyone really likes this click, you have lost all confidence in humanity. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start the story compared to the title, Or the fact that the whole movie was done in two places, or that the police did not even have uniforms, why would I even say that? Unlike the rest of the film, the uniform was topical. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the zombie type and all its fans.
