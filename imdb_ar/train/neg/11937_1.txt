Supernatural movies always suck pretty much, and that's no exception. The quality of its only replacement is the fact that the film may be worse. I would like to put "Batman & Robin" and "Steel" above this movie, so yeah it's bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black hero, check out "Blankman" not a "serious" superhero movie But at least amusing.
