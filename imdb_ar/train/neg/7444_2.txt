Unless you are angry with the Russian people or pigs, this film will be a quick event. In fact, I was sleeping for about 40 minutes and I had to fight the urge to leave the theater. I wish I had. The Saturday evening waste is absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br /> Even Silent Hill was even more terrifying. Heck, even the Pan Maze was more terrifying. I'm still unclear about what was supposed to be scary at this click. <br /> <br /> First of all, I am very concerned about films that use "simplified language in Russian" as did the film in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all complain. My God. <br /> <br /> They are. Well, fortunately for me (and maybe you too) this movie has already escaped my mind and I have gone out an hour ago. So I do not have any details, only the vague pictures are not going anywhere and the hope is now weak that anything will happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely distorted version of this film because I can not believe it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) and ended up being completely free of not only horror or suspense but from Total entertainment value also. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 because, yes, I grew up and wanted to leave 40 minutes later but I woke up and did not leave.
