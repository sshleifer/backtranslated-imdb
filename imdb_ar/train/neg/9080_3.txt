Well, I ordered this to pay per view at home because I felt bored and I needed to laugh. I must admit, I've had a chuckle a few times, but I do not remember the parts they were in. I do not understand why this film was made. She claims to be a comedy but seriously, I do not find a musical bar or a 70-year-old naked woman very funny. This film has been trying to integrate itself into "comprehensive" comedy films in recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it failed miserably. It was way too much progressive then it was a comedy. Also, why on Cameron Diaz attach her name to this film?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were at the pool. I thought it was exciting, fun and well done. Besides, avoid this movie. 10/03
