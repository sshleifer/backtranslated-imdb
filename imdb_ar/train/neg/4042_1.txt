This movie is nice to look at, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there is one) is meaningless. But he is a "technician" too. Many of the actors are dressed in half-wrestling clothes and are looking deeply into each other's eyes. Lots of screenshots of windows and with people outside the window. He mumbled and the people roamed with sadness. Close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you reach the trio on the roof with the cat, you will be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be about the father-son relationship, but you'd be hoping that only two of them would get $ & $ with each other and get it. If you always want to watch bad Russian gay movies without any financial footage, you have been granted your desire.
