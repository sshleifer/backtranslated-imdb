Really, really bad. How to make a bad film? I kept waiting for some plot points, interesting camera work, or at least some unwarranted nudity, but I did not get anything. I had just seen Cabin Fever and thought it was a train wreck (except for nudity and pancakes) but it seemed to be a genius compared to this wreck. The best film doctor in the world could not have saved this bustling pile of stinking stools. <br /> <br /> The only thing that happens to this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid only $ 5 for it and will soon end up in the landfill.
