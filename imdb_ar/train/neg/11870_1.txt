This is the most frustrating film I have ever seen. I saw it at first as a child and even thinking about it now really bothers me. I know it was set at a time when life was difficult and I know that these people were poor and the crops were vital. Yes, I get it all. What I find difficult to capture is that I do not remember a single light moment in the entire film. Maybe it was true in life, I do not know. I'm quite sure that the acting was top notch and that the direction and quality of the photography etc. was fantastic, and I know that every film can not have a happy ending but as a family movie, it's bad for me. <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a movie. I can not stress enough how this film affected me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories went back. I think he will have all but heartless access to Prozac.
