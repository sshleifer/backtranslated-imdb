I heard about this film and knew it was not good. But I started watching the film (on my channel) and was interested. This can be a great black satire that obscures the ethics of the day in the media. The small features in each contest were good. It's based on something I do not want to miss. But when the labeled show begins, everything becomes unreasonable, cheap and somewhat ridiculous. This is where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead, I concluded this article and assumed that people are stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad, I give it 1. Even if the movie promises.
