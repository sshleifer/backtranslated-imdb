I went to see this at Esquire Theater in Sensi, Ohio - and I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves was a more believable angel. <br /> <br /> It was a painful film, but seeing Bret Carr personally was a vision of despair at its height. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of my film was watching the BC movie before it appeared and the "C" battery. The jury is still in this regard. It was a dildo and it was in slow mo. Yeah. <br /> <br /> "Shoot the left side of the face only ... People are famous for asking for things!" - Brett Carr B. Carr wore a chicken suit for a little reverse psychology, roving the streets of Clifton and bumping into his own film. he has to. This is true to shrink the film. <br /> <br /> I felt terrified after this film. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not attractive enough to be a leader of worship, or clever enough for this matter. This is the feeling you feel from the experience of "Maemil Pepsi" from the impressive new reptiles that came to see this piece of Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this movie, very good-bye. <br /> <br /> - Anonymous
