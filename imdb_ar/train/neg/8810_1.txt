This film is one of the films I regretted investing for 90 minutes in my life and I will never go back to it. The hypothesis is really interesting - it's basically a coma from the perspective of the undead (let's not divide the hair whether she's already died or not), and unfortunately she has failed to present a convincing story in this context. To the reality of the film, but it absorbs all the entertainment value directly if they do more to keep the viewer engaged, they would likely lead social commentary to the house.
