I can not believe how horrible this film is. I feel so charmed that I refer to it as a "film". The representation was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot left many key questions unanswered. The premise was fine, if not original: a small group of foreigners living in the United States and trying to control humanity slowly. But he quickly goes down from there. How can they persuade a "human being" to accept a foreigner as his wife in order to make them a hybrid person they need? They show alien larvae but do not show what they do. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce an ideal-looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the huge alien beast with teeth. The end was very painful to watch. I suppose I'm very disappointed that Bruce Bockseltner will have anything to do with this. How can he say to the huge beast with teeth, "Stay away from you son of Bash" with a straight face? It is a long fall from Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
