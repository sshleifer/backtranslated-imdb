I will not waste too much time at this time because, as far as I'm concerned, it is not really a movie to start with, just a blaze of barbaric shots and embarrassing new amateur shots made just for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and calling it "Boogeyman" . Literally, 80% of this film was stolen from his superior predecessor, "The Boogeyman," a film that the book of this garbage did not seem to bother him to watch because they could not even get the original character of actress Susanna Loew (Lacy) right. To insult the injuries, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, and they seem to think that their audience is as stupid as them. 0 out of 10 I hope that the IMDb rating system is very low, and it is the most brutal and rude attempt to break the money people have seen, you have been warned!
