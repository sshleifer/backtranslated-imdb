What happens to RGV? He seems to be repeating himself in every film. Are creative ideas running out? If it has, the time to take the back seat. I went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course I did not imagine it would be anywhere near the original. She learned she would not do, boredom said everything. But until then I thought it would be a great treatment for RGV, after all, is not he the same man who took out Sathya and Company? Or is it? I have my doubts after watching AAG. I will not talk about the plot or the story, since most of it is taken from the original, if you really die to go to see this, you can play a fun game with friends: select scenes from the original one and give your own ratings! So I became Veeru Huirou (how did you feel this?), I think Heeru will not look great. Ajay Devgan's disaster is just as Huero, the tense comedy and the slow talk that was effective in the company seems fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, Nisha is trying to be more charming. This reaches the peak in the end. Raj actually is not bad compared to others, he is a man to watch in the future. I was really disappointed by Amitabh Bachchan in Baban's role, it's like a cartoon of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl covered entirely in a shawl, instead of the inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his power. The only performance that really emerged was Mohan Lal as a Narasimha inspector. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
