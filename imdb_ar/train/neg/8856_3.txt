Lee hosted a hundred years of horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about wolves in the film. He said something that the only brush that contained the lactan was The Howling II, and he joked, "The less talk about it the better." In fact it was right because this film might be the worst in its full length of screen displays. Howling by Joe Dante was the first leading feature film with its stunning special effects and overall sense of elegance and theme. It was a film that should be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers thought for some strange reason that more alternative implications were needed than what worked the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles away and miles from the first on each front. There is nothing scary at all. Looks cheap and black in most major color scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning (well, I'll give up on Verdi Maine too). It seems embarrassing to me as he says in a terrible dialogue and does silly things (see that ends with him and will be). It seems incredibly tired to me and I know what is going on, a richer boy than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not worth studying here, and you can bet on having a very small story to point out when you have to play Stephen Parsons and his band Babel in much of the film at the beginning and end with this scary noise. Sibel Daning is here, and yes, it degrades again and again, then we show this scene over and over again - one of the reviewers said 17 times (I counted ten - but maybe I was bored by my mind at that stage) the movie was given three stars, Who I gave is 1 for me and two for Mrs. Daning's contributions. YUK!
