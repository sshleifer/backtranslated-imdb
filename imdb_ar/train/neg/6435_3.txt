I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this film in the same context as an exorcist. When the Exorcist was precise and creepy, Stigmata was frank, subtle and very kind. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a while, but the images do not show up to the downward spiral of the show that takes care of them making them unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was peaked when compared to the evil spirit repellent, and my visit to the official site increased my interest. The Web site contains many stories about "actual" stigmas throughout history. However, scene after scene, the film is too obsessed with the pursuit of "authenticity" to become a comedy at first, and then difficult to see in the end. I began to feel suspicious when the priest in charge of investigating the possible miracles enters the beauty salon where our heroine is cutting her hair, and she is clearly revolting with the priests. He begins to receive the wounds of Christ (stigma) and is puzzled and distressed by this ordeal. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Does Satan have Frankie or a ship to Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this film is that it ends in the end.
