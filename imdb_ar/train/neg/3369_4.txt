Well, my God, am I disappointed. When I first heard of a new version of Robert Wise's 1963 film "The Haunting," I had a fear that many of the visual effects would ruin it with the size of the summer film. But, deep down, I had faith. Certainly, with such a talented cast sound ... De Bont and the company will not spoil a film, whose original film was wonderful and frightening and understood the art of subtle tenderness. Well, accurately, where are you now !! ?? I realized my fears ... a wrong film promising. Yes, Eugenio Zanetti's production design is declining. The film was filmed beautifully. The composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do wrong. But the script puts good actors to the test ... and urges them to provide a kind of diluted dialogue that is only spoken in films. In the end, the brilliant Lilly Taylor is always the only performer to escape with some dignity ... this is hardly. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, we feel that terrible dread of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we're supposed to be afraid of ... and you know what? I also realized as wonderful as it is ... visual effects bear fruit absurd. A climax is a fantazogoric mess ... but things have gone a long way wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is overpriced. I fear that there are no real hiccups or shouts in this haunted old haze ... just groans. Check the original instead. <br /> <br />
