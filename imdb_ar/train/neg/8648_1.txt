Well, basically, the movie blows! It is a charming game Blair meets the imagination of Sean Bin sin about going to Iraq to show the world the meaning of "war on terror." The script looks like it was written by the eighth grade (there is no insult to eighth graders); the two main actors outperform the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong kind of movies (not that I know anything about those things - but they do not seem to Like the real documentaries I've seen), and worst of all, Christian Johnson took a wonderful idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time when I tried to paint a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with something very bad that looked like a giant feces. Best watch the 8th Blair witch, instead of watching it again.
