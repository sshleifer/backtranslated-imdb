"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, not in a good way. It was worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: Caves are an alternative race, they face prejudice, and so on. Probably the dumbest idea created; it is almost worth the jail sentence for the book. One of them showed the cave men entering the club and trying to pick up the girls, and nothing else happened. She reminded us of hearing Andy Rooney's conversation for 22 minutes, followed by Death Knives through the cannibals of a dwarf. For those who have not seen this presentation, here's an example of the dialog box: "You're sure you're OK to go out with the cave man." "Yes, that's good, I loved 10,000!" Hilarious ... probably the best book I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cave men with terrible makeup, dealing with difficult social issues ... Sounds like an amusing night. I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they resorted to making a sitcom of auto insurance ads. I wonder if they will do Gecko after that, so I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would say that this is worse than Viva Laughlin. At least "Viva Laughlin" was extracted from something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> Similar performances make me hope there will be a guilty person somewhere targeting the Earth. <br /> <br /> (Unbelievable ...)
