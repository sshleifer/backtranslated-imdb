I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were in a submarine patrol in the North Atlantic and this film was scheduled in the evening. We all surrendered after the second pulley. They did not try to show it at midnight. Choose to restart instead ...... This is all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I'm not supposed to comment in random terms, so I'll keep walking until I get my 10 lines from BS. I did not find George Goebel included in the credits but I remember him in the film. Sin was awful and the songs worse.
