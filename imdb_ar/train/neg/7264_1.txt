Just another film exploits the unwarranted frontal nudity; horrifying representation. In addition, their love scenes are the most memorable events I have ever seen (which does not mean I do not associate the idea of ​​two people making love because I am gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil Nubes de Paz, Julian Hernandez directed an amazingly amazing film with a story that evokes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes, but managed to produce a two-hour film ... This time, there is not even the issue of racism and commodities in the LGBT community to talk about! Oh Allah, have mercy on us!
