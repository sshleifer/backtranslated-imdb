Earth's views, which Nasa claims to have been recently falsified with historical weather data at Apollo 11, have been compared, showing a good match between cloud patterns in the video sequence and actual rainfall records on the day. <br /> <br /> This seems to undermine the whole argument in the film that the "whole earth" image is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft's window. <br /> <br /> I am now waiting for Bart Sibrel to claim that historical weather data has been falsified by NASA, although this will undoubtedly entice them to replace every copy of a newspaper with a weather map, and those in private hands not Still represents a problem. <br /> <br /> Ah, answer: "Trying to discredit this film by pointing to NASA weather data, which I say is a charming but weak and naive argument." What about the rest of the footage and evidence in the film? A wise man once said something About the screening of mosquitoes and the ingestion of camels, do you feel in any way that this may apply to what you are trying to do here ?:-) This film is full of irrefutable evidence against the earlier US government claim that Moon missions were successful, Now you are the real masters of the universe, it's almost as if it's just you watching the movie J is a bit different from the previous one. "<br /> <br /> First, weather data does not come from NASA. Second, weather data undermine a major claim in the film. Third, far from being "full of irrefutable evidence," the remaining allegations in the film have been fully exposed. Was a previously secret film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation, but unfortunately, the source of his film is a public domain, and the bits edited by Sebril contradict his claims.
