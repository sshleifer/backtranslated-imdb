I rented this on a DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a kind of movie "studying characters", so I struggled to watch almost an hour before pressing the stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with studying theme characters, I just can not get into this movie at all. Maybe my mood was to want to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but with that aside, I tried my best to move forward to finish watching, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the world group did not meet to keep my interest. About the only interesting thing is stealing a sergeant gun and hurried to buy another one and painted it in black to appear as a police case. I think this film should have been entitled "Who stole the Sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well done but once again I felt that I had been robbed of anything coherent to keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Since I have not finished watching it, I say there are some advantages to renting this movie. .. Can. For me, it was a waste of good display voltage and time. I will leave it to you to try it, but it is not what I strongly recommend.
