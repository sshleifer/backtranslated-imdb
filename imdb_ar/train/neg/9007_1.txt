This movie is some of the worst crap I have ever seen. I felt a sharp pain in my head as I watched this movie. The CGI was awesome, and the story was just a waste of ink. The personal character of Ken Dean was super intuitive, I can not tell anything, but he does not seem to be working with his helicopter properly. The biggest problem was split screen camera action. I felt like I was watching a Brady Bunch or anything, just were not different people in the boxes, just were close and different views of the same thing. I can only emphasize that the actors really needed the money, because this film was not worth the film that was filmed on it.
