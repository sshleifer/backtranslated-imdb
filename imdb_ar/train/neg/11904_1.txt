The "End of Violence" and certainly the Million Dollar Hotel hinted that Winders had lost his vision and ability to tell compelling stories through a map of moving pictures.

For the first time in a long time, I was impatient until the film ended so that I could continue my life. The war-torn, national-theoretical delirium of the nation staring at the sky in the end ... I was struck by everything as very simple and pathetic, and it was hardly a film director who did some magic on the screen. what happened? The days of experimentation, cognitive writing and exciting photographic possibilities have been a long time behind, I fear. Let's hope to find his inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I watched the film, Winders was there to present it. He was completely lacking in modesty and gave us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid it can not be more wrong ...
