Unfortunately, there was no 0 rating or otherwise I chose it. This film lacks the stellar power of the original film. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Currie, Bernadette Peters, Edward Herman, the patent of newcomer Elaine Quinn, and an expert from veteran director John Huston (the father of actress Angelica Houston) made this film fascinating. Until a new edition in 1999 with Cathay Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Caming, and Christine Chenweth had more to offer than this unfortunate excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, Ashley Johnson became famous as Krisy Severs in Growing Pains. She had a few parts in the movies but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to carry a movie on her own. The addition of Joan Collins as Edwina Hogbottom is ridiculous! They could not get enough good actors to play key roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie but they would sign Joan Collins to play with a British lady? It does not surprise me that this film was as bad as it was. Critics have been right not to agree with this film, even if it was only prepared for television, it has been a bad supplement to a beloved film.
