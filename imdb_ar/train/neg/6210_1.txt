This is the worst film I've seen since "I Know Who Killed Me" with Lindsay Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that it is nothing but frustration and disappointment waiting to be chosen. Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of you ... Did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, what f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving anything, here's the story in a nutshell ... Nine wake up, do things, his actions and decisions irrelevant. The movie ends. Oh wait ... Here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Alert the spoiler! The spoiler is on alert! At the end of the film .... raining. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
