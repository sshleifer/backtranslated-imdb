I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's film with great expectation after the endless fuss and the 6 Oscars that were awarded. Unfortunately, it really is not a good film. The portrayal of the situation was certainly accurate and reliable in all respects, but then the story simply appeared incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and random. The actors made good efforts, but for me I did not really get what the film was trying to be. It's not in the atmosphere and it's like a full metal jacket, not an epic like Band of Brothers, not a full movement ... well, anything. Certainly I can not see why he was nominated for so many, nor why "design" him with these epic proportions. Keep in mind that given the level of movies in the past two years, I think there is not much to choose from.
