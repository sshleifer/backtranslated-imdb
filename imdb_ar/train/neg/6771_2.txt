There are a few good things to talk about, but I can tell you that Matt Dillon is doing his best to make something out of nothing, and many screens and graphics are worth dividing. Since most race films suffer from the assumption that car lovers are not smart, we end up with films like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised many in Mean Girls, should make better decisions about what roles to take. Here can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will be entertained moderately just because they are trying to attract more adults than children (although still stupid). There was no real interest in the theater I saw in a few minutes. As a family sports film, this is terrible. The best moments at first in the Skirbard created some feelings and then the festival at the Bash Car created some tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you should develop it better here. After some forced race scenes you are in the best part: being able to leave a double in your car.
