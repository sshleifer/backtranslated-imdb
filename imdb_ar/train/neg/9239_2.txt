Heavenly Days Commits Serious Comedy: It's a desperate attempt to teach us a lesson in civic education, and it will not stop until we pass the final exam. Weber McGee and Molly are on a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate working (or failing to work, if you prefer) and spitting with a senator (Eugene Pallet in one of his worst career roles) Typical stereotypical, familiarity with a man in a train reads a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, it was considered a communist trick, but in 1944, it was A-OK. Add some really horrifying musical moments, a lot of scam tricks, and a boring sub-plot about newspaper correspondents, and you have a movie that should be ready for Philip Willy to prepare a pen Generation of Vipers 2: D.C Boogaloo. Not terribly true, heavenly days are another reminder that Satan has all the best tunes.
