This is a high-grade cheesecake of kung fu film b. Bruce "Wannabe" Bruce Lee played ... I think. Of course, let's show quick shots of Bruce and make close-ups of his eyes. If you fail in the right corner during a certain time of day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You'll laugh at how the link between the movies is not very good, but some of the great deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown in the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was shot dead while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think that Bruce can excuse me for trying to be Bruce although his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (who still for some reason simulates Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very weak) See Bruce goes one-on-one with the cowardly lion . Department of props stopped by Kai-b, as you see. Bruce also has no embarrassment in beating a man with paralysis. In the end, the director decided, "Let's go back to the flashback" for a scene just 3 minutes ago !! They should have thought that single-cell organisms with ADHD can understand this film perfectly. <br /> <br />
