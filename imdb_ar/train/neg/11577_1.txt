The filmmaker tries to be Quentin Tarantino, and the screenwriter tries to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Anger tries to be Faye Donaway, and the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Willis, and Michael Rucker tries to be Jane Hackman, and Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye. Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the window as quickly as possible (successfully), do not ask for Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spyder try to hide them from these crazy things. It provides an endless dialogue with little meaning and little work. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevator lobbies, Art Deco Church of Bruce Goff and a beautiful palace by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, do not see this movie. They do not do justice to the location.
