I am a big fan of the television series Largo Winch. This movie was a pain for me. I had to use fast forward not to fall asleep. It was boring! How can a person destroy this title so much? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live the role. The main actor (tom ...) is wrong. See other roles for this actor. The fighting scenes were incredibly boring and could not be followed up, somehow they did not follow the situation. Like other reviewers said a low budget movie with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else could do something better than this address. The French can do the right thing with big movies, like Alien 4. That was a bit more, after Alien 1,2,3.
