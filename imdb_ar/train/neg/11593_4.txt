I consider this movie one of the worst in the nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember anything 20 minutes after the film ended, so I was tired of writing a review. <br /> <br /> Well, # 4 was a joke and Freddie is a clown. # 5 Try going back to the roots of the chain. It was darker and more airy than Nightmare 4, which is basically good. They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and fears. Because of this nightmare 5: A child's dream is neither funny nor scary. What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors (except maybe Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddie's friends killed Lisa using the unborn baby dreams in Lisa) is a good rule but it is not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (perhaps because none exist) and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers were up to. The script must have more holes than the Swiss cheese, so the film was very cheesy (let me say I do not like cheese, even if you are from Switzerland). The special effects were not as good as in Part 4. For example. <br /> <br /> Do not cost yourself the trouble of renting / buying this movie if not for completion, it's in chaos. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also messy ...)
