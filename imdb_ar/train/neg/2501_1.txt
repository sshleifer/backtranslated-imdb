I saw this on TV the other night? Or rather I went to another channel often to see commercials when I could not stand to see them anymore. was bad. Really, really bad. Not "very bad, it's good." How was it funded? Who thinks this was a good idea? A friend tested my representative and told me that he was not good enough to play the role of a bad man, but I think what they meant was "Save yourself and escape this steam pile that has reached @ $ $%." I bet that the rest of the representatives have been given the option. To be fair, it was difficult to judge representation because of the horrible American ascension. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The work was awkward and stacked. The dialogue was invalid. By far the worst thing was the ship. In real life, the phrase Interislander is a shabby boat and does not appear in the film well. Instead of a very failed attempt to make it look like a new crew with a bunch of clowns wrapped around the noisy ballot boxes, I do not want you to, they might be able to change the script to explain or even celebrate the uncertainty. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Do not watch this movie, not even a joke.
