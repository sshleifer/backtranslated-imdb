This movie is a stupid attempt at a kind of erotic excitement. A tourist bus on its way to Las Vegas was attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving sand dunes. They take them out into the desert and steal all their precious possessions. The plot is constantly changing. In one minute, they are looking to kidnap a rich farmer's daughter, and the next day they are looking for a $ 90,000 collection stamp. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
