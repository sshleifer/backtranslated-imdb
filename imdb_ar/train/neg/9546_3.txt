If you think the origin of the 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse you ask? Well ... at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy running in a sports vest. Unlike modern graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a new voice for Ripley, unfortunately this is the same sad story. Anyone who saw the first one can see exactly where the scene / line was next in the story. And for those who have not seen the first one ... consider yourself lucky that you only saw it once. Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.
