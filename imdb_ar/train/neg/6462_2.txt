This unfortunate film shows that even some of Hollywood's best films can not save real landfill deposits. <br /> <br /> I can spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad about this effort, but this will take more time and I've already wasted 91 minutes watching ... IT. <br /> <br /> Looking at him now, after Brando's death, the extent of the tragedy of one of our greatest actors is revealed. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in more fonts to get this acceptable. I have to fill more lines to get this acceptable. I have to fill in more lines to get this acceptable. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. Good-bye.
