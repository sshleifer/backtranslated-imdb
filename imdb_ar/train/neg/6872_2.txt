This fair has good stories, but the dialogue is bad. The main character was particularly disturbing. It is quite clear why this offer was canceled, although like most UPN offers, I did not know it existed until it was restarted. <br /> <br /> Most of his plans seem to have been copied from other programs and movies, which led me to believe that the producers had no original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I did not comment enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. Your influence was not bad at the 2001 show. <br /> <br /> GNOME was a nice character.
