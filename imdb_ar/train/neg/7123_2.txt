Welcome to the bad ghost story and someone nightmare. This tale of horror finds a newly married couple (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by the memory of his ex-wife and screaming skullcaps found throughout their empty palace and tulip pond. Is the husband really trying to lead his crazy bride already? Or is the challenge gardener Mickey (Alex Nicole) who took care of the grounds of the palace since the death of the original house mistress? This low-budget horror spell contains a story that keeps your participation in the end. The special effects are so bad even in the 1958 standards. I sometimes swear that Screaming Skull looks just like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast is Reverend Snow Personal Actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the stalker (Nicole) is the director of the film. You can capture this as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
