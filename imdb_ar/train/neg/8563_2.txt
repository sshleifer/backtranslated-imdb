It is like what the title of this topic says. The only impression I got from this film is that the character of Marley Matlin was always angry, cynical and pathetic. Her first date was with the character of William Hurt, where they were dancing the dumbest. All in all, I've tried to finish watching the movie four times, and every four times I was asleep. I was watching this movie with one intention ... overcoming my problem with insomnia, because all I do is sleep. Sweet dream.
