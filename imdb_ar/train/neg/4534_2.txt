The book on which this film is based has changed my life seriously. But saying this film was disappointing is an understatement. Representation, directing, cinematography, and the whole story are terrible. I will never recommend this movie to anyone. I've told countless people about the book, but I'll tell them all now that they should not watch the movie! I did not expect to follow the book's exact plot, but they excluded many of the key components of the book. He tried the film, but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and failed the main theme of the prophecy. While I was in the position where the book was not read, I saw Celestine's prophecy as a bunch of hard bacteria. I feel very disappointed by Redfield for the way that this film appeared.
