Wow, it could have been a good film, starting with Brittany Daniels, I'm thinking we're going to get back, but nothing, the film starts again by filming children. Maybe this film would have been better if it had not been for acting. I mean, representation was terrible in most of it .. Although the poor actors had to deal with the lines, they did their best ... It still really destroys the film for me .. The twins were the only ones who seemed to have some acting skills .. The film goes on forever for the supposed horrendous conclusion .. Overall, I have seen poor budget films worse, but considering that this was a noise with 8 films to die for because I was very disappointed. Some reviewers said there was a gurly and stuff. Have you seen the same movie .. Well, that's 4 out of eight, and yet there was only one good movie ..
