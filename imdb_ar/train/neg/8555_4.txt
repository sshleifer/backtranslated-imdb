It is a very old and cheap film - a typical low-cost B-Western film in several ways. Gary Cooper was not a star yet, and this film reminds us vividly of John Wayne's early films produced for "extreme poverty" studios. With both actors, their familiar style and personality are still unsettled. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not seem like Cooper just a few years later (he talks faster in this early film, among other things). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the normal B movie era, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you want to see a woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Laila Damita is a woman of interest, and this is a very cool choice. She has a heavy accent (she was French) and was not even close to being a "beautiful movie star". By the way, she was also married to director Michael Kurtz. <br /> <br /> To me, however, the strangest and most unusual aspect of the film is the sub-plot of homosexuals - it resembles the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN of the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). Gary Cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can during a large part of the film to keep Cooper female. This hatred alone does not necessarily mean much, but there is a lot of clues throughout the film that filmmakers were actually trying to portray them as gay couples. In particular, in the end, when someone is killed, they shoot the other with arrows and die long enough to crawl to the body of his fallen friend and then fall - and his arms are stretched out around him! These things have been very agitated for this time and I think this makes this boring film really wonderful today! As far as Cooper goes and the plot, the film is a little disappointed and very capable of skipping. Unless you are curious about Damita or homosexuality, do yourself well and look for a better Western.
