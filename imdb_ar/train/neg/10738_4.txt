This blind purchase was used DVD. It led to the death of a beautiful sensation I was practicing when I ran into play. <br /> <br /> It's a bubble-headed comedy, but it's a mother. Dirty. The plot is Zany! , But the characters do things to each other and are very small, turbulent and volatile appropriately, and in the end I found it sad to see them. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box will lead me to expect something more than varying, the film Coffey is obese. (I know, I know, that quotations in the box and the nomination of the Oscars mean nothing.)
