Along with the fact that there are people who are free, and there are religious figures there. <br /> <br /> Characters are often meaningless. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, middle or ending, and nothing has been explained at all. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young man, named after the exiled Hazel Mutis, who appears to have returned from an army assignment. <br /> <br /> He arrived at a two-story house in a very poor condition, where the windows jumped. Go home and walk around and finally write a note leaving her there. This scene does not come with anything, and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It has never been explained exactly who his house is, or where people went, but we got the impression of a gunman who might have lived there at the same time. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to town. Why - do not know. Once arriving in this city, write down a name and address he sees on the bathroom wall and go to visit this woman, who is an amazing prostitute. He has been seeing her for some time, and he seems to no longer see her. Like everything else in this film, it is not about anything and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to befriend him, but Hazel is not really interested, although she continues to cross paths. Enoch is on the verge of madness. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk to them with an insult. <br /> <br /> We never know why Enoch behaves as it does, or why it behaves as honey. As he does, in addition to the fact that Hazel had an overdose of the old fundamentalist religion of fear across his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch is then fascinated by a man wearing a gorilla suit, who can get the gorilla instead of running and running. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who has been fairly narrowly injured and appears to be in a state of constant border rage, does little preaching on the streets. I have the impression that he was trying to free himself from the lie of religion that was dug into him. <br /> <br /> He had several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions do not make anything point specific, and there is no plot line. <br /> <br /> In the end, Asali surrenders to complete religious zeal and begins hurting himself. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange film. Pay attention to his strangeness, but otherwise he has nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The actors do a great job, but this film fails completely to present either a point of view or a story. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains characters around the word N from time to time without any connection to the rest of the dialog box. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
