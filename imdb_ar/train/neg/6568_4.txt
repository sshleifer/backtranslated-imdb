It is strange that Meet The People stars were movie stars who entered the new media center and became more successful, who entered the end of the production of things and enjoyed a great place on the small screen. Lucille Ball was not a big star, so he would come with the TV. As for Dick Powell, he wanted to stay away from films such as Meet The People, and his career would come out in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the film was that a young MGM player was represented in a special number and saw it at the time. His own time with June Allison was much better than what we see on screen. Powell seems to be bored arbitrarily and can not summon any kind of emotion at all. <br /> <br /> He may have been fed up with these silly plays, which he ran from Warner Brothers. The original show, Meet The People, was not a book show; it was a show and was screened in the 1940-1941 season in Broadway for 160 performances. When purchased by MGM, they canceled everything except the title and title song. The rest of the points were corrected together from various songwriters, you can not remember any of the songs. Strangely when you think of some source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen, and Rodgers & Hart. These persons must have emptied the material box. <br /> <br /> The plot is smarter than most pieces of musical advertising at the time. Powell is a writer in a magazine called Meet The People, a shipbuilding worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, interested, both interested in revision, but the creative differences keep them separate from each other to the end. This is a short film. <br /> <br /> MGM for Powell and Ball has given some good music that is the main reason for watching Meet The People. The two big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here, and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr wearing a commodity suit like Le Costello in The In Navy's dream sequence. The song Heave Ho was written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote to Lahr, The Courage Number of The Wizard Of Oz. As with everyone in the world who watched this movie, you have an idea of ​​Heave Ho looks like. <br /> <br /> Powell's next film was "Murder My Sweet", in which he finally showed goodbye, not fond of musicals. Lucy will have to wait for television before the world can see what it can really do.
