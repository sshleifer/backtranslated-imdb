Katharine Bigelow and Mark Bawal are already a complement to a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is a highly qualified surgeon who travels freely around Kabul and works on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he snatched a sniper rifle and shot Osama bin Laden from a distance of about 3,000 yards. He is eventually promoted to a sergeant, but is unable to choose between sniper and surgeon, so he resigns completely from the army. One year later, frustrated by civic life, he joined the Navy and proudly shows him the last scene wearing a white uniform.
