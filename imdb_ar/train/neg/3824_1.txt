I feel that the film has not been portrayed Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to tell Smith's life in a "comfortable" way for the leaders of the LDS Church, and historical accuracy seemed to be of little concern. The film is designed to be an "enhanced faith" experience, not a balanced view of "as a man". I took it upon myself to study Smith's life and read the works of LDS and any LDS work. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and worked well. However, this was not a realistic picture of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A long period of time has been given to reactivate an incident in which Smith fell when he was seven years old. Although this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental outlook, the main reason for his inclusion in the film was to help form a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is to portray Smith's teenage years, and the film is silent about the Smith family's participation in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that while the movie Joseph Smith appears in the wrestling competitions well, he fails to show how he sometimes got his nerves and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could have continued. This film has historically been by no means a fantasy film about a man. I would not recommend watching this movie for any other purpose than entertainment.
