Well, I paid a dollar for a DVD for this movie, and it was not worth it. It looks like it's a bad edition and it's in the public domain, and I guess. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite her fame, awards and reputation - is a family British gal who can not sing, dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the most prominent actors of the old Hollywood characters shown here should think they were doing a classic work. Director Herbert Wilcox (Nigel's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. It was very popular in Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are more absurd than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs have been included and none of them has been shown well. Skip this one and find one that stars Doris Day. At least you get some real comedy and professional style dance!
