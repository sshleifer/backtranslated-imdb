This is the best way to describe this film, which focuses on a newly married couple moving to a house chased by the wife of the first husband who died in mysterious circumstances. This sounds good and good, but what he plays is an hour of total boredom. In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that anyone prepares to die from the free coffin. Well, trust me, no one has ever taken them on this show unless there is a terrified person of plastic skulls and a peacock and exotic gardening and doors touched. The music is the worst. It is composed of a steady Tuba music that seems to be played by a sixth grader. You will discover the terrible secret so obvious that you should really wonder what people are thinking in this film. A person dies while jogging and beating their heads and the police are not called to investigate. Yes, in the end this is a slow pace (which is really bad given that the film is only one hour), a boring little tale, easy for the average person to discover. It seems that none of the characters in this flick was the average person.
