I love a good and pleasant love story (and I'm young) but when I hired a Love Story, I prayed for the end so I came as fast and painfully as possible and completely opposite to Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw while Jenny was teasing and irritating from heck in the first 15 minutes. When we learned that her condition was diagnosed with life-threatening illness, I can not help but wonder whether her death would be a terrible loss to poor Oliver or whether anyone watching this film cared. If she did not die, her disturbing personality might have pushed Oliver to the edge and eventually landed in a divorce court. <br /> <br /> People like this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 1970s.
