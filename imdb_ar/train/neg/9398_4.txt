... at least during the first half. If she had started with the three friends in the Navy and focused on the scenes of the maritime movement, it would have been a better and more interesting film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for the thriller series and close-up shots of early 20th-century ships, but it's like reaching your teeth there. Also, you do not see this movie just because Jenger Rogers is there. It has an important role, but a small role. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a show of three New York City guys working in the tourism business and also in good competition by Sally (Ginger Rogers), the candy-selling vendor along the way. World War I broke out, it seems that the three buddies are completely indifferent to the fight, but they joined the Navy anyway. One of the three with less industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) concludes the commanding officer to two others (Robert Armstrong and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more complicated, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but had no chance to tell him before the three sail to the war. <br /> <br /> The film is a little more interesting on board the ship, mainly because of our close shots of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry between the three buddies is reasonable. However, James Gleason, 49, is too old to be a swab, especially when the recruiting office sign suggests you must be between 17 and 35 years old to qualify. <br /> <br /> One real flaw is in the film that made me think everything outside the marine scenes slapped with minimal care is fashion design, or, I should say, its lack. In the scenes in New York before the First World War, everyone dressed in fashion in 1931 and everyone driving cars in 1931 - did not make any effort to return this film to a period. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you see a few scenes with Rogers' Jenner and the last 45 minutes involving a naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.
