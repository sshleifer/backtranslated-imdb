For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I will start with the bad point. <br /> <br /> Bad Points: Selection Choices (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), badly chosen cast, narration, and idea of ​​modern movie mode, direction, editing, soundtrack, and, above all, The whole idea of ​​producing a feature film from a television series was not wonderful to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ That's it! <br /> <br /> One can compare here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson cuts Daisy Duke's way into Michael Weston as Enos, and asks "Inos, Where's Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" Maybe he asked, "Enos, is this a good movie?" , The red bikini was submerged in his wisdom to say yes, although in his right mind he said, "No, not really." As I looked at the bikini, she could have been stark naked, and even this would not save this horrible piece of filmmaking. Stay away from Hazard!
