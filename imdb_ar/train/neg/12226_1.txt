I know, "I know that plan 9 of outer space" is the worst film, or perhaps "Manus, hands of fate." But I can not deal with monkey stockings. Of course * they are bad. How can it be any good? But if you are talking about films with respectable production values ​​and a talent for the bank, T. rex for all turkeys should be "Yentl". All the subtle contrast, and all their self-contained ambiguity, which pollutes everything that Barbara Streisand has done since 1964, culminates in this film. From "The Summit of the Only Nobles", "Yentl" looks to the "Born Star" and sends "The Mirror Has Two Faces". There is nothing else like that completely. What attracted emotional sympathy dragged Strisand out of this film for the best of unpredictability, and you can not imagine the audience she was playing with, even though I bet that there are nine out of ten chances because you are not a member of it. <br /> <br /> Nobel Prize laureate and Nobel Prize laureate Isaac Bachevis Singer was very angry at what Streisand did with his story so much that he publicly criticized it for it. It is a tribute to the incontrovertible Streisand prank because it has not only committed suicide, but has continued to produce more horrific films.
