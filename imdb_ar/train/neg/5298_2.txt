I hired this movie because I was browsing the horror movies section for those movies that were unheard of and could be a possible gem. I saw this, and as a fan of violence and injustice, I understood. I got an EM rating which means: very mature. I think this rare and high classification was entirely devoted to violence and everything else. The fund's warning said: severe violence, severe language and nudity. "Extreme violence" hit my imagination. The film ended up being a beautiful tame flick. She had a scene or two of the wonderful sights but I saw the worst in PG-13. Of course the amount of weight in the film is not important, is it? You have a conspiracy too. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing really special about it. Do not hire them. I am telling the truth. I can not imagine how someone can really enjoy him to the point where he says, "I'll rent it again." Moments have passed where I keep you going but I will never see this movie again.
