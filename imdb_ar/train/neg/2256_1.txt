I'll admit I've probably seen five minutes of Jerry Springer. I do not consider myself cocky, but I really think I'm above watching what's going on in his program. You should try raising yourself above that as well. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social studies event I was doing. I was told that this film has nothing to do with Springer himself, but focuses on the lives of those who will appear on "Springer". This film has been treated better, and may actually be a great insight into how pathetic these people are. I'll admit, I felt a game of sympathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all she has in life. It is sad that she feels she must continue to show Jerry in order to solve this. <br /> <br /> I really feel sorry for the appearance of Molly Hagan in this. Have you noticed that after this movie, they were basically moved to the "B" roles on TV? I will say this about Hagan. She is a very beautiful woman and smart. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her representation as she tries to play her roles with more sympathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry a scene alone. They just do not have what it takes to take a leading role. Her best work would be Angel on Herman Head (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when she went to Seinfeld as Roberta's sister.
