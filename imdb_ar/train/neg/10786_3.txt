How this movie was made with many big stars out of my will. It's a terrible clich√© with the worst work done by any of these actors. It's really surprising that many of the A-list stars agree to this strange film. What's worse is the fact that nearly 100 million here in the states. However, it is clear that big stars can flow, even if the movie is terrible. I felt sorry for all the participants in these festivals. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he gave and the rest of the stars appeared to be through suggestions. Whatever you do, do not drop off the excellent actors because no one can save this.
