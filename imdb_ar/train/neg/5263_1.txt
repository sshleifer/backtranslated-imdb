This is the worst movie I can remember watching. Everything was incredible clich√© and retarded. The acting was terrible too. The camera did not work badly, but it could not recover it. The writer / director of this film should suffer from Down Syndrome if he believes this film will help in his career. I want to bring back an hour and a half of my life until I waste this nonsense. The best video of the grass grows from this. I can not believe IMDb makes me write 10 lines for posting this, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I have to keep warning others about it. The reason I was talking about this film was that my friend asked it from the local library, believing it was Chris Christoferson's film, which ended up in "Disappearance". I do not know who is the reason this garbage is finished in my DVD player, but I feel there is someone who owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film is better to know him in the street.
