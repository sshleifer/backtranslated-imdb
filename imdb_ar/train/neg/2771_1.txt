The film was to be screened here in Bangkok with all the fuss, and even in the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> It appears that the author of the story does not carry water. There was definitely something missing. In my opinion, people should have reason to watch it, unlike a historical overview of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film lacks any material. The only way to do this film properly was to make changes in one way or another as it represented a kind of myth rather than just a story. The myth will contain some elements that try to tell you something forgotten by people over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film failed to answer, why do I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some of the mythological alien elephants, the psychic king, or the eccentric king like "King and I" could have been beautiful, and there was something that added a lot to the appeal of films. I think there was no appeal except the ordinary vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you receive the call, the story is the next thing we focus on. In marketing terms, call it a "must see". When you hear the title of the movie people will say, Oh, I must see it. Now where is the appeal at Kingmaker? Why not just return the title and name it, "How can you not be a king?" And make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, similar to "Dr. Strangelov". It could have been more interesting. Experiments that resemble the narratives of the king's first-person skills make the film very funny. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have a "must see" appeal, like Spiderman and Men X, and these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, some other films, such as The Island, would resume themselves when the ad asks "Do you still think there's an island?" <br /> <br /> For the film, the title "How do you not own" might ask "Do you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
