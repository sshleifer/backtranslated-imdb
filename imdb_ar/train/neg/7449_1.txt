Very disappointing copy of Doone Lorna. Too many lost characters, there are no romantic scenes, changes in the line of the story, too short, look low budget. Dialogue is hardly enough to understand the story if you are not familiar with the story. In some scenes, Lorna appears to have a cold infection in her upper lip. I'm sure the make-up worked to hide it. I think they did not want to stop filming until they recovered. Probably why this film lacks kissing scenes. Kissing scene is just disappointing at the end. Lorna Doone is a wonderful epic story and you must tell it truthfully. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is double its length, more romantic, more entertaining, and more realistic to the book.
