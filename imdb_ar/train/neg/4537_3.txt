I actually did not enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a camp, we did not hate him, we laughed at him. Sure, some parts are touching, but the representation is terrible, the effects are awful, and the whole idea of ​​the film as a whole is awesome (now, I know it was based on a book I did not read but I hope the book was better than this, because frankly I thought this movie was too bad And boring). As I said, I went with a group of people from a camp, and were excited about your presence there, as well as a caffeinated drink, but nevertheless struggled to stay awake. The only thing that made me wake up (as opposed to my fear of being waking up) was the useless shots. I just really did not like it.
