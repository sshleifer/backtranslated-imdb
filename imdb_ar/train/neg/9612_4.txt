Directly to the end, the bad guys have the upper hand - always - what kind of person doubts the efficiency of good players. A couple of plots of an innocent man accused of a crime that infuriates them. Some unnecessary dialogue in which various legal issues are discussed. This is just a stupid old Western humble, so what is this nonsense about trying to make things "realistic"? Cagney's unusual presence in the West is one of the few - if not the only - things in the film. Somewhere around the middle, there is a ridiculous marriage proposal. Kind of like "Where is the baby hiding? !! Where is it ?! Oh, by the way, do you marry me?"
