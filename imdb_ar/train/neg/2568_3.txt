Dear ... Peter Sellers was one of the most amazingly talented actors. But his choice of films, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He does not seem to realize how to use his talents. It was better off working with more Kubrick film world than the people who did it. Among his subsequent films, I was only fascinated by the film "Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" by those I saw. <br /> <br /> However, Boultings and Sellers have made some movies before that hardly looks bad - I have not seen Carlton Brown and the Heavens Above! - At least in the sense of using sellers fairly well. But, "there is a girl in my soup" is really a lousy film and a strong choice by sellers in terms of personality. In his films from 1955 to 1964, you can usually expect at least a very innovative development and always have a vague conviction in his roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic advance. It almost sellers are playing Neven CAD without cheerfulness. He certainly does not convince or try what he likes or creates an interesting personality. He should have left such parts to the masters of powers like Carrie Grant, and focused on those interesting dramas and comedies he was famous for. <br /> <br /> In fact, Hawn and Sellers do not create any real chemistry; this is not easy, and romance is like perfection by William Powell and Merna Lowe. It's a very artificial appearance, along the way - I know it's part of the Danvers character that it's a dry agent for ladies, but it does not really change about it in a convincing way. Sellers have a very promising way of playing "magic" too ... This character has no depth, and does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. Vendors go through the motions in a way one does not think is possible when they remember the magnificence of its terrible performance and the icons in Lolita. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about conspiracy, direction or characters, frankly leaving little or no impression. It's really one of the most I've ever seen. The lack of "vehicle" for the talents of vendors is indisputable. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
