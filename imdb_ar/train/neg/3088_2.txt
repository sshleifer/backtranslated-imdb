1. Aliens look like fancy toys and hand puppets, with arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. Foreigners are proficient in traveling through intergalactic space, but they do not know how to push an open cellar door, yet they can push an open door closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old security guards know how to get C4, and wait for the right time to use it, for example, when they are suddenly fired for no good reason. <br /> <br /> 4.

To convince your girl friend of the girl, you have to "save the world ... make mistakes ... good" foreigners. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are vulgar, either publicly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Hard night clubs look like bad food. <br /> <br /> 8. "Scummy" waitresses are doubled as dancers of the Fontaineels (how they talked about this?) who can not do just sixty bad dance steps. <br /> <br /> 9.

Obviously, gardening tools make noise on the electronic keyboard when used, not just in battles (tell me I'm not the only one to notice this). <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that this movie went wrong. interval. There is not much meat on the bone, and nothing is doing well. So average. It's just bad. However, I have seen what is much worse, and the scene of a rake fight was purely comic, intentional or otherwise gone. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Freaky 4 was even worse.
