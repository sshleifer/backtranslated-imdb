This is a movie about making a movie. These movies may be amusing, but they need some content, to do so. This has not happened here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (his sister did not succeed, she could make films that one might see). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: The main actor, who is supposed to be a director, is just crossing like a frozen squid and has his voice in the same stadium whatever he says, and her leading actress has an expression on her face that never shows changes, With perhaps one touch element, the film inside the idea of ​​the film should be more damaged than the old stone rocks ... Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regret every moment I saw this movie. Walking with the dog is the very superior entertainment of this incredibly lame movie. It looks like the plot of François Truffaut, directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF movies? Must be really kidding ...
