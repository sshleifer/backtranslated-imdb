If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, do not care about Bedjaoui. The film is hardly worth mentioning alongside A list works such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even good material like The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of minutes, unexpected images, rich characters, and non-Western films are no doubt what is scary. Ghawi has been linked with his limbs and the remains of everything that has made American terror lousy over the past 25 years. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to blend the story of Asian ghosts and flick with Hollywood, but it's a bad fit movie. One aesthetic must suffocate the other. Guess which? The lack of a story of their own to tell the filmmakers looted Ringo for an evil subterfuge, but the situation is desperate. Cliches, nonsense characters, conspiracy without fear, dull ghost, hum.
