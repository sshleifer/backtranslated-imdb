One can wish a good idea like the "hidden man" to work better and be handled more carefully in an age of great special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the last 20 minutes of the film, are just as new as a flick of a crazy world since the early 1950s. There are some wonderful moments, mostly because of the amazing special effects and the idea of ​​an invisible man chasing the streets. Unfortunately, we soon returned to the narrow confinement of the underground laboratory, which meant that the rest of the film was not only predictable, but schematic. <br /> <br /> Movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have the charm. But it became clearer and more clear to each film that the idea of ​​putting ol classics under the watchful eye of mad enthusiasts like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is a very bad idea. Money is clearly the main issue here: the time and energy that have been put into the script is not close enough, and as a result, the "hollow man" is seriously undermined with clichés, happy characters, predictability and no depth at all. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that really impressed me, along with the special effects, is the section. When making this type of film, modern producers are keen to let children see it. Therefore, language (and sometimes violence and sex) is greatly reduced. When the whole world explodes, good men go, "O darn!" And "my God". The "hollow man" gratefully ignores this kind of hypocrisy and the characters have the freedom to say what is more natural to them. I'm not saying that the natural response to something wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
