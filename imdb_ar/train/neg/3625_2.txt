This film belongs strongly to the 1950s. Surprisingly, the American Film Institute chose this film as one of the top 100 American films ever. I've practically watched all the movies listed on that list, and this movie is by far the most frustrating film. Musical numbers (many of them many) are very long and boring, and have no absolute connection to the story. The end of the film contains a terribly long ballet series, which of course has nothing to do with the story of the film. It must be recognized that it is well made, the music is fine, and the dance is at the highest professional level - but there is no real reason to insert the sequence into the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is very childish and undesirable and behaves in an impolite way. His mental age is about 14 years. If you want to see a good musician made on the "golden age" of musicals, go to see "Singing in the Rain".
