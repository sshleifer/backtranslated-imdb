Not because Caligula had thought about turning the film off halfway ... .but then with this movie, I was only in 15 minutes when I thought. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you do not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking, bloody, scary, scary, or sexual. It is not any of these things, yet she desperately wants them to be all. Instead, they are boring, vulgar, ordinary, predictable, and badly unpredictable (filmed on video, high school influences, meaningless even to the basic storytelling, barely audible dialogue ... not worth hearing) ) /> <br /> This film is proof of the argument that even live video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
