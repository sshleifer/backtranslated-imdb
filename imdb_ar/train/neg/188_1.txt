This film has a beautiful scene. Unfortunately he has no plot. In order to get a conspiracy there must be a conflict. This film was nothing. I spent two hours drawing a beautiful scene and failing to put any activity into it. The picture tries to be artistic but fails to focus on the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love the scenery of Montana and fly fishing, you will find some value in this movie just do not expect a story. There is no one.
