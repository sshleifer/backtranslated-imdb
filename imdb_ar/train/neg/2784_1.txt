My husband and I are two parents and a small autistic boy lives in the same town as a screenwriter for this film. We were deeply disturbed that the JCC brought this film to the Jewish Film Festival because of the way in which the mentally retarded Frankie was depicted. We went to see this film in the local theater when it came out. We asked for money back. We encourage the scriptwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the JCC's Achad program for an apology. <br /> <br /> We did not want to see Frankie - a mentally handicapped teenager and perhaps even an autistic - as part of a joke in which he continues to drop something to look at the nanny's breasts. <br /> <br /> There was no sense to Frankie's character except to say, "Hey, being mentally disabled is funny." Challenges like Frankie are a serious issue. Families like my family really suffer. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter needs to explain itself. Do you know families with children with disabilities? Do families with disabled children see week after week the JCC swimming pool?
