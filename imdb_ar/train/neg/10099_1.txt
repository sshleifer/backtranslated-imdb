Thank God! I did not waste my money on renting it but I downloaded it! This happens to be the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life, visual effects, unnecessary obstruction! Away from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and more. There are a lot of loop holes and mistakes in the film. Well, if you got a time after reading this comment, please review the profile of the manager (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I got a self-explanation of why this movie came about, I mean that every film directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating of between 1 and 2. Now I'm not ready to look for kinda movies that are directed by him, but I can finish each This is one strong sentence. So for fun or time or even in a very boring position, please do not watch this movie.
