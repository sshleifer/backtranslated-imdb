In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Aircraft, Trains and Cars", which was a hilarious and moving comedy? The best thing to do at all. Ten years later, it was recycled into a "Home Alone" plot again in this second part, unrelated to other films but equally unhelpful and poetic. The four crooks? That's right, four! One of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, to introduce this revolutionary change in the chain! ?? Exposed to metal chairs, equipped with four blind with paint, ha ha ha ha ha, while the new baby less magic than the Kolkin. You think that the departure of almost all the major players from the first two films would prevent Hughes from scaling the same old routine, but the only surprise is that he did not attend "Home Alone 4".
