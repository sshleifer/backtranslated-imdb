"Cut" is a film about some film students making a film. It is largely in the form of "yelling," a self-righteous, self-righteous horror that, to me at least, falls because, despite its paradoxes, it is still a horror film, like the movies it refers to. </ P> <br /> But it was not without its charm. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was as wonderful as a corrupt American actress who hates every minute of working with amateur Australian film crews. She was so convincing that she was tempted to think that it was not a job, although all Cut participants said it was nice to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her frown, tinkle or footage was great. However, everyone else was thrown between his asses and being terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Cut has some laugh and some buckets of clothes (some of them amazingly scary), and in the end it is another horror horror movie.
