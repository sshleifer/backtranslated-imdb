This film draws the line between satire and absurdity. While the bridge system which has no rules may encourage marital harmony, it certainly can not encourage the bridge to be a winner, so the spelling did not benefit me but there were some things that I found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lucas and Ferdinand Guchshal near the end of the film. Treats like a boxing match. Not only is the circuit in a square area such as the boxing ring, there is a referee hovering among the contestants, and radio announcer Rosco Carnes delivers a non-stop speech at the event. At one point, he even counted "one ... two ... three ... four ..." as if an offer of four diamonds represents a knockout. People were taped on their radios for everything, a common event for boxing matches. This spoof has already worked well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors present the comedy necessary to maintain the intended spelling. Paul Lucas does not have much taste for comedy and he is wrong. Beautiful Loretta Young and the usual Frankie McHugh comedy did not give good enough lines. Glenda Farrell has a lovely comic role as a forgotten blonde at the beginning of the film, but it practically disappears afterwards. What a waste of talent!
