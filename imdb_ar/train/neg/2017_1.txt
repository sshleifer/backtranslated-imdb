This plot is reasonable but normal, a beautiful and neglected wife of a rich and strong man with a hustle and bustle, then tries to cover her up like her psychological legs and vibrate. But what is developing from there is irrationally disturbing. Despite the resources available to the usual couple who have money and influence, our hero and heroine seem to have one local official, their lawyers and the local police (who say they can not do anything) at their disposal while dealing with thrill and terrorism. They do not have special security personnel (only a luxury security system to deal with), family officers, land employees, drivers, etc. Not even, it seems, funds to hire special nurses around the clock to take care of the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries, leaving the man and wife alone and the weak in their palace. Our heroine is portrayed as the brains of the knob and that our hero, a pole, acts in the most likely and irrational way. This show is an insult to viewers who have lost their time with this leadership and a crime to waste the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hase and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). The shame on Lifetime TV is to insult the intelligence of its audience for this hidden show.
