This film was so awful, so I feel uncomfortable and describe it as a film. It is a typical "mumblecore" film, with a zero-sum plot and a handful of twenty-something aimless stumbling around trying to "discover things". I've tried to give a chance to mumblecore, but let's be honest it's just a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of sync with the movies, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies all the time. So I do not mind if the film was made cheaply as long as there was a substance (ie). <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is horrific, acting, writing (or everything was improvised?), the direction, but most of all, above all, the camera was just simple nonsense. The camera was never logical, and there was no consistency. I must admit that I was a young man I had heard that there was nudity in this film, so I thought of myself well even if there was at least awful (I knew, I jerked). Well, thanks to the crappy uber camera, you will never see anything, the things you see, trust me - you do not want to see. This film made me want to vomit on several levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me want to vomit, and the work of the camera made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that some critics of the movie praised. Well, now more than anything that makes me want to vomit.
