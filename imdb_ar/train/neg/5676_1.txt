This film shows a section of the deformation of live animals of an animal exposed to piracy by a sickle and separated skin. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I'm watching does not actually happen on screen. These live videos are not meant to be in films, but to show people belonging to certain organizations to help the terrible things that humans do to do other kinds. <br /> <br /> This must be banned and destroyed. I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to cooperate in getting this movie out of the market !! <br /> <br /> This movie must be removed from the public. The person making the film needs psychological help.
