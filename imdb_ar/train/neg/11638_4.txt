"The Blood of the Sacred, the Blood of the Mad" is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight Games, a series of adventure games about supernatural detective / writer Gabriel Knight. Prince James of Albany of Gabriel and his companion Grace asked to investigate a series of mysterious attacks called "night visitors". When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel follows the nightly visitors to Rennes-le-Chateau, where he begins to assemble a mystery about the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite marketing, this game does not revolve around vampires. Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but do not take center stage, as the voodoo did in the "sins of the fathers" or wolves in the "beast inside." Gabriel and Grace do not try to reveal the true nature of the vampires, or look for science in the vampires. Although vampires kill three people during the game, their victims are randomly chosen and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Much of Gabriel Knight's first two charms were the installments in Gabriel's relationship with the bad guys. Through these relationships, the player can only sympathize with the villain, thus turning the villain into more than one person and less than the monsters. However, in the "Blood of the Sacred" interaction, Gabriel interacts with the villain through an individual cheesy interview, which does not distort the villain of the player. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gabriel and Grace. In this puzzle is somewhat futile. Gabriel spends his time snooping on the identities of the members of the tourist treasures group staying at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing but a red rose. Grace spends her time searching for the mystery of Rennes le Château, but all of her research has become unnecessary because of a puzzling ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this puzzlement. Ally and reverse polar counterpart --- vampire leader --- unsupportable. The ally leaves hints of Rennes le Château's mystery in broad daylight and is expected to be found by Grace (not the other treasure hunters from the tour group). However, the mystery could have been completely revealed on the first day, instead of endangering the abducted child for an additional 48 hours. In the end, Grace simply tells the whole mystery anyway. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the vampire leader failed to achieve the goals of centuries of planning, because he chose to refrain from working for two days after the kidnap. The only reason given for his decision to delay work is that he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game was much better if it were focused exclusively on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and vampires should have been removed, replaced by a race against the Vatican to reveal the secret of Rennes le Château. Because Gabriel was repeatedly portrayed as a reluctant Catholic, this conflict would have had many opportunities for personal development. <br /> <br /> In general, the game was a disappointing batch in the series, despite the improvement of the front and the return of Tim Curry voice Gabriel Knight.
