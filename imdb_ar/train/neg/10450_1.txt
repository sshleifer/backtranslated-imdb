This film was the worst film I've seen since the movie's history. I was laughing by taking out the whole movie instead of fear. It was funny how the snakes searched for a particular section of the passenger's body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt and the breast. If we see a national geographic channel, we know that the snakes will not remain confined to the body as soon as they bite. For each particular scene, snakes will trap the passengers and remain on the body biting. I think the product did not study its information about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money in this film. So, I do not recommend this documentary, just wait until it is shown on the dollar stage or rented.
