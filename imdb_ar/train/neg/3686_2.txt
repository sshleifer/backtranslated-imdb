I am surprised that everyone (even critics) think this is a good film. It was the most exciting film I have ever seen. We have a "bad man" who wants to force the "good man" (or girls in this case) to do something or face the result. The "good girl" in this film must use her intelligence and skills to defeat the "bad guy" and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, courage, and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Recreat meets a young man named Jackson Ribbner (a nice name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and it soon seems as if fate brings these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly all the way in all ... Is there more to this strange? Can these two mean to each other? Does "fate" have a reason for their strange and indiscriminate confrontation? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turned out, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Internal Security Director by moving him from room to room so that his men can attack him. Oh, if she did not do this her father would have died. Although we never learn the specific reasons for the reason behind this madness and who really stands behind it, Jackson explains more than that how this will happen and why it is in Lisa's interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa defeated his evil plans with her smart and in the process of stabbing him in the neck, making him ride on the chairs, and hit him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, you lead him in a wild chase through Miami airport, where she is passed after security guard number 11, and steals a car she later used to run on the man who ordered her father to be killed. <br /> <br /> Yes, well. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson can put his hands on high tech weapons and needs the help of a hotel manager. Can not a bomb slip into the building? Does not that make it safer for him and for the team by leaving any third parties? Why do characters like Jackson explain everything they would do to someone who threatened him? Are not they easily prevented by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best to look at the film that was presented to them. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still looking for them. Also, I think that Jaime Mays (who played the role of "beloved Cynthia") would be someone we would see more. It is very bad that they are all stuck in this. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
