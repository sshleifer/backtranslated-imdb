Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on her. Who do film producers think they are? The absolute worst, most unreal films I have seen as long as I can remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to subscribe to IMDb and make sure that this movie's rating was low. <br /> <br /> omg I'm Heather Graham, I have accepted a drunk chick, during her death, I will go quickly around my room for hours frantically asking myself "What did you do?" .. Jesus Heather, overcome it and grow ... and I want to redirect that feeling toward the producers of Idiot ... While I am, instead of being the entire film about the pathetic excuse for an upcoming story, perhaps the most appropriate focus of the plot on a non-character Mentally stable. After all, I know the first time I have sex, when I left the next morning I jumped into the sky in an atmosphere of excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * ch, get a grip ... <br /> <br /> What a joke! And please note that there are many flaws and a lot of stupid dumb aspects of this lame flick, but I'm so fed up of thinking about it anymore. In short, if you're smart, you'll hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, you'll love it ... It's that simple.
