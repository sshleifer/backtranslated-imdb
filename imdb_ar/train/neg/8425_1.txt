Truly a disgusting, rude film, with only a small amount of real humor. <br /> <br /> The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme (deliberately, obviously), and portrayed in a more pathetic, unnatural way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this movie terribly disturbing, with no alternative features at all. Frankly, I wish I had not seen him before. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort embarrassing and serious. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this movie have a capacity that is utterly lacking: to be joyful in a show of deep corruption and filth. <br /> <br /> Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
