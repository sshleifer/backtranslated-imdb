It's a shame that this film has made it actually directed to the video market, which aroused my shame on my proud - any attempt to watch this movie nonstop or pause, would be a futile attempt. One can not bear to see more than one hour of it, then sleep, or visit the bathroom for coloring. <br /> <br /> Note: If you do not see anything else from Denmark, please remember this: <br /> <br /> Some things were not supposed to be - but some fool still goes ahead and makes it Status!
