This movie looked fun; I read the book a few years ago and told me that this feature follows the outline chart very tightly. <br /> <br /> I started watching it and almost from the start, it failed to live up to expectations. In fact, I did not bother watching everything ... absolute drive - bad performances, bad acting and characters you do not like right away - that was the point of the film, I guess. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in my mouth and put me in the lower back for the rest of the weekend. <br /> <br /> You do not care about this feature.
