Well, this is a typical film "straight to the toilet". <br /> <br /> A long short story, a group of teenagers / young adults stranded in the midst of creepy forests and infiltrated by bare demons. <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the fundamentals of this harmful section: <br /> <br /> - naked women, teenagers or young adults stranded somewhere in the terrifying terrifying scenes of death somewhere . The survivor is a well-built young woman who will always show off her chest, but never less than her chest - a creepy and crazy man who knows about the evil evil kiss scene, a murderer, and no conspiracy <br /> <br /> Even in a cheesy , It was so bad. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even explicit sex scenes, was enough to keep the male and lesbian audience interested. I felt watching him as if he were being watched with a thinning of the head or a cold in the head. <br /> <br /> Give a demon ..... 0/10.
