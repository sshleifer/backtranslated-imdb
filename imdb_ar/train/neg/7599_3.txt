A friend told me about John Vanty last summer after we entered into an interview about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Vanty was a favorite writer for Bukowski - an author who had the same humor and humor only from a generation earlier. "Ask Dust" was the first book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a wonderful piece of writing about a sad young writer who was afraid to pretend to himself and to the outside world as a very confident author, and had no idea how to write about the experiences of the real world he did not have any of them. In the novel the hero is a virgin, and he has no idea how to gain the grace of women who desperately wish to write about him in magazines. The story of his strange relationship with Camilla, how he settles his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how he ultimately has nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is a true story, with no touch of Hollywood ending. The adaptation of the films remains true to the book for a while, but it lurks in the trap of persistent cinematic love through racism, disease and death. The essence of this story lies in the fact that Pandini is a rattle and Camilla is crazy, and that their love has never been and never will be the real thing, no matter how much they want to find each other. This film has torn the true meaning of the story and replaced it with your behavior. I can not believe that the man who wrote China Town could read this book and made a film about it made a mistake.
