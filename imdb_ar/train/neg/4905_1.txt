I am usually disappointed with network movies. Flix is ​​often destroyed which attracts great name representatives by people TV. However, this one is the worst. The film's script is weak and the acting, especially the representation of Tracy Pollan is repugnant. I stumbled to see the plays of my school children and were treated better. Polan behaves as if she reads the text as she speaks. When you try to express fear, anger or sadness, it is very hollow. Because of the overall quality of production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to brave this one just be prepared for great disappointment. Horrible things will not make you sad, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel warm and ambiguous, are likely to be as anxious as I see the end of the end "the first to die" says a lot about this film.
