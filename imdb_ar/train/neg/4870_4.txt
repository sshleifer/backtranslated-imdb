The film is bad Nothing special - just a movie "baby" with nothing serious in it. Although there is one reason to watch this: Talking Animal. Some of them are very funny as they say, you can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a dog pound say "I Keyser Soze", or another animal says "You're a dead cat walking", or many other funny bushings, watch it. There is no good movie to watch. Rating: 4 out of 10.
