I have not seen children's movies for years, so I missed "Come on the Tigers" when I first came out. (I never saw "Bad News Bears" even though I worked in the 1970s for the guys who arranged for the movie Warriors, The Man Who Will Be King and Rocky Horror, among others.) Now I like to check From old or small films, I find people who entered into wonderful careers even though they are in a film less than wonderful early. Only minutes after this film, I could not get away from it and jump to the end to see if there was a young actor in this film who followed bigger and better things - at least watching his appearance / appearance would be of some interest as the plot and the acting did not do the job. Here, she was spied on the name of Wes Craven in credits as an electrician. He has already made two or three of his early shocks but has not yet created Freddie Krueger or making "Screaming" movies. Maybe he had an interest and helped in this picture. The most surprising is the unique c. Lincoln in the movie "Isob", a strange character in the film. Lincoln, from the 1970s to just a few years, appeared in adult films. I have associated with the adult parody "The Ozporns", and this title is more entertaining than all the "tigers" attempts at humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor has been placed in a children's film is an indication of how the people making the film should be asleep on the wheel.
