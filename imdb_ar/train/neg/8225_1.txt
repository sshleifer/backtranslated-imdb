You do not see this unfortunate sorrow for a movie. I wasted a lot of time and money in this, so I miss it. <br /> <br /> Acting with high school plays is similar. The scenario is appalling. There is no conspiracy. Twenty minutes after the end (which I think I should be rewarded for) I had a headache from all the screaming, crying and crying of the five girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence (rare for a film at present rather than a graphic, but I found the characters so irritating that I wanted to see it, but everyone involved in making this piece dies in the most horrible way possible. br> <br /> <br /> I spend another 10 minutes in my life to save you from the very bad 100 minutes of your life.
