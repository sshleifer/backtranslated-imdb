A typical greek chick (Rainbow Harvest looks like the cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) lives with people who feel they've made a mistake with the help of an old-looking mirror found in the new house, her mother (the mainstay horror, Karen Black, and the only good thing remotely about this farce) Buy. The effect is very bad (especially when the rainbow reacts with the mirror above) and there are no fears or suspense. This film was inexplicably born for this to 3 consequences each a little more horrific than the past. People who are looking for a distinct but excellent film quest are looking for the episode "Friday 13: The Series" where an eccentric genius girl finds an old compact mirror cursed. Which contains chills in only 40 minutes of this full privilege I have made over 4 movies. <br /> <br /> My estimate: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling offers T & A mandatory
