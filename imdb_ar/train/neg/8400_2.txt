Not even the most enthusiastic fans may like the film, (I'm one of them) enthusiasts do not give any material to work with them. It's really sad because it's the only long film the devotees have made with Kirlie, and this effort they've done before is painful, when it could have great potential. The awful music numbers do not help either. And the short they did with the same title has more laughter.
