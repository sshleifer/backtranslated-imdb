Like most of the comments I saw this movie under the name The Witching which is the title of the reissue. It seems that recalling the original life is better but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes of witchcraft still contain most of the scenes of conjunctions and these are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of magic has added at least some entertainment value! But do not be fooled, there are only 3 scenes with nudity, it's for people who stand around diversity. There is no arrogant grudge by diabolique! <br /> <br /> This is a very bad film where it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is awful and direct from Troma's closet. At least Troma is the tongue in the cheek though. This boredom is directly facial embody. Variable acting with Pamela Franklin (Flora's daughter-owned The Innocents Is Incredible!) Worse through her loud, high-pitched voice. Welles looks just waiting for his check. The other face of the female has a creepy face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! The doctor is very, very bad. It is also troublingly similar to Jane Wilder. <br /> <br /> He was filmed inappropriately by scenes that change without reason, and the editing is intermittent. This is because magic is a copy and paste task and not a hidden task in it. Only the lighting is fine. The sound is also appalling and difficult to hear through the horrible new soundtrack that never closes. The mother of the "ghost" is also a litter but the actress is so bad in acting that she provides at least some unintentional laughs. <br /> <br /> Truly, this movie (at least charming) is for those interested only. There can be many sane fans because it is highly unreliable and I have found it really mindless! <br /> <br /> It was the best thing when the credits went down - it's enough to simply say this bad excuse for a movie like Plague!
