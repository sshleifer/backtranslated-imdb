This "debut" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I'm speechless" I'm registered today so I can watch it tonight after work. I had great hopes, and now I'm tearing the cupboards that are looking for a rope length so I can hang myself. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would like to say something nice like "It was fun to enjoy this movie" but this film does not give me anything to do. I know that the spoilers are not supposed to be published here without warning but I'm going anyway "this movie sucks" there I said it! They must show this click to show students what they do not do! My nine-year-old daughter can make a better film. The only thing appropriate in this movie is the audio and / or audio track. Oh! I just found a rusty C-clamp in the old toolbox. I will put it on my thumb from my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes saw. I can only sign up on this VHS tape, but I think I'll burn it in a fire hole instead. I can wash with soap but I'm afraid I will not be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to those you hate. Mike
