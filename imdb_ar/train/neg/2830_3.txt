If Ashanti was a serious attempt at a film about Slavery, still in the Third World, the film might have been better received. Instead, it turns into a star-studded disaster for a movie in which stars, according to their lines, received their checks without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Keane and his wife, Beverly Johnson, work at the United Nations. And are engaged in their humanitarian work in East Africa. Along, comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough pork to do part of it as a Muslim slave merchant. Since Johnson is black, he is caught anyway with a large number of children and a few adults as well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cayenne does not deal with the hijacking and spends the rest of the film in a rescue attempt. The rest of the actors have people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film star Big Handy in parts and looking incredibly bored with everything. <br /> <br /> Normally something like this gifted like those mentioned above will only overreact and overreact to a diet of scenery. But Ashanti does not even have that. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The smell of the tax cut off permeates the air.
