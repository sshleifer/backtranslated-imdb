Before I started watching the show, I heard it was wonderful and aesthetically pleasing. What a fool, the texts are so stupid that I am sure that the authors are the son and grandson of the scopedo book. What about the SFX and the colors, they are so extreme that it's painful to see them, the colors are not saturated, they are saturated, like overwriting, exaggerated and overpriced. This offer is like a bad pie in which the child will only put sugar and butter in the belief that these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this offer, the only two components of this offer are ultimately a vacuum and a complete lack of credibility.
