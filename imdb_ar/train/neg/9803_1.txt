Power Rangers is definitely the worst television show and a completely ridiculous plastic game production line in US history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing amusing about this appalling TV show. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with horrible actors dressed in multicolored spandex clothes that look absolutely silly. <br /> <br /> Owners should be ashamed of this offer of themselves, because there is no value to recovering this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's kids should try to watch better programs like Toy Story instead of trash.
