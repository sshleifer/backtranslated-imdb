I write this because I somehow felt that I had led to the belief that Dark Remains was a good film. Although it is not the worst I have seen, it is definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Poor script, weak actors, and weak steering. Even if they can not bear the name of a great representative, is it necessary to ask a more attractive representative? It was painful to see a clear actress during the film with its poor performance. The story was clich√© and bad writing. The special effects were slim. It was hard to swallow the "thrill" tricks used frequently here. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains remains worse than some Masters of Horrors. But not quite on par with the quality of movies yet. Dark Remains is recommended only for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss a movie in this genre, even if it's a bad-made movie. As for anyone else, you have to spend time on something more valuable - which is very easy.
