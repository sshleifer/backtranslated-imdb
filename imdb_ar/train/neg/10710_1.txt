Dolph Lundgren acts as the temple that comes to New York when the archaeologist finds a key to unlock Christ. Of course, Satan is only a few miles away from Dolph and is not easily killed as he moves from body to body. (Like fallen without suspense) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the film is irresistible. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies whenever it's on TV. I caught the client and the boy was disappointed. This movie is very bad. With the sequence of events badly organized and badly edited, you can barely make sense in the battlefield. The worst of all is that Lundgren's wonderfully unprovoked perfume as a powerful priest made it all the worse that the film became such as Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad but better) Is the worst film I've ever seen of Dolph Lundgren. Literally he has nothing to recommend. It's awful and this is the lowest point in Lundgren's career. I saw cover-up, the final warrior and the professors of the universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out of 4- (Awful)
