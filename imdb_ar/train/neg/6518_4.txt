The film is very funny and contains four dates, then it becomes a blatant commercial ad for someone you can not stand up to (even "friends"). It is a very interesting concept; film dates on the quest to find true love in modern Los Angeles. The problem is that it feels incredibly (and badly) sometimes and boosts itself starkly. It is difficult to pay attention to any person or attract people because the writer / actor is very cocky, uninformed, incorrect, and simply undesirable. You end up feeling sorry for his dates.
