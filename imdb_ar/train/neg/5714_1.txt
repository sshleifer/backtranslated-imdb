I've seen many good Korean movies, including thriller and darker movies, but they suck. The director seems to have been sadia, where he got someone to produce some waste. The film lacks any kind of entertainment value and is not even a suspense film. I can not believe someone really made a film like this. Although acting is fine, the story line and the feeling that it leaves a bad thing. <br /> <br /> I'm sure, I will not watch any movies for this director. No sense to the film industry, absolute disappointment in the presence of exciting moments. All this presents the viewer with a mentally ill waste virgin with very bad scenes and shows more blood and violence thinking that makes it exciting. Very disappointing film and I highly recommend skipping all the films of this kind.
