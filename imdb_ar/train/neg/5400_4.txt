This is just a short of the whole blown Gore Festival based on Stephen King's story. Two tabloid newspapers, one of them seasoned (Miguel Ferrer) and the other did not do so (Julie Intusell), in the belief that the serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may already be a vampire. Curiously more curious is that this blood sucker in modern times does not stand in his way normally, but by Cessna Black looking for his victims. In fact, the ghost becomes appalling as the film approaches its stupid end. Keep in mind that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit it was a bit scary in the early hours of the night.
