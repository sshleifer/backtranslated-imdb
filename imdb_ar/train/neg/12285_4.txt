The story is vague and lame, and the suction is also presentations and dialogue, difficult to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a caffeine-friendly friend handy to wake you up in time for a couple of Gore effects. Why do they bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All the time, you wonder about the purpose of this film? Chock is full of lame sub-groups (like the US Army Commander in Cannibalism) this low-grade film in every aspect. This movie is banned in Germany !!
