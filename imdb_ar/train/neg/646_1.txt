I saw this film by accident and this film was an accident ... it should have been. The blond women who are chased, the villain appears and then disappear and they get from one place to another in a minute and then disappear and reappear again, hidden. He was not even a great hero so I do not know how he did it. Cat This is not difficult. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary. In fact, it has stopped being scary for years. You had the policeman on the path of the villain, another cliche (played by Idris Elba in a very convincing American accent, he is from London) the director had no idea and made a movie full of clich√© and taking a "scary step" which was a scary comic look.
