Suzanne Sarandon was always impressed by her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actress. I found it strange to appear in a film that distorts those facts. Her character was rescued from the South Pole by a Canadian chartered company from Edmonton, Alberta, flying on a designed and designed twin-twin aircraft from Canada. The flight was rejected by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard because it exceeded its capabilities. The same company saved similar a few years later to take out a man from the Antarctic base. I feel that the film is, to some extent, a wonderful subject and documenting a very courageous woman facing a frightening task. Failed to find out why producers find it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and to show the rescue aircraft as Hercules of the US Air Force.
