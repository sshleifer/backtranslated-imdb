No matter what you look at this film, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> If you look at him as a sponsor, it's a scary movie with monsters being hand-drawn. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, you will notice that most humor collapses and is lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a romantic love story, you'll wonder why a man stays with such a person ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a measure, you can not really attract the little hero. <br /> <br /> As you watch this movie, it fails only to offer anything remotely entertained. As we mentioned the monsters are clear puppets and this film was another attempt for a movie of the type Gremlins. This however has the worst monsters of this kind. The creatures looked good, as did the Goleins, so that the dolls of the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are highly undesirable. The hero is a security guard and his girlfriend always complains, she has a hobo friend who has a lousy military girlfriend, and another friend is a friend. At some point in the film, the hero and the military man fought with a rake ... This film is completely stupid. I like the scene when they are in the scum of the dreaded club (which is obviously not a club, but it is likely to be dinner) and tell the waitress hero that no one of them is 21 years old. Give me leave, I'm 25 years old and I look younger than any of them.
