The original Trancers is by no means a fantastic movie. It had huge plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. However, he was amused, the best performer of most B films with low budget, and could be amazingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not any of these. <br /> <br /> Trancers II has many of the same problems for most backward sequences. The plot is thin enough to see if the writing is inaccurate. It seems that the people behind this film felt that the familiar faces of the first film would be enough, and nothing else bothered them. Even veteran actors like Tim Thompson and Jeffrey Combs could not pull the film out of the mud. <br /> <br /> An Overview of the Plot Summary: Jack Deith (Thomerson) is a policeman from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of his cabinet members. Trancers II occurs six years after the first Trancers events. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first film, both live with Ash Ashby, the man who sent Death to the past to protect him. It has been discovered that Whistler's brother (the bad guy from the first film) has come back in time to create an army of homeless people, turning people into a reckless murder zombie, to kill Ashby. The complexity of Jack's task is the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack's travel to the past, was also brought back to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack finds himself working with her. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this film differs radically from the methods used in the first film. What makes it disturbing is that, in a rather poor example of Soviet distortion, they behave as if they were always the method. <br /> <br /> The other thing that bothers me is that the love triangle between Deith and Lena and Alice Steelwell (Jack's first wife) is given a little screen time. This particularly annoyed me because it was more interesting than the actual plot of the film. I felt it was just something that was thrown to fill the space in the film. Alice's character in particular is not interested in the fact that she reunited with her husband only to find him married, making her either too shallow or badly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently totaling six movies). Otherwise, even if you are a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this lukewarm sequel.
