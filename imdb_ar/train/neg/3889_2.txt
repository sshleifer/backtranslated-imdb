I always wanted to see this because I love the cheese horror movies and with such a nickname, I was sure that the "Amazing Fusion Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> That was not really the case. I mean, the acting was surprisingly bad, the text had some classic bad lines and the special effects seemed to be sneezing all over the main actor, so I should have liked it. Unfortunately, it's really full of vitality among these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the film during my tax return. This is the boring way of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies, you will enjoy the dramatic departure of the Fat nurse, and the wonderful representation of the person playing Dr. Ted. In order to be fair to the poor man, he has to offer some unsettling lines with a straight face - such as his conversation with his wife about tracking the chat man: <br /> <br /> "I'll find him with a geiger counter." "Is it radiant?" "Just a little bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a plot Ted Ted Ted about trying to find a zombie zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan failed when he found a lot of sticky on a tree. "My God - it's his ear!" Dr Ted says to the public. I'm very happy because he cleared it. <br /> <br /> I realized I was making this movie look rather fun. It would be if it was just 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, the "stunning mind melt" just about makes a sticky mess when more people should eat in my opinion. I think if you've really stoned, you probably do not like it, you just do not have pop-ups during the movie, because the main actor really looks like a close-up shape.
