Like most people, I've been attracted to buying this movie because of the powerful photos of Bolo Yeung affixed all over the box, the assumption (from the above pictures and the title of the movie) that this movie is all about the monster of Kikan East ass for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, my disappointment, Chinese Hercules is to Julio Young what was no retreat No surrender of the committees of Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was ... Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure in the video box, the minimum time Actual screen! Oh, okay! <br /> <br /> The story is fairly basic, but well-executed - the peaceful Kung Fu fighter (played by Chen Huimin) kills a man accidentally and never fights. He then runs off to work as a worker on a pier where his colleagues at work marvel at the skill of lifting heavy bags, which makes them suspect he is a huge fighter (not sure how he does it but does not mind). At the same time, the corrupt head of the dock deals with gangsters, allowing them to use the dock exclusively. As a result, the workers are thrown to their ear and forced to live on the beach, challenging their boss, gang leader, and great cleric Paul Young. <br /> <br /> While the film was very funny (mainly by waiting for the next glimpse of Polo), I had some problems with it - first, the bad dubbing, but of course this is mentioned in the old Kung Fu movies. But also, the film tends to draw between different fighting scenes. As for the scenes of the fighting itself, they were found to be too long, poorly designed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Sometimes shot and carried by people who did not appear to have any martial arts ability. In fact, most of the battles in this film were not "fighting" at all, but people were beaten without any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - played by Chen Huimin. I've never seen any other movies with this guy, but at any given time I've been dating him. Not only did he appear on the brink of crying at all times, but I found his insistence on not fighting the anger! I understood his logic, but he could save a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he would do in the end and fight! The biggest mystery was why this entire community of people pinned their hopes on someone who had never even seen fighting! <br /> <br /> Truly, the great blessing in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is it as huge and brutal as before, it has wonderful and funny lines and gives the rest of the actors a key layer about how to fight on the movie. The guy drops the screen and you can easily see how he became a star. The man scares life from me, but I'm sure I was not the only person who saw this film that was rooted for Polo throughout the final battle! <br /> <br /> In general, the Kung Fu movie has lowered the average of many huge cracks because of your knowledge. I never met anyone who did not think Polo Young was fantastic. The man is a legend !!
