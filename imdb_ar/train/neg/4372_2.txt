I love without a knot, let me say it in advance! It is a tremendous talent and the best he does, which depicts a lovingly disappointed loser thrown in power. It's wonderful in this role like Roy Fleming, the hesitant astronaut, but the film is rather boring, really, although I'm a little girl and I'm delighted to watch this and his other films. It's still worth watching, but it's really a movie enjoyed by children. She has rated her 100% family friend and something you can sit and watch with your children on a family night. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts movies, there are a host of favorite characters and actors and you can only smile when Knotts introduces a vibrating and open star, no matter how old you are and bothers you. <br /> <br /> From an adult point of view, one thing I think is wonderful in this film is how NASA captures the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, and future! I was surprised how Leslie Nielsen was appalling and nervous at the time. The only complaint about the story is Roy's interest in love, a woman unwanted and undesirable and can not give him time to become a great person - if you're like me, you're hoping to give her a grind in the end. Beware - the tone will be ringing for several days after viewing, it is attractive.
