It's hard to say what's the worst thing about this show: bad acting, poor acoustics for different parts, bad CGI, inappropriate groups for this period, weak text. It would have been good to follow the text of the original story a little closer - there is enough tension and good materials in BioFlue to provide a great deal of good material, and a better story line than a screenwriter. /> <br /> Why does it offer a strange new weapon such as a bow and fire that release explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I think this movie was made in only 21 days. This shows the lack of quality. I started to think that this is the general (bad) attitude of Sci-Fi (and others) when it comes to filming classic stories in the last few years. <br /> <br />!
