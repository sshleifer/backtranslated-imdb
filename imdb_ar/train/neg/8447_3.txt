I do not know what I missed here, but I can not believe all of these positive comments for many people on this film. I think it was silly, and a bit above the top. I liked the offers of Greg Henry and Michael Rucker, but others were just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, I really liked, but this was a bit more than the alphabet for me. I saw someone comparing humor and horror in this with the Army of Darkness and Shawn the Dead, as well as On The Same As The Re-Animator. You must be kidding. I did not find this movie funny, I tried, I made an effort, (maybe a lot of effort), but it failed in my opinion. By the time I was in third or fourth grade, I was watching my eyes and checking my watch. <br /> <br /> There have certainly been greetings to many other films, which have always been wonderful, like a joke inside for us horror fans. But here may be just a lack of original thought. Admittedly there are some beautiful special effects, good paper, but can not carry the entire film. The transformed grant seemed to be a cross between the meal of Eve, and in the early stages of the boom - Cheet of the "strange science" (after turning into the beast) and one of the strange creature / children of "explorers." It just did not work. I thought it was like something a child could design from a fifth grade. Then there was Brenda, the woman who planted Grant and drank in the barn. When help finally arrived, it looked like a giant sign waiting to appear. The design was again not entirely imaginative. Colorful circular balloon with a face in the middle. * Yawning * <br /> <br /> Now about the zombies - the more movies I see with the zombies these days, the more I hope George A. Romero was patented and was the only writer / director allowed to shoot films about them. He's the only person who has done it right so far, except for Edgar Wright and Simon Big (but that was comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were different from the Zombie style. Mr. Romero may have spoiled any zombie film for me because of his vulgar ability to urge his representatives to groan and moan and be ashamed as if the joints had dried up and lacked a drop of synovial fluid, and her muscles resisted the effects caused by the dead shells that began to be properly drafted before moving them back. The followers of "Wheely" did not have the right motivation ... They were horrible zombies. <br /> <br /> So in the end, I give "Slither" 3, for a few laughs and a few laughing gore nice scenes.
