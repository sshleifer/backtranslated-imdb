I was a fan without the trace of the first episode. I really can not express my disappointment at the episode last week. This is a real problem that many American-African families have dealt with and are still dealing with. The lack of critical media coverage was documented in the first 48 hours through a recent study. Law enforcement including local, state and federal are also complicit. What is the purpose of advertising on this topic then coming out on the end? Apparently, the TV can handle almost any subject except racing. This is shameful. Get it together or do not explore it next time.
