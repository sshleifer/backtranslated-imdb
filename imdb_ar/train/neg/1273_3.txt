I have two good things to say about this film: the scene is beautiful, and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what the work was like in terms of dialogue and direction). However, I said, I found this movie very tired. Watching dry paint was more fun. It looked much longer than 97 minutes. From the opening sequence, where everyone talks about each other and Paul Reizer repeats everything he is told on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is filled with cliches and nonsense, not to mention endless bloating incidents by Volck. Also, it seems that the director has difficulty in determining whether the object of laughter or crying. There are some sequences that have been touched, but they all played for laughs. If you are peaceful, passionate, and "nice" you like it, you will love it. But if you're hoping for something more substantial, check out a different film.
