This boring, meaningless, meaningless, non-dumb movie is not the last evidence that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his next films "Trainspotting": "The Beach" has already taken care of it. What this oddity does in the low budget is simply securing its place among those who have started very well but have been completely lost in drugs, alcohol, ego, self-delusion or bad management, or whatever led to the premature death of the promising director. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis is ridiculous: Ecclestone and some probably the rapper Jenna G meet by chance and spontaneously begin to sing with enthusiasm more like crazy asylum seekers than they are the investigators of the duo - who have become. A friend of their friend - the biggest loser Akbar - becomes their manager by smashing a shop window and stealing a video camera depicting them "in action", then showing the tape to some people who are interested in this garbage. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has developed an unreasonable junk, but this is ridiculous. Music makes the Oasis look like the Beatles. During studio recordings, Strumpet changes song lyrics in each experiment, and Ecclestone tells the arrogant men of the music to take it or leave it, and it is absurd that they do it. Not only total music and trash, but their "artists" are anti-social; they are supposed to contact the shot. It's just too stupid. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is unfamiliar and does not go anywhere, and the story of these rags to the bats is meaningless and meaningless. Often feel relieved - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This small piece of garbage is very poor and it is embarrassing to see it. Ecclestone must also be questioned for approval to be part of this nonsense. Those who financed the Â£ 1,000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their underwear on street corners.
