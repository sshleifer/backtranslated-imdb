I watched this movie when I was a young boy full of raging hormones and it was an exciting film as I saw it in my life. It may not be a wonderful movie. My guess is that it is not. I do not remember much about it, to tell you the truth. I remember only sexual chemistry between Crosby and Ben. No woman in any film has done this before for me as Cathy has done incredibly sexy in this film. I have not seen her since the first time I took her on television in the 1970s and I do not think I want to see her again because I'm sure she'll be disappointed - Hormone is not in a hurry I've become more tense over the years. However, when I think back in the shower scene, I still can remember how I felt coming back again. <br /> <br /> Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered it was dangerous to go home again. What was erotic one time now is a beautiful tame. The older thing of the younger women still works for me, not as much as before, probably because I'm not 12 years old anymore. That older woman is now younger than me. Also, amateurs were not seen in my twelve year old mind. <br /> <br /> Ethical: Sometimes it is better not to reconsider the past.
