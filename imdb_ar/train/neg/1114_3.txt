On this day and in the era of stunning cinematic special effects, this was a painful disappointment. The actors seemed cruel and uninspiring, as was the dialogue. Westerners are not a common fare for Hollywood these days, but films such as Silverado prove that someone still knows how to make a good atmosphere. Given that, it's hard to imagine that anyone would go to any account at all in the launch, much less create a weak film like this movie. If you love looking for a good Western, keep searching!
