Wonderful! Why does anyone make a fake film? Half Past Dead was a bad film but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It is only on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The entire movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where there may be a box full of buried golden bricks. In prison, riots broke out between rival prisoners, one of whom was shot by a man named Cortez and Cortez planned to escape. During the marital visit, Twitch's daughter-in-law and the daughter of Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and are being held in a execution room. Burke's friendship reluctantly with Twitch and they end up falling into trouble with idiot prisoners while they discover that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most unnecessary part since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the representation is terrible, and the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a comics. See, I know it is a low budget film, but this is no excuse for these guys not to make an effort at what they do. No one in this "film" believes in the personalities they play. No one in this movie "can be taken seriously as an actor.Corupt must feel ashamed of himself, his character" Twitch "is largely a small, spineless doll spending most of his time pretending to be worn by Burke or other prisoners. His time is smiling throughout the film as if he was forced to get a doctorate (a very huge dump.) The fighting scenes are poorly designed and pathetic, and for the HPD2 Action Movie it's so boring even when an event happens Let anyone tell you that this movie is decent What, he stinks is a major cause of people's disdain for Bollywood.
