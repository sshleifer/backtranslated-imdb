One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, double-film cinematic style television, bad behavior. It is sad to see many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. The bullet Nancy Young can not act. The Terrible Direction. Substandard with bad TV movies. Sometimes weak jokes fall off. Even the basic premise of the film is meaningless. Somehow they are supposed to stop the wedding from happening but there is no logic behind their actions. Making my wife's slow pace stop watching but I suffered through it. Older men are supposed to act as if they were young or old, but it's pathetic rather than funny. How did they get the money up to make this?
