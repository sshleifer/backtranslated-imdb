I went in expecting the film to be completely stupid. With this low expectation, any form of entertainment will be pleasantly surprised. The soundtrack was the best part of the film, but provoking pleasure at this nonsense in the bachelor suites was also fun. <br /> <br /> This, there were many things about The Singles Ward that were quite annoying. The whole movie was called a bad name and hits their mouths while listening to their very disturbing voices. This lack of professionalism has been surpassed only by famous Mormon celebrities who have no business. <br /> <br /> This film will be a good success among Mormonids, especially in college communities where there is an individual section. However, the conclusion will offer no hope to the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the beautiful girls in Singles Ward get married, ugly fats do not get married, but all ugly men get married) In the end, realize that the entire movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
