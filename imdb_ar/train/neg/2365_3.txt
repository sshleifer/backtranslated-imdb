This movie is bad only. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I'm out of this way, I feel better. This film is weak from start to finish. The story is lame. Part 3-D is really bad. Freddy in his worst cartoon character. Praise be to Allaah. They killed him. Who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold embossing? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is the little back story we got at Freddy. We see that he had a family once, and we see his abusive father liquor (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, all this is bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), they do their best, but the end result is very bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this movie is an hour and a half I can not go back to.
