I think the acting career of Michael Ironsides should end if he has to play a leading role in this kind of nonsense. Surely he could do better than wasting his time in this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie may be much better, if it has a good budget, but it shows the movie again and again. There is one scene in a settlement site, it looks like, in front of him in front of a railway station, I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that makes this movie give 3, and shows the spacecraft landing and taking off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This has been done well, but the rest of the film, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, which looks like an engineering factory, I bet on it, and it's not like a space site like the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid and has a very low budget meaningless and God helps Michelle Aeronides.
