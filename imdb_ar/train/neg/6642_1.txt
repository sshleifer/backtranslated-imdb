This film starts with a regular funeral ... and insists on this ordinary funerary feeling that I lost interest during 5 minutes of watching and began skipping the scenes. It seems to me that everyone who makes this film has a degree of falling into a permanent coma, unable to think of anything other than death and destruction. Well, I'm not a dark kid from Southpark. I want a film that makes me find an interesting story within 10 minutes. I will not sit and watch only 10 minutes of preparations for a funeral. My grandmother in her last years was fascinated by funerals and might have enjoyed the movie.
