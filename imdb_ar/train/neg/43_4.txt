The video was initially banned in Britain and was allowed last November without cuts. <br /> <br /> He has a Playboy colleague in October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. Cut the hole back and forth between the pictures of Buchfellner and misty forests. I'm not sure what the purpose is. It was better to focus on the sight of the bathtub. <br /> <br /> Laura (Bushvielner) was kidnapped and detained in the forest for ransom. Peter (Al Claver - The Bund, Zumbi) was sent to find it and ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio Di Capo) can spend time productively, while the last (Werner Boschath) is constantly complaining. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs in the forest. Will Peter save her before eating a cannibal meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this forest. Why do you think it was a bad video! Morrell Montusi was found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - the Angel of Death) on a hijacked boat. Montoss√© is very inconvenient. Peter leaves them and sets off alone to find Laura, who has now been arrested. They spend time having sex, and do not see danger approaching. Courage, anyone? Big fight between Peter and the naked demon (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, beheadings, courage, a lot of front-end full, some great literature of the cannibal priest (Allen Meiss), the line, "They rip her heart", which is fun if you see the movie.
