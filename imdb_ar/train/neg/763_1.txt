I loved Colombo and I saw all the episodes to a great extent, but this stage is undoubtedly the worst episodes. A pile full of mind, meaningless, distorted by an irresistible leadership set, is wasting the audience's time and talent in Peter Falk's very bored film. It seems that the "plot", as it is, looks like an author because the film is in line with and not even the slightest hint of the ingredients of the formula that made this show a great success at first. One part of the actions I found is very puzzling (or perhaps annoying) is the personal presentation of Peter Falk to the guests at the wedding as the "Lt." Colombo. If the producers insist on maintaining the secrecy of Colombo's first name, why could not they completely delete this line because it seems ridiculous? As I said, these pits and all the real Colombo fans will be better avoided like the plague.
