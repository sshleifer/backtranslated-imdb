I need to say - it's stinky! (I gave her an assessment of 2) <br /> <br /> Just watch him if you are insomniac. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of chewing and watching, but nothing else happens in this movie. There is no suspense, no deep secrets are revealed, and there is no real threat to the welfare of the heroine. Some differences, slight lifting votes - this is pretty much. Secrets are not something that can not happen to anyone - another "secret" has been revealed in the movie completely predictable by this stage. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Feith (Meg Tilly), an artist, assigned to paint a series of frescoes in a huge ballroom in a vast palace by a very rich, , And a growing relationship between the mother / daughter an old woman yearns for. <br /> <br /> It turned out that the daughter of the great woman, Cassandra, died. You can fit the rest of the pieces together well. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroism does not go to the point where it really fears its safety beyond a second or two. Why still linger after years of Cassandra's death is a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the fact that in this vast palace there is only one servant, a big, believing servant who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. Everything except the door lock seems to be - because that would be the only explanation of how one of the characters enters a room where Faith is located. <br /> <br /> Nothing will make you cling to the arms of your chair, leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "escalating" tension in this film - just the revelation, the pathetic revelation that comes out from time to time. <br /> <br />
