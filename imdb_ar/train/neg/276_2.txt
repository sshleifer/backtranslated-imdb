The figures are vulgar and predictable, where everyone is either white or completely evil. The representation is so flexible that it is not bad in an amusing way. It is disappointing to double if you are a fan of Bette Davis, because her character is not a typical Bette-Davis character; it's just a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I did not find the film interesting, moving or fun at all.
