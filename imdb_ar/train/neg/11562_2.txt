The wealthy Archaeologist Anthony Stephen (as Alan Cunningham) is a Sadasuchist lover, the British Lord. He brings sexy women with red hair to his castle, where they are flogged and killed. Black shoe stripper Erica Blanc (as Susie) is temporarily out. Mr. Stephen is haunted by the wife of Evelyn, who died during childbirth. As a treatment, he decides to marry again, after meeting a beautiful blonde Malfate (as Gladys). By the end of the film, they will have to dig a few more tombs. "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" is a wonderful title, at least. <br /> <br /> ** La notte che Evelyn usc d dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
