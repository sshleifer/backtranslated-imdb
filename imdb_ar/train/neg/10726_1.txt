I agree with the previous comment, that the beginning of the film is very good, will make you wandering about what will come ....... nothing. All open story lines remain open; two letters that at first seemed to be of some importance are left entirely out of the picture, except for one or two very short scenes. I would walk if it was not better for Leia to leave them completely ... As for the remaining character, nothing would happen with her. She has just visited a fun place, and suddenly the film is no longer around, but about some elderly witches who spend their days making dolls from bread and drinking homemade vodka, and seem to flash each other. Some may say that the film is very successful in showing a collapsing society, like IFFR judges, but to me it's just bad taste, bad camera work, bad script and very bad direction. So I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to degrees: 1!
