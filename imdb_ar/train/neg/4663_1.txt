This movie was just bad bad. I love war movies and I can usually get out of most movies and find something I liked, but this was not one of them. The Finns missed the film to substance and intensity. Well, the Finns have put on one hell of a fight and that's great, but the story is bad. You do not have any real contact with any of the characters and there is no real story line to follow. You just move from one random scene to another, and nothing flows to form the story you are trying to convey. If you want a war movie that will keep you lively, and surprisingly without scenes of battles, I suggest "fall" (German film in World War II). Or if you prefer a great story series and a lot of work, I suggest "Brothers of War" (Korean film / Korean War). These two films will not take you as the winter war does.
