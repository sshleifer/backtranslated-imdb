This joint British-Spanish production is one of the countless films filmed in Spain following the incredible success of the Italian Spaghetti, and as usual in this type of effort, is characterized by a selection of established and emerging films World stars: Robert Shaw, Tali Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Ray, Michael Craig, Lutherry, Dodley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Paradoxically, this film's unruly chaos is a shining example of why most American movie genres became a death line in the 1970s, and it is now a process (or is it officially?) Extinct. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this film, not only because the West is one of my favorite film types, but also because it enjoys all the qualities, including the intriguing hypothesis, to be a good idea - not to mention the fact that my father has Bought a hard copy of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD after its original version! As it is, the only virtue of the film (if it can actually be called) is an eccentric eccentricity: for example, Stevens, plays a widow in order to avenge the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband and sleeps inside a coffin Before his stupid servant Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty dissident, who initially appeared to be the main villain of the film, was sent uncommonly by his religious leader, Litti, very early in the picture; it turned out that the villain of this piece was Landau, Which was seen in the first scene of the film and looted along with our legendary hero who turned into a priest! Fernando Ray, who plays the role of blind farmer, is the only one who can identify the rebel Shaw, which turns out to be just a facade ... Well, what's wrong! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and strange from there! The production team responsible for this film was also behind other Western fare in the same time period as Custer of the WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
