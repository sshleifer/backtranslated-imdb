I'm usually a fan of the bad 80s and the 90s that are now playing pennies ... but this film is so terrible that it was a real test to carry. Men who wear girls' clothes have been to death - but never pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was as tough as usual, and Nicole Egert was no better. This game does not contain any replacement features, so if you are the number one fan of a representative / actress in this trash - stay away!
