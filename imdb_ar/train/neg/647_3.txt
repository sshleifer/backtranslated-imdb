The acting was awful as well as a screenplay. It was poorly placed and made you want to laugh at many horrible murder scenes. The end was worse. Everyone was dying, but the end made him look like everything was just fine! They did not give enough history about the teacher's obsession, etc. The film needed more time to develop a better story. The only reason I gave this 3/10 is that I feel bad for young actors. They needed better training. They could have made this a good film, but the script and the script failed miserably.
