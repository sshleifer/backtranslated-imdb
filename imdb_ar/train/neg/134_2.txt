This film inside was super intelligent. It rhymes a theme with every single horror film ever. Valentine's Day makes ZERO try to be original. What is love anyway? It's a group of people who give each other the same gimmicky messages that were presented to the same people the previous year. There is nothing original on Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, and in this one show here are some of the movies that separated from it. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a pool of silk so he could not grab it as fast as it came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of being a good film. How can each film have a "sudden" killer horror, people who do not care about them because their feelings take their part in every other scene. One minute turns a beautiful girl into a wicked B-ch, then she is an unsafe woman, and so on and her son. <br /> <br /> Usually a horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, again Valentine does not have this. It was as if they tried to make PG-13 but they failed, so they left the amendment. <br /> <br /> You do not see this obsession inspired by excessive, unless you hate yourself and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Lonon Rollins -
