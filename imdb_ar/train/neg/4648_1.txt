This is a bad film by masquerading as an introductory book. The director of pornographic documentaries in the film has almost as much time and screen dialogue as any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary sense" they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that a film is not really an intruder is less of a problem. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film does not contain anything you can see about pornography. It's not so shiny in particular. Although there is a simulated sexual exercise, the amount of nudity is mild for a film that has been classified as R. <br /> <br /> One day, someone will have a good review of the porn industry. That's not it.
