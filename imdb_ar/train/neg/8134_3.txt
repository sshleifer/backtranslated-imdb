A man wakes up from a nightmare about a bat. He and his wife go out into the desert for a walk on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange sound, and is concerned about the sight of bats that creep across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a cave tour, something to do with his work, but she wants to enjoy the honeymoon. They are soft. They go on tour, but leave the group to do it. It falls downhill, where it is disturbed by insects. Follow them. Hearing the strange noise again, he seems to know that the bats are approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights it, attacks it, and hits his forehead. <br /> <br /> They come out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola in a ski resort, their seizures begin. Hallucinations or visions of bats attack people. He gets angry when this happens. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting out. His wife worries about rabies, and Pasteur's treatment begins, but he reacts violently with the injections. <br /> <br /> Then some people are killed. We see parts of the man turning into a striking person. It seems not only in his mind. Whether the bites bite caused these transitions is unclear, because he was already suffering from some of the symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> While the title seems inappropriate, the inclusion in the end is that the same thing happens to someone else. Not a very good movie, but I was impressed with the desert sites, the caves, the ski slopes and some of the strangest scenes. I did not think this was as bad as others and I did not think that Bats 1999 was as bad as others think (I rated it 5/10).
