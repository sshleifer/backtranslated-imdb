The first episode of this new show was today, and it was awful. Not only does Shaggy have a stark new voice making listening to his lines torture, but he is far from the original concept and style of animation that is hardly recognizable as the "Scooby Doo" show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Farid and Filma disappeared and there was a nephew Scobbie Scrabby, the team is still solving the puzzles. Instead, this new show features both Shaggy and Scooby fighting the villainous type of James Bond and his followers while living in a mansion. There is not even a car called Mystery Machine (the next episode promised by a Transformers robot did not work). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make this? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two showcasing the entire Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak the right sounds except Shaggy, and even then I'm generous.
