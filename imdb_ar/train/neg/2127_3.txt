why? Because for one reason, there was no more spectacular scene in any film than Anne Margaret singing "Bye Bye Bird" at the opening. She brings her back in the end, too (in a different mood!). Both are gorgeous. Rent it and see. Even if that's all you see. You're OK, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was very excellent and did not need a reissue, sorry! Both Jason and Vanessa made commendable performances, as did Tyne and Chen. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new release were offering "everything" to them, but it was like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it could not be done! It is annoying to find yourself comparing the mentally ill as you try to appreciate the new version, which is shortened, without the fault of the actors.
