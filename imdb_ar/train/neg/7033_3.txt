The black candles are rather a distorted mess of the same director who brought us "vampires" and much later, "rest in pieces", amongst others .. I just noticed the ones I saw. Anyway, we have a couple who make love, and then somewhere near the pin, they prepare for the voodoo doll then pierce it, and the man cares. I'm not sure if it's good for either, at this point. He moves quickly to the place where the man's sister came to the house to investigate and hear the will, or anything in that sense, and of course everyone else is involved in something that happens in the devil's worship. It is really hard to determine who in moments during the film is a bit confusing at times. To employ things, there is a scene to mimic the Behemoth (I hope it simulates) with a black goat, be sure to be pleased fans. Ugh. Sometimes, this "rosemary baby" is echoed, minus the child, because the host always offers one herbal tea and gains of any kind of bad satanic herbs too, because it continues to get a note. However, the herbs are not the only thing that revolves around this film. It seems that the end is back to the beginning again, and many viewers may find themselves wondering where they were in the middle part. It's not unacceptable, it's not very good, I think it all depends on what you like to see in movies, and there was not much here that did anything very much for me. 3 of 10.
