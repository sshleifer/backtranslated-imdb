I paid one dollar on this DVD, and at first I was annoyed, but then I started to think about it, and I would be grateful. I found the Holy Grail, the true test of bad cinema. If you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium are successfully vanishing with the awkward camera title monologue from Evel, wait for the opening credits to flow onto the driver's backside. The script seems to be pasted together from press clippings and ESL books. But ..... I can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems he has absolutely no connection whatsoever to anything he says, and the only internal monologue I can discover is "Oh my god I bet they think I'm cute ... really cute!". This is Epiphany! I now know how bad it can get.
