just awesome. <br /> <br /> Now, before suffocating a legion of movie fans, let me in detail. As far as I enjoyed it, it's simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's definitely the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Dardevel on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillis and Elisha Kuthbert) were not convinced at best and frankly at worst. Of course, their help was not through a script that had the same emotional depth as the film Daphne & Celeste Singles and the characterization was convincing like OJ's defense. The plot (to extend the term a little) was slender to nonexistent and the scenes were "gore," though obviously brutal, irrelevant and laughable. What revolves around a model of twenty (Cuthbert) is kidnapped and imprisoned and subjected to various visceral, psychological and physical alike. The scenes of torture appear to be separate pieces, and the focus is directly on the shock of the audience rather than on intimidation. While there are very few pros that can be drawn from this film, the recovery features are the disadvantages that make it a terrible film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in the cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and stayed that way all the time. For my part I went out laughing, backed by a movie that went up to the top of the horror film industry. Regardless of the way you look at it, this is really a cinematic and planned achievement for the future directing directors, who carefully detail how not to produce a film. <br /> <br /> P.S. I forgot to mention that I managed to get into the movie for free ... so I could bear his smile. I was still inclined to request my refund ... it was really bad.
