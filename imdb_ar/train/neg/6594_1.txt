I have seen more, if not all, Laurel and Hardy classic films. I've always enjoyed a comedy there stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film tries to recreate the classic with new actors like Laurel and Hardy, but it fails miserably for various reasons. One of them is how clothes are worn in place (still early 20th century) yet both are portrayed in the 1990s. Some previous dialogue has been restored, but it has also failed to approach the classic series. This could be the worst film I have ever seen, and it must be pulled out of the shelf and closed forever. The real laurel and Hardy are definitely spinning in their graves in such a bad tradition.
