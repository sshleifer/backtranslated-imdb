Wow ... what can I say ... First IMDb says that this was in the late sixties ... which meant that Carlito would be very close to going to jail and came out in 75 years and said he stayed for 5 years. They used a group of actors, and a story that did not make sense. They are only one actor, Jozman, playing a completely different man. Why did this Puerto Rican chick end? Where is the storm? He said he loved her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He knew it forever ... you think he was in this place. If this is logical, where is Rocco and the black color in the first? Everything was just stupid ... this is an insult to Pacino's first film.
