I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe and have really sought to get this movie (I had to get a DVD for the Chinese area 5 of it!). But, it really is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Acting (except Dafoe) is terrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote this and directed it (although he is not credited with it as an outlet), and they do not have clear talents for writing or directing. (Committed to the representation of Willem; Jida graduated from work, please!) <br /> <br /> Nothing ever happens. Except for a series of completely unconvincing, completely without a reasonable incentive, the actions of these two persons (which I have just met) in this house. Colagrande sleepy, I could not care less expression changes practically. Sex scenes are frankly lame. I actually tired twice in one of them. YUK! It's certainly not the least exciting, but it's the only time the film does not get you in the loop. After that, he's busy with your bullshit. <br /> <br /> Just awesome.
