Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes on a very strange idea and does not make much effort to get a story out of it. Basically Alice of No. 4 is pregnant and her child is haunted by Freddie giving him an outlet to chase her friends. This has the least number of deaths from the entire series and wise cracks too bad, so no horror lovers or happy comedy lovers. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying much about this. It's impressive to see the characters of Alice and Dan dating back to four, but not worth watching a movie that's over. Unconscious and unattractive, it may be the opposing trend that keeps him from being the worst in the series.
