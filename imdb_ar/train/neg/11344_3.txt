I was not very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is probably worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like animation, very cartoon Saturday morning; it was even worse in some scenes. I liked some characters, Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters, like Cruella, were modest. Cruella was really evil in origin, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was nothing at all to write about the house and her cartoons were ugly. Her boyfriend, Lars, was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seems to have stopped smoking overnight. The vocal talent was very good despite Barry Postwick as a Thunderbolt, except for Judy Benson, but the tone was ruined by me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed swollen to me, and it strongly suggests that there is an extended television episode. All in all, a very disappointing sequel to memorable 60s Disney movies along with the Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give this 3/10, did not have a cup of tea. Bethany Cox
