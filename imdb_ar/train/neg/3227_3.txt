This is premium in the notorious guinea pig series. A short-lived Japanese TV show that was canceled after a mentally ill confessed to inspiring the murder of a young student in the program. This short film in the series, like all other films in the series, practically without any story. A group of young men arrested a woman. They tied her down and began torturing her to death while filming. They beat her, poured boiling oil on her, used pliers on her, and finally, in the vicinity of "Mahbaba", they pushed a needle through her eyes. This is the most obvious of all guinea pig movies, and one of the first. Perhaps this film, more than any other film, was the one that gave Guinea a rumor that it was sniffing. She certainly inspired Nicolas Cage's "8mm" film. These films got very popular in horror circles. I have progressed to more polished films, but equally cartoons like "Naked Blood". It is likely to fill the void left by Mundo films, which have been cleaned up a bit and become a reality TV. Not recommended, but likely to tempt those who will see anything once, wondering why then, I know I did.
