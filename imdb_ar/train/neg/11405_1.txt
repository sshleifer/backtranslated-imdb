I had to watch this at school. Summarize it ... <br /> <br /> Actors who do not know talent, innovative text, and director without talent. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of your time. You do not see the movie. Do not care. You will be very disappointed. My teacher said it was supposed to be good. How wrong. She even slept through it a bit. The film's representatives were only bad. He was the best actor in that old man and this does not say much. It's a terrible plot with horrible characters. Very unrealistic, I can honestly say it is useless. The script was unemotional and confusing. There were points in the film when I hid my browser and said, "What?". There was also a lot of loose relationships and holes plot. It was absolutely awful.
