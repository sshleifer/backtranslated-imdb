I recently watched the film and it looked badly like a book. I blame this on the poor scenario and trend. Some parts were forcibly introduced (scene of gay rape) for no apparent reason. I have read the book after watching the film and about 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and somewhat clumsy. Many different ideas have been presented without interest at all ... unlike time-consuming parts. Because it covers things that are considered "sensitive", at least, during communism, I can see the magic it produced at that time. This is no longer the case, or I may see things differently now or slightly of the two. The film tries to cover many aspects of the book, and the result is a set of scenes that may make sense to someone reading the book. However, this film is difficult to watch and may not have been possible to produce.
