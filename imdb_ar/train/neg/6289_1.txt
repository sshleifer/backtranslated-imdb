This is the most disturbing comedy and the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Every scene worth crawling and the two main actors - Corey and Danny - are very annoying. Corey is very stupid and na√Øve and should never listen to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the Urban Legend killer are the only characters in this poor attempt at the film. Danny (Dean Paras) in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to sleep in - looks like Corey is still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called "Smooth"; there is nothing smooth about this film at all. 1/10 Avoid
