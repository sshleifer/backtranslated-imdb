By Dan Yousef <br /> <br /> A gang of crooks. The perfect plan. All is well. They're in trouble. The police are out. They were trapped. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Sound sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is trying to be a mix of the acting workshop, the film "Indy" and the theater. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of thing that actors like - it's more like a workshop or a play because it often consists of a strong focus on acting actors ... acting with anger, tension, fear, talking, planning, planning - giving performers Lots of free range to give a real touch on everything. <br /> <br /> There are three scammers, one leader, one idiot, and one brother, arriving at a grand scheme of theft. .. Monkey pain was thrown into the business. Most importantly, there is a kind of "barrier bender" and one of the scammers on the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The police are on their tail and stumble in a bar whose name is the poetess (and the main) trying to "Dino's last chance". <br /> <br /> As a director, Spacey tries to focus on actor performances and dialouge. He passes to a bright red cigarette advertisement and a burning Bogart. It keeps all the violence off the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think this was a mistake. Focusing on extreme intensity and violent scenes will give the film some edge. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it moves too slowly and suffers mischief in almost every role. It seems that Matt Dillon ("Cowboy Pharmacy" and "Wild Things") is so small and so perfect that he can not be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> It seems that Gary Senese was thinking and thinking deeply to be an unbreakable sign along with these men and Joe Mantaga is effective because the terrible police lieutenant with the traditional routine dog who is all the thumb, but he did not give anything he does here Oh really. <br /> <br /> William Fisher is the only actor who is credible in his role as a boneless genius and wants only bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Scammers are in a tense position where either they go to jail or try to think of some way out of this. <br /> <br /> Spacey lacks the ability to create and sustain much tension. Characters often talk about chatting, trying to think of a plan ... they calm down and express themselves clearly. There is even a scene where fraudsters play with a whole bunch of armed police outside, ready to be beaten. At one point, even one of the scammers call the police who are outside the bar directly. O'Brother. Whew. <br /> <br /> These police will either blow them away or lock them up. Should not the feared fraudsters be a little afraid, a bit unstable? At the same time, all real actions occur at home. <br /> <br /> Someone has a weapon, a baseball bat, leading to an ugly face off the screen and another victim is speaking ... well, somewhat sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Donnie Fei was supposed to spend more time with the tone coach, which improves her accent in New Orleans. Skeet Ullrich is well in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> The appearance of a policeman who listens to a series of games at the worst of times makes him look beautiful. As well as the scene where someone goes directly through the windshield. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Dialouge is trying to move to the David Mamet approach, which is minimal, but not realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is very similar to what it really looks like ... a really low budget film with a representative behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from the script "Not bad, but it needs more rewrites "He said. Spicy shows that he is not a terrible way out, but lacks the kind of "film-making" sensation that seems to be just acting actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and can work with materials, but they all feel misplaced. As I said before, the film really suffers from abortion. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the wrong actors have been thrown out. I think they found the right actors, but they put them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some roles would have helped tremendously. <br /> <br /> After the veteran mobster Joe Mantagna played the role of group leader, Gary Ceny as an angry police lieutenant abroad on his orders in the Bull gives orders and barks at his troops, keeping Fisher in his "Bloodthirsty Go" part and Matt Dillion as a lame The sacrifice. This was a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors draw, this works. They can even win the Oscars for that. But often, when the actors draw, they have a tendency to focus only on performances. Just shoot the acting actors. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's successful ... but they need a good view of it. Sorry for that. <br /> <br /> The positions of the hostages are all very similar in real life just like the coming stories, so it's normal that the movies move from point A to point B as well. <br /> <br /> There are some really cool entries in this genre. Spicy appeared in a similar film about the hostage cases: The Negotiator. <br /> <br /> This definitely will not become a classic of worship, let alone one of a hundred AFI films. However, it has wonderful moments and personal touches, but in the end, you can instantly forget the type of movie that would play better on normal TV. Not worth it out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Thanks for directing the other Spacey, Beyond the Sea was the best effort. Hmmm ... maybe that's true. It must fail before it succeeds. <br /> <br /> By Danny Yousef
