* The spoilers * <br /> <br /> I'm sure returning when this was released in 1958 was very appropriate for his time. At that time the films were slower tempo to allow the fans to follow up and analyze the story. Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife, who died in mysterious circumstances with his new wife. Mickey's gardener (played by Alex Nicole, who directed his film too) is truly an unappreciated character. He gets a skull to warn Jenny indirectly of being in trouble, because he knew there was a foul game in the first wife's death. He can not tell Jenny directly what happened, so he tries to scare her off the skull. Jenny also discovered that her parents were dying, causing the continuing psychological pain that would lead to institutionalization. Like many fans today, I found that speed was a bit slow for my taste. But if you like the horror of a slow pace without too much trouble, this movie is right for you. <br /> <br />
