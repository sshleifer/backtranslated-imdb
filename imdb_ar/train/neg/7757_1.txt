I have advice for people who made this movie too. If you're going to make a movie like this, make sure you have a backup copy of this movie. Also do not get a group of actors on the z menu to play them out. Another thing, we have all seen the Jurassic Park, so do not copy it blatantly. All in all this film sucked, and / or sucked, acting sucked, a non-original story. Let's talk about acting for only a second, the man Karadin who peaked in 1984 when he "Revenge of the Maniacs" (which was in fact a wonderful comedy). It's not exactly a z-list, it can act. He had to say no to this bag. He had to do what Mark Hamel did after the "return of the Jedi" and go quietly to the night. He made his mark as a "nerd" and it should have been. I understand he has bills to pay, but this barely relieves this bag. Have you contacted this movie yet? Okay. I just wanted to make sure. If it seems a bit hostile, I apologize. I've only wasted two hours of my life and I've been doing something productive like watching paint peel, and I feel cheated. I will close this note. thank you for your time.
