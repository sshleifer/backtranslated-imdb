Since the evening reading was almost as boring as reading, it failed to produce beautifully ... until Meryl Streep intervened and quietly showed to her other crew members how to behave with this kind of thing. Vanessa Redgrave explodes surprisingly in her role because Ann Dead and Claire Danis are the blades. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had changed our roles, we could have seen the small vitality that allowed her to enter a strange world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Anne was already dead. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that Michael Cunningham's addition to the writing credits would calm the storytelling but unfortunately. He gave me a headache.
