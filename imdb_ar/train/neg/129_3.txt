I am really curious in two films - half of which is the sexual experimental aspect of the other and the other half is curious with the political / socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two do not come together. The director must be adhering to the romantic side of Lena and making a separate film for politics. There is a strange mix of political / military gatherings, Dr. King, serious political interviews, abandonment of breasts, and pubic hair. The film looks like a more fanciful documentary film than a movie. Unlike interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored while watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the naked / sexual viewer is overpriced for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better options. Distant nudity is the main distraction from any existing conspiracy. I think the staff did a good job. They played their parts honestly. There are not many ideas I used to see in American films during this time.
