Not very impressed. It is difficult to make any spoilers for this film, because there is almost no development in this plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes, and from there you see the paint dry. The acting looks so bad, reminds me of the old black and white Maoist films that sometimes appear on Chinese television during the day. Although it is difficult to determine the female role, Yuwen, where the story seems to require only her career like a wooden model. It reminds me of the joyful star Gong Li, who has gained fame in some way as a good actress in the West because of a rush on her face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuang Zhuang's "Blue Kate" was a much better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a small town was appointed in the late 1940s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film was made in a time of unrest has nothing to do with the scheme itself, and it seems that the ruins of the city are only a backdrop with breathtaking views. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to capitalize on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and attract a foreign audience who can not tell the difference between a "beautiful" movie "deep" or "hypnotic" and a simply boring and important film. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of "exaggerated", that is it. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
