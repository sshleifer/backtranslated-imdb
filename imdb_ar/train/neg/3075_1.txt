Yeah .. this is definitely there with some of the worst MSTifyed movies, but I definitely saw the worst. Think Gremlins R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some science fiction conferences, and this is amazing, he was lecturing in! It was one of the really low budget agreements, where everything goes, everyone brought something (if you want to see crap, you should see some friends and bring them). <br /> <br /> He looked like a very nice man, he was very wonderful about my questions and my comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> All in all, Rick Sloan knew what he was doing. I think it was supposed to be as bad as the Mars attacks. So I think I stand up with this film and give it a 5 prize, betraying all my MSTies colleagues. sorry guys.
