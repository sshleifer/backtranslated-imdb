I hate this movie! It was nothing like a book, and just thinking about it makes me crazy. If you're watching the movie before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was amazing and this film was not like him. I mean, the general meaning may be similar but most aspects of the film are quite different. End for example! So in the book, it was very intense and Danny Wendy fled seconds before the hotel exploded. But in this terrible version of the film Jack takes them through a stupid maze ... Yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. The other part that angered me is that Jack kills Mr. Haloran! What the heck, is mainly the hero of the book and kill him only because it did not matter. Overall, it was so bad that the film was too out.
