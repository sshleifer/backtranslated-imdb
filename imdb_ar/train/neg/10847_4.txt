The directors' version, which I had seen, was too long for this type of film. Nearly two hours too long. If you have the option, look for the cut-outs. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost never addressed at all, and the film consists of the main part of many murder scenes, which are connected but the feeling is that it is only shown in order to fill the film with hideous violence. The connection was not detected until the last part and the inappropriate context bored me long before my stay. <br /> <br /> A horror film does not work. You will never feel the required character feeling due to the average representation and general disposition (the character is presented and after 15 minutes the character is dead). These strong side images lie in the spray part.
