I believe in the removal of religion from the government and from films. When I want a sermon, I will go to the church, but I do not want one of the film. I do not mind some supernatural subjects, (after all, religion revolves around supernatural as you can!) But this film was so preaching to me that I was really annoyed. The owner reminded me of the witchcraft seen in other films. The bad man looked like horns. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous ending: the hero went to the meeting and shouted at all these elderly men, who broke the spell. If life just that simple. I think when movies are stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: Danger! Get closer to here!
