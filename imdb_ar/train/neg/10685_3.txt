Predictable, stolen and poorly written. Foolishly I reason why such a prominent cast will not participate unless it has merit. I think that the competition between the actors is severe these days (and will get worse) so that one can not choose and choose a lot. Early on we got the ink that was instrumental in the assassination and we had been shocked by our throats ever since. The film lacked conspiracies, giving us a simple idea of ​​the victim and only one motive possible to kill. Some speech was, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone would think of spending tens of millions of dollars, let alone committing to it, to spend this trip.
