Despite his warning correctly, I have already sat to watch this film. Partly because I usually gave each film an equal break and because I think one film can not be so bad. I stand properly. George Kennedy, Barry Postwick or Ben Stein can not save Turkey from drowning like so many bricks. Only once during this humor gave up the irony of parody I laughed. She tells Simon the scene. Other jokes are either poorly implemented or simply unknown. And some of them actually see a mile away. This movie just did not get what it takes to be a good parody like a plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III), or Scary Movie. They have all the funny A. Gags, B. Good dialogue and most of all Jim's quotes are memorable. The guys at White have got none of the above. To call this bad movie would be an understatement. Avoid this movie anyway you can! Consider yourself warned!
