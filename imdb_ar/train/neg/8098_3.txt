This is one of the most horrible re-writing operations I have ever seen. If they want to make a film with a bad story, they should not give it a title for a good book. There is no relationship between Wolff's book and this film other than the title. I do not mind changes if they help story flow on the screen. At least the final product changes should not hurt. The final scene in the film is painfully unconvincing. The actors are miscast. It is clear that the director and / or screenwriter could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing speech. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie and hate it, try the book. If you have watched this movie and liked it, read the book.
