Cage (1989) was another of those low-cost "friends" that were produced during the 1980s thanks largely to movies like 48 hours. And deadly weapons. This is one of the stars of Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno for former Vietnamese Vietnamese who came across a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in Nam. But if he was shot on the head and is now very smooth. Although it is huge, only that Lu has the mind of a child. One day, some teenagers waited in the bar and Lou and Reeb beat them on the tar. But recovery is the mother. Crash bar Le and Le bar with nothing. This is until these two thugs come to the picture (one of them a real nice guy) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Perhaps if they went on their way and did a powerful deciduous work instead of trying to ease the situation, it might have worked. Unfortunately, this did not happen and left the audience holding the bag. Oh, okay. It's very bad because you have all the ingredients for a wonderful B movie. Better luck next time, I guess. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
