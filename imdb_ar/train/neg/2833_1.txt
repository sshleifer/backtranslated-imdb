With Bo Derek, the audience gets what they expect. A thin paper plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek in any dress. "The ghost can not do it" is quite so. The first fifteen minutes is a regular television drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor and has long experience in many different roles, but it seems that even the famous actor needs to work only for money at times. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a handsome young woman in clothes or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Queen, Lawrence hired the Arabs or not Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad behaviors, you can rent any pornographic film.
