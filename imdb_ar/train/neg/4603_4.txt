I was right when I could not see this when I was showing at the Philly Film Festival last year, so when I saw it would be on the cable tonight, I put it in the reminder as soon as I could. So it was worth the wait? Well, let's back off my child because I have not yet plotted you. Sean Crowley is a young man who does not know what his way of life is. He introduced Duke (George Wendt) to his president Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray asked Sean exactly to stop the man Sean was watching around him. And he goes from there. Which leads me to the question. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the crowds were good and George stole and filmed the film for me. I took the ball and ran with it. But it is not as violent anywhere as you could believe it, and somewhere along the length of the movies, not only does the ball fall, but it gets caught in the other direction. I know where exactly this point has occurred, but I can not say without spoiling the film. But needless to say that has happened. The end does not save the film either. Gordon Stewart can not be anything as weak as the "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Carrie and Harer show up in one of the fantasy, They fade and ... oh my god my eyes eyes !!
