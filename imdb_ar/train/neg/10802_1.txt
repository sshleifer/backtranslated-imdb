Let me present a quick summary of the film: a rude, rude child named Max stumbles on a radio that contains Kazam: rapping rap. Like all genes, gives three wishes, but being nice, Max also helps in his personal life, where he has to deal with bullies and a mixed father in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam sings from time to time (also shows razor-sharp skills). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sport. I admit it was not like an Oscar movie, but all about the waste of the film is terrible. The characters are either undesirable or stupid, the plot is not worth mentioning, dialogue is a joke, and the rift is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel played Washington Kazam, this movie will remain a joke. I know that the movie just drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was too big (not pun intended) at the time. I honestly can not think of one positive thing to say about this waste of time. He had to put down the time when he used to make this movie into free throws.
