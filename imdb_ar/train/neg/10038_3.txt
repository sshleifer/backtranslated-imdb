The film lacks style, means the original style. Everything seems copied, including motion, first appearance in the movie, songs, delivery of dialogue, etc. Yes, there were original coordinates, as in the beginning a car is displayed with UP **** and after a few seconds it starts falling on a hill with MH number ****. That was one among the many villains in the movie :) Was there anything good in the film? Yes, for Kareena fans, if any, Kareena in Bikini. For Akshay fans, his conversations and his exciting works. This is. nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and do not blame the manager or the actors. Director already crazy and actors, I pity them.
