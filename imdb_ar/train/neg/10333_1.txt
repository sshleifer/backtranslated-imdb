What was a rather exciting and innovative series by Fox had degenerated into a tortuous intestine. During the first season, Dark Angel was on the "I Must See" list weekly, not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers that ended up in Fox decided they needed to "fine-tune" the scheme. During 3 episodes of the opening game of the season, I was completely lost as a viewer (not even to watch Jessica Alba!). I found new characters that were added in the second season to be very silly and amateur. The new lines extended supply continuity and reliability. In one episode of the second season, they had Max sleep and dream - the first season showed that she could not sleep biologically. <br /> <br /> Morality of the story (the story never got Hollywood): If it works, do not prove it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
