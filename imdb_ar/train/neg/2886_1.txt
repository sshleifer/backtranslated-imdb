Awesome, awesome, awesome Do not waste your money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget made for a Canadian TV movie. Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen and there were plenty of other movies. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in a DVD or VCR player. I saw the film on the BTK killer and it was much better (compared to this one) .I'm not sure what they were looking for In the production of this film, but if the goal is to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer, it has lost one mile and seems to have been more than animal rights rights.
