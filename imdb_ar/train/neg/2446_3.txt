Rajkumar Santoshi produced without a doubt the biggest movies and biggest nets of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This film does not live up to expectations as this movie is two stars, great actors Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. When do you have these two actors in the same movie, you have to make Magnum Opus. <br /> <br /> In the final part of the film, you can take Amitabh Bachchan's voice out of someone else who is due to his illness. <br /> <br /> Still, the film did not have a proper evolution of character, and filming was not very good. One of the things Bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when needed and when they should be applied. With a high budget. The script had a lot of drawbacks that give the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The newcomer shakes his leg well but he could not act well but where the film loses a great time is a cinematic story scenario. <br /> <br /> A talented actor such as Baumika Chawla was shot in the film as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every exit once in his career makes a bad film. <br /> <br /> So watch it only if you're a fan of Flow-Starrer Flop.
