Imitating his long title, the film finds ways to approach the 90's. The beautiful collections here with everything that make Hamer production values ​​a brand, yet the sinking of Paris in the mist is a sign of slow neglect. The story is clear and can be summed up by dozens of words, so there is nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention is expected. <br /> <br /> The guidance is heavy like the direct transfer of a play, actors are mostly solid as wax forms (well, this is a feature of Hamer, but sometimes it is better in the whole group). My conclusion: this movie is garbage, not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring question and I should have hoped that those responsible for programming in film cinema would know.
