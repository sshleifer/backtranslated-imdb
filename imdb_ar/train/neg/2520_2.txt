Well, this film had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the film he just went through a terrible war, but they have money to buy huge robots and fight them against each other. Each state decides instead of investing in rebuilding its own country that they prefer fighting with robots that no one can afford. Here's a better idea, let's rely on our inefficient resources, the cylinder players, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director, and what about him. He is making a good film, making a bad film. There is no reason to give this film some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? I totally enjoyed this film, because it was very funny and ridiculous and I had to laugh. I have had a good time watching it, except for the teacher of the cowboy teacher who turned out to be a murderer (trust me no one will see this man fatal, so it's a surprise, no matter how lame) Jim is the jungle anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k did not do this. However, I give a two-star rating because nothing can be as bad as "self-manos hands". <br /> <br /> No matter the budget too, I've seen lots of reasonable movies that do not include anything for budgets like the cube. The story was not even reasonable and I saw the best acting in school plays. Sure, they could carry an 11-year-old boy from any middle school play. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can watch it, it's a fun movie to watch.
