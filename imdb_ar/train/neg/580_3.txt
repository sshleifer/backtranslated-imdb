The film is really bad, the story is very simple and predictable and misconduct as a supplement. <br /> <br /> The story of this vampire hunter is the worst I have ever seen, Derek Bliss (John Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico in search of some vampires! , He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), part of the network of vampire hunters in Van Helsig? Well, he works alone. Was commissioned to seek a powerful vampire queen looking for some black crosses to perform a ritual that would enable her to be exposed to the sun (almost a sequel to the vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and director James Woods), Derek began his quest for the Queen with some new friends : Sancho (Diego Luna, also acting badly) An inexperienced teenager, Father Rodrigo (Christian de la Fuente) Catholic priest, Zoe (Natasha Wagner) Vampire and Ray Collins (Darius Mottifal) Another expert Vampire Hunter. It is clear in this adventure that it is not lonely. <br /> <br /> You can begin to feel how this film will look like its main actor (John Bon Jovi); it is a big difference in the quality of acting compared to James Woods, so if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part) Participate in one of the most basic stories, which are quite predictable, with horrible representations, very special special effects and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not watching this movie! , Rent another movie, watch another channel, or go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 10/3
