Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who are eager to trample this film in the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel this way. In fact, if it had been advertised as a zombie movie or similar, you might have enjoyed it. But now, I am completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Though I'm not sure what to spoil * Let's start with the first drawback. If I did not know that the film was called "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and I did not see some sequences where some people seemed to be sucking blood, I did not see contact with Vampires. I mean, without a price ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> The second bad point: What is with the metal? It seems that all young people, but basically those who are called "vampires", are in different kinds of minerals, and are judged mainly by their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've been into the most extreme form of music for almost 15 years, but no one will scare me by showing some ironic teenagers in Iron Maiden (from all teams !!!) T-shirts running, pretending to be vampires! "Pity" is the only word I can use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: actors. Wait a minute. What actors ?! You mean friends wooden director! Words will be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, well, the movie is very cool, but what difference does it make? It was a strong point and something to enjoy if the "wonderful" director did not choose to create the subject of artificial vampires in this film. I wanted to see the vampires, but I was treated to some stupid children who loved to use a baseball bat. The filmmakers should have announced the movie, "The cheap horror of Class B without any plot, but there is a lot of injustice" !!! <br /> <br /> This film is blasphemous against the entire concept of vampires. This makes me sick.
