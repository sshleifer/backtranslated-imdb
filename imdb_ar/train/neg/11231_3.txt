I like independent films with low budgets and I have high hopes in this film. But this movie is fixed. You do not care about the value of production, which is very noble for its budget, but the speed is deadly. It is recognized that these people do a lot with little, but the film fails at the basic level. it's boring. The editing is icy and speed kiosks. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who has not seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to suffer through the Baltimorean-Brits stampede through a never-ending exhibition. It looks like a video-backed actuary. <br /> <br /> The noble efforts made by everyone in production, but the story of this fatigue was needed to kick in the pants and was supposed to provide her new low-budget non-traditional sound technology. Instead just a lame renewal.
