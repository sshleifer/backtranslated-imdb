I was honest to me Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the entire movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the film was about. After much debate, we all agreed that this was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> It does not hold well. It's very volatile, and there is little comedy. I am disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to watch this movie based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are complete and just want to watch all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
