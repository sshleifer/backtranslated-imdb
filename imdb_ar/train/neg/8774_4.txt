Story: The four-hour film details the events in the Cargill sector near LOC in 1999 when Pakistani hackers crossed LOC and entered Indian territory and Indian revenge. To learn more about the story, I suggest readers read the news related to Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If someone is looking for a formula story in this movie, one can make sure it is absent. LOC is the story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and plenty of lead and blood. The movie theater where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the film "Indian Courage" was shown. The audience seemed like the Indian cricket match and the Pac-Pac. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the sacrifices of the army and to describe war heroes in real life (4 honored heroes of PVC) who sacrificed their lives so that we can see this day. The film filmed a great army that fought all odds in difficult weather conditions. The movie's negatives are that it is very stretched and the songs are very boring.
