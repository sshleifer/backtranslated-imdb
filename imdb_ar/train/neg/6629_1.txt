If you saw Shulaie in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen Sholay in 1975, go to him. But do not watch this movie. This movie contains all the components that may have made a mistake in making a new version of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of psychic villain for the better (perhaps only forty minutes from the pulley that should not burn). If you remove the rest of the movie and watch only Amitabh play around it, it will still be worth watching. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan is very worldly and the only reason I think they played Brashant Raj in Raj's role is that he is remarkably like Amitabh in his youth. Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up. But the "Worst Performance and No Role So Far" award should go to Nisha Kothari. She has been able to degrade her acting ability so much that high school drama would outperform her. <br /> <br /> If you have a human enemy, take it to this movie. :)
