I wandered into this film after watching the 82-minute film "Borat" and was very disappointed. I was a great admirer of Wallace and Gromit, and I usually go to watch animated movies. However, I found myself nodding and out of a point, but I remained waiting for this film to improve. never happened. <br /> <br /> Stunning images and vocal work are first class, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself several times that the evil villain with the evil top head was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this film for me is that it is one of those animated features of the ADD group. After the truth as a routine procedure one by one, is burdened with a plot full of torment that pulls each station in an attempt to deliver an "important message." It looks like a catchy Oscar for the moving class, and given the way I've scored with the critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy made a mistake in providing its equipment. But if you are looking for a fun cartoon feature around mice, get my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
