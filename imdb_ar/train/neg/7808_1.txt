I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen. Needless to say, I bought this movie without even renting it or anything else ... This movie was so terrible, I did not prepare it to the store, and I do not want anyone to be exposed to this human poison, In the trash, I do not care about the money, it was worth the price to be able to get rid of it. It was not so bad, it was not good or anything. The story was terrible, and the end was something I despised. He was a broken man, addicted to alcohol. His life was a bunch of garbage. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible way to show his innocence in his childhood, and the dog was much better. I also hate religion, so this end certainly angered me. Jesus Heals Everyone ... I hate that I know that people like them like Christians and Catholics are in a rush and will show the time that God does not heal everything, or anything. It was a terrible film, if you had the option to see, pass it, buy it better, rent it, throw it in the trash, and leave it in the morning.
