The 1963 version of "The Haunting" was one of my favorite horror films for years, so I was expecting a new edition of 1999 with a great deal of fear. It hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or equal the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my fears were firm: this film is spreading. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people in this film are thinking. Jan de Punt, who seemed to have a good fortune when he brought out the excellent "speed", was doing badly here (or perhaps worse) as he did with many "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control" tunes. "Jean, and sticking to the film, is he?" Liam Nison is enough in his role as a psychologist pretending to be a sleeping doctor - I do not think he can perform really bad - but he can not even keep a lame text and a weak story. (As she did in the "trap") she lacks the ability to act over the material that is delivered to her.The female who has been very successful in a ring of "X files", lost here like Eleanor, is thinner hovering on the edge of the mind. , Whatever it is, is more coarse than the funny alien sculptures of children carved into the woodwork around the house For a single expression throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> The reason for the success of the first film is that we were never sure whether the house was truly inhabited or whether the appearances Is the result of Elinor's fragile mental state: there are no souls in the original, leaving much imagination - the hallmark of other great horror films such as "The Changeling" and "The Witch Project." In this updated version, (CGI), which makes the movie (in the face of the script / weak scheme) make the film quite unfeasible. f / x is not so big, given that it has been done by ILM. Frozen breathing seems particularly counterfeit. The effects in Peter Jackson's "The Frighteners" movie, which I saw before this film, were much better. Wooden carvings for children, which are supposed to look creepy, just look silly (especially when screaming), the CGI monsters are not writing about the house. Instead of providing relief from bad representation, bad direction and bad writing, the effects add only to this mess of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the more idiotic scenes: when the other three characters storm into Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seem surprised at all by finding a huge demon walking over the bed. Scene where "you see" Eleanor the former lady in the house hanging from the rafters ... The representation here is very bad. And last but not least, the unintentional funny thing in which the "blond wooden man" chants an unconscious cry for what is supposed to be painful, jumps over a piece of furniture, and begins to cut off the old painting of the evil man who built the house. We actually got some satisfaction in this scene, and seconds after his attack, Blond Guy was dragged to the fireplace by the ghost of the old man and was soon beheaded by the chimneys. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> In short, stick to the original 1963 "The Haunting". 3/10 Stars.
