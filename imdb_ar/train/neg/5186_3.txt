RKS movies have always been commercial films for the 1990s, from GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His last few films KHAKEE were fun for the family was crap <br /> <br /> This film is decent but can be better < <br /> <br /> The character of Ajay Devgan appears very well but his character becomes heroic and can be hidden < <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, The message was not displayed well <br /> <br /> A decent RKS direction, although it might be better to have the music ok <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks good and easy to play mostly though From that sometimes it does not feel comfortable in the light scenes, it excels in the dramas Vidia excels in the scene in front of the media. T excel in his part Darshan Garriwala screams as the old villain and the rest is fine
