I agree with all of his predecessors and they said anything that would convince you not to waste even short moments watching this amateur film amazingly. Very poor, undeveloped production values, totally pedestrian orientation, inefficient and rude text, should not be written, let alone produced. It seems that the "pros" in Hollywood are going to work just to get paid, although no one should be paid for this bad work. The professions should instead end up on this unimportant leadership group. <br /> <br /> OTH, there's something wonderful about watching something very bad. Chad Lowe is very bad and steady.
