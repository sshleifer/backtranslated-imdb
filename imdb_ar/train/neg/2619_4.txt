It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It goes very slowly early but ends if a wave of de Ville erupts. The basic plot is the same as the first film. The bright side of the film for adults is the modern bird that is believed to be a dog. The bird speaks like a human being (Eric Eidel of Monte Python) and barks like a dog. It's the comedy that the film needs more. You can watch it in the apprentice so you do not have to pay the full price or wait until it shows up on Disney.
