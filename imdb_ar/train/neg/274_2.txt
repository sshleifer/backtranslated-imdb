There seems to be little in the middle of Watch on the Rhine. Either one loves him very much, praises his sincerity, liberal outlook and good behavior, or hates clear publicity, mediocre dialogue, cardboard figures and public inclination. I fall a lot in the last category, and I found the film and play, regarding the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - an overwhelming cavity, most of which deserves representation, even sporadically. This author Lillian Hellman on the side of the angels was irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, rarely exploring ideas that did not exist by the author and the audience except to mention the extent of the "other side" appalling. So when I find myself in a hundred percent deal with what you say, as in the Rhine - I still can not stand up as you say. Her characters are not genuine, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain way of how people speak, they have no real brilliance or originality. It really has nothing new to say. I fully agree with the late dismantling of the late Mary McCarthy to dismantle Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who believe that the theater has died or is in the extreme of longing and longs for the old days, I urge a glance at the "Witness on the Rhine", which is bad in its way like "Angels in America", which only shows that the theater had feet One in the tomb sixty years ago.
