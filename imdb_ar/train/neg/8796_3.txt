Ordinary viewers looking for a sense of coherence in a movie are likely to give this success. It generates the same feeling as staring at a strange group of individual images that seem to have something to do with each other, but never assemble in their entirety. <br /> <br /> While this isolated approach to creating a kind of film montage may attract a few students or critics who are steeped in the inner language of contemporary filmmaking, it is very disturbing and gives us up to the public who have just fallen out of straw. Evident evasion of accessibility may be the deliberate feature of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it appears when Andy Warhol rushed. The only redeeming attribute I find is the values ​​of production, and these values ​​here will not cut everything by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those products that you see and listen to and wait anxiously and in vain for some intelligent development of an idea or idea to keep all the wonderful and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Line balances start unexpectedly as interest begins. I get the same big yawning and ambiguity in reading what I think are fully informed and comprehensive comments about this film that never lead to anything that can really be understood. Thoughts and images that do not contain any external context are not my idea of ​​pleasure. <br /> <br /> An artist walks me through the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of a piece of candy. <br /> <br />
