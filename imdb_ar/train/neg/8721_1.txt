I'm sorry but that's just pathetic. She was a little girl, and there were no funny characters, and the plot was committed. In addition it was not even gator as the film wanted us to believe. If you examine any complete reptile guide, you will find that it is actually a crocodile and not a fist. Obviously they did not hire a real animal expert or they knew that the creature was a crocodile. It is a sad excuse for a film. Especially the end. I almost slept with this.
