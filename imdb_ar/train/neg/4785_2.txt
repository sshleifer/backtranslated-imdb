There is a big mistake in this wet, thin picture of a film that is hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a very scary film and not scary, even by Amercian standards. Dialogue cliches, two-dimensional characters, writing is home-humm, and the small story there is neither coherent nor interesting remotely. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Guy (probably absolute, but who knows? This film does not tell us) with a brave heart, little hero (who does nothing heroic at all), Brive Little Kid (with a series of miles stretching murders) Black bad ass bitch (with more brown brains). These guys are in constant battle with Tall Scary Reaper Man and the evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, the film is full of evil metal heavenly bodies that are threatening people. If given the opportunity, they perform improvised brain surgeries for those who do not have the mental dexterity of a duck when they come to them. Poh! In fact, someone is chasing a good ghost (but again, he may be a deceptive ghost) who seems determined to help our brave adversaries recover their kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> There is no personal background or even introduction to any of the characters. It starts with a sort of conclusion from the end of the previous film, but that does not explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, that's fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are connected, why they do not go to school or work, or why they should care about whether they are living or dying. Thus, you do not do it. The only point of interest becomes any spray effects. There are not enough of them to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Among the strong interests / entertainment, there are three of the Bonkers rider, they are stupid like evil, who threaten our heroes. But they do not get much screen time. It is stopped almost immediately. Then they are buried (why should anyone take time out of my will), then they show up again as a rider's zombie rider. You will not be disturbed again, literally within one minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film seems to consist primarily of the appearance of Caspar the Friendly Ghost and disappearing, driving around in search of places, and Balding Loser trying to score Bad Black Bitch Booty, using catch lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. Do not dice there. Not even some unexplained sex could have saved this movie, so the good thing is that there is absolutely nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The president, Tall Man, is unable to intimidate anyone over 3 years old; howl "Blackjack!" Every five minutes is not enough. Why is it, with its amazing telekinetic abilities and miraculous power in the upper body, does not simply explain our heroes like mistakes. Instead, he assigns the job to his young incompetent subordinates, who have never been able to kill anyone before being shot in hell. <br /> <br /> Filmgoers who like masterpieces such as "Friday 13 XXXXVIII part: Jason goes to college" find some entertainment. The rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will feel bored of our skulls.
