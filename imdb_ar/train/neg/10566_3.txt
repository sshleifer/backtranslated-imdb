While I consider myself a fan of the television series Babylon 5, the original film that made the series a weak start. Although many of the elements that will mature later and become more convincing in this series exist, the pace of Gathering is slow and the makeup is somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing. Worse, the description in the first supply loop is weak. Although the ratings scheme shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember that The Gathering almost turned me off, quickly turning into an amazing series.
