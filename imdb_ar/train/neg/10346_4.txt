You think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter, this was a much better film. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the difficulty of believing characters as well as a big problem in the plot that makes some characters seem addicted to the mind. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Ingrid Bergmann's arrival in the Stoudard family. Everything is very peachy and bloated - the family adores Bergman and things can not be more perfect. Well, until the death of the mother (Fei and Ray), the stock market crashed in 1907 (spent on the family fortune) and Bergman was forced to return home to France. This part of the film is a bit sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the fortunes of the family improved, Bergman returned. All four boys are now raised and there is no conceivable reason to hire them again as a teacher. But, briefly, everything swells up again. But when World War I happened, the four went to war - my God! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings his new wife (Susan Hayward) home. Miss Hayward's character is black and white like others, although she's all good and swollen, she's obviously diabolical and satanic. To make matters worse, she comes into the family home while David is at war. <br /> <br /> Now here is where the film becomes really stupid - stupid in the brain. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers, but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends to be, not Hayward with Jack! why?! Why would any sane person do this to save a wicked woman's butt and obviously contribute? This was exactly the sort of excuse that Bergman needed to get rid of the sniper gutter once and for all! This is just a case of lousy writing and made me crazy ... and probably did the same for the fans again in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film consists of a failed opportunity after Hayward's evil chance of being exposed. This only fly against common sense and make the film a silly melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth finally appears, and everyone swells up again - happy to be a great loving wonderful family minus Slut, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from bad writing. Hayward's relationship was not in any sense - at least in how it was handled. The presence of very good or evil characters (with nothing in between) drowns the film into second-class soap. The only thing he keeps at all is acting --- they tried as best they could using a written text. Suffice it to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this movie had to applaud a dead chicken!
