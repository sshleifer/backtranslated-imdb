An ironic horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) dies and leaves everything to his four sons, and his servants are equally divided. One condition - they should spend one week at his ranch to get the money. If someone dies, others will get more. Guess what happens next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new version of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looked beautiful. It's all the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let us recall some of the problems that this film faces: The killer is blatantly clear; the services are called Igor and Elga - Come on! Some of the sound recordings were too bad and I could not make the dialogue (I'm not sure); the bull was very spooky and bad; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and the film contains some really hateful actions - On-screen disbelief. Even pro Geoff Morrow was terrible! The only good work was a bit of a hassle by Feth Domerjo (who deserves better than this) and John Carradine (who looks old and painfully here). I have to admit though - the final line in this gem movie! <br /> <br /> Why has "Legacy of Blood" been renamed - another horror movie of 1978 with that name! Whatever his name, it's a bad film. Must be avoided at all costs.
