Before I begin, let me say that my experience in this film may have been influenced by the dubbing, which I have gathered from other comments that were the original experience that some have considered inferior. Therefore, it is quite possible that a new translation or DVD version will make a difference. I also did not read the opposite book; I'm just familiar with another Japanese manga and I miss the cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential future spoilers in the future. <br /> <br /> I often like science fiction stories with ambiguous degrees (like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I never enjoyed this movie at all. Although it began to be moderately intriguing, it only became boring at a time when it was halfway. There are all sorts of problems. Let us start with what might be more severe: dialogue. Characters do not seem to be able to formulate whole sentences; if they do not shout each other's names for the tenth time, they usually ask for a single section ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters completely backward and two-dimensional. It does not help at least that many of them only get a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that it will develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the images. <br /> <br /> Snoring is backed up by some pseudo-philosophical techniques that seem mysterious and unambiguous even by Star Trek. There is nothing deep and purposeful here - everything seems random, randomly thrown out of different parts of the scientific ideas about stocks without coherence at all. <br /> <br /> What little conspicuous plot is nothing more than an excuse to start the long final sequence consisting of scenes of chaos and destruction. There is nothing wrong with a little chaos and destruction, of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking, "What's the use of it all, and how long it ends." The evolution of character is made in the last 30 minutes or so of little more than turning Tetsuo into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason easily. <br /> <br /> The end of the picture is similar in 2001 - a strange series of images that, far from solving anything or explaining it, let the viewer feel that he was only looking at a two-hour scene. I'm sure some will claim that this kind of stuff is an art; but for me it was just a lot of innovative use of color and shapes. (Some music was also very interesting). Unfortunately, all these things do not contain any materials. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies that intelligently deal with "mature" themes? It saddens me to say that you are likely to find this kind of thing at South Park.
