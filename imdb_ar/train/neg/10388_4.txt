From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to be floundering a lot, but I did not think it was bad. I have seen what is much worse, in fact. <br /> <br /> "House where evil dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, moving to the old house in Japan. Little known, the Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years ago with the samurai sword. With strange things happening at home, the ghosts of the former population begin to own the carcasses of the neighborhoods and plan to re-establish the bloody killing that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was vulgar, but I saw worse in my day. The ghost sequences were slightly violated, and we saw the translucent transparent blue forms randomly emerging around the family and taking over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this kind of ghost movies reminded me of a haunted trip at Disneyland. I may be wrong, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and a new American edition of that film have separated from this little. The old Japanese house in which a brutal murder, ghostly activity, swearing at home and so on. But I may be wrong. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is a beautiful ghost story. Do not go far by seeing, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens on TV, you can offer it. 10/04.
