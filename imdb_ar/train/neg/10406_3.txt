Warning: This review contains small spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the first book of tremors has officially become out of mind. I am a fan of the first film and the first two very good video rental series. Shakes 4: Legends begin, however, is a very boring film. Where is heck is a gerboid ??? <br /> <br /> Given the relative lack of Graboids during the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series is supposed to be a "study of the characters". Unfortunately, there is no one interesting person in the film, except the character Billy Drago which is given very few lines, does not do much, and in the end there is only a very short time on the screen. What saved the second and third films was the presence of Michael Gross as Bert Gomer. When there is no action on the screen, you can rest assured that Burt Gummer will be fun to listen and / or watch. But in this film, Gross Hiram Gomer is a bad and boring alternative. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, when Graboids are on the screen, they look good, but that's as good as it sounds. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was included in 101 minutes. Very good to directly to the video. But after watching it, I'm sure this movie takes 15 minutes. There are long periods of boring dialogue and no more conspiracy. Was there a rush to get this film made? I do not think so, it was possible to spend more time in the script, and I was supposed to spend. <br /> <br /> I thought I had got a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 on sale with .... Tremors !!! What luck you think, and pay for # 4 get 1 number for free. After watching the Tremors 4 well, I think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, and I can not imagine paying once for the Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it's better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists. <br /> <br /> Shakes 4: Legend begins with 3 out of 10.
