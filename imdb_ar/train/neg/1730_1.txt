First, I would like to point out that I only know the offer because my younger sister always sees it. I find it the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about any of the "jokes" and unbearable canned laughter. The show will work better if it's shot in front of a live audience. In this way, laughter will show the extent of "strangeness" in the presentation. However I am credited with the acting talents of young cast. However, it makes me think they will look back at the program in the future and see how bad their first television program was. The exhibition is well connected with the overall disturbing sounds and style of CBBC sponsors. Why today's youth need to shout at so much is beyond my control. That's it.
