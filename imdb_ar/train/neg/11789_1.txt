Actually had to stop it. Do not get me wrong, I love bad monster movies. But this was very boring, regardless of the suspicious music that does not lead you anywhere. The actress had a lot of teeth and that moment when she came into contact with one of the monsters, was completely vulgar. This movie completely defies the cover on DVD that looks very fun. From the casing, one expects a giant beast, but you will get these nice snakes and not as massive as expected. I moved to watch another movie called The Killer Rats but this is another review. Deep Shock was really nonsense, which is a great shame given the fact that it looks very high budget.
