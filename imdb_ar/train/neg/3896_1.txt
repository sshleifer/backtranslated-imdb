Okay. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, hanging "did not even live to see the sun through the rings of Saturn," while the apparent sunlight flows through the window in the middle of the day when he suddenly has a nosebleed. The West then returned to his home in a secret hospital, a gelatinous melting block causing a frenzy and causing an overcrowded nurse to pass through a fake glass door. Apparently, the West "grows stronger when it melts," which makes the sense as much as anything in this talented film that is calm and desperate. This Dupe, "the brass army," which is somewhat like Coleman Francis (director of many bad movies), tries to cover the information, but a Go man runs and kills everyone he sees because he melts. The old couple attacks the bickering because it melts. Makes one awful actress and moans helplessly for 10 minutes as it melts. It melts because it melts. Forex is supposed to be by Rick Baker, the star here, but they seem to be intertwined. The film was badly filmed and everything seemed so dark and confusing that it was very difficult to define what - and would not help. Says MooCow who cut the cheese with this one? : = 8P ps - "Did not you get any crackers?"
