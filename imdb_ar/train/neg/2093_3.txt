If you like syfi soap opera, this offer is right for you, since the fare I do not work for me, after watching 3 episodes, I can not see them anymore. It's boring and slow and to show that the schedule is around 100,000 years ago if you put it on a schedule to fight galactica to get to the ground, it sure seems to have all the same things as old 100,000-year-old Chevy cars and people watching LCD TVs The famous brand is 100,000 years old. The same applies to the rest of the groups also in the show. There are a lot of things that are included in this day so as not to overlook them, and I think they could have done much better work to overcome these problems and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same problems but not the same Bad. As the fare is like the rest of the show it's not nearly as good as BSG and it's a bad sequel before it ?.
