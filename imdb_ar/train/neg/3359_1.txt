Bored this story! In the end, Neil is considered heroic and prepares for the team to save all their donkeys from Hill House and a bunch of such nonsense! They added broken heads, wires that cut the faces of the people, and turned the ceiling into a giant hand! What the hell is this ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and love it! The reason that the original film and book are so wonderful because it frightens you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no Gore. There is no hand roof. It is only the secret declaration of how ghosts can really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us around the room or fly with a knife in our heads. No, they can only drive us crazy. Take away all our senses for security. Neal was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, they were a bit attentive to others, but not so much. David Silve and Jean de Punt took a crap about this great story! I hate this damn remake!
