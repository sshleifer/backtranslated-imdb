Dolph Lundgren embraces and makes his way through this unbridled puzzle / excitement that does not amount to the Fund's ratification. It's actually very good here, but the story is a mess of clich√©s (B) (investigators, vengeance, emperors, prostitutes, S & M) that seem to be formed as they progress. The film picks up a little in the second half but for a decent Lundgren click, RED SCORPION is hired instead.
