I'm not one of those people who surf the Internet after seeing a movie and deciding it's the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please take a look at the other reviews. However, for the first time ever, I saw a film so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it ended. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I think bloody murder, Gibbs reptiles and most terrible horror movies were good. However, there is one good thing I can say about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically nonexistent. If someone who reads my review misses his money to see it, they can distinguish what the plot might be for themselves, but I advise you that nickel deserves more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The representation is bad. <br /> <br /> Both of them are attractive, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I invite anyone to e-mail me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion in this film before it's too late. I will tell you anything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, I love horror, and I love new, innovative films. I love porn horror things like Hostel (which some reviewers claimed that this was like, but obviously they just think why Roger Barth was in this and Hostel 2). But this may be the number 1 most valuable and stupid and obsessed by EVER. <br /> <br /> Before you ignore this review, this comes from someone who did not just sit during the first show of ENTIRE from House of the Dead, but actually bought a copy of it.
