But there are not many of them. Probably the worst "big release" movie I have ever seen. Definitely the worst this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, acting or acting. The problem goes beyond all that. It puts absolute stupidity of the annoying (and not funny) kind of thing that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. Maybe, because of Stephen Martini. I have really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes Wash the toilet along with a few brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
