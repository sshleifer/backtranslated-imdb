Is this a worse episode than Star Trek? Maybe, at least I get my vote on it at the bottom 5. I mean, this episode is meaningless at all. Do you see something that makes you feel crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different appearance, the music is getting stronger, and it almost forces the feeling of distress to the point that it absorbs. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion or anything other than Medusin, these very boring strangers to make a ring around them. McCoy gets to pronounce the famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock puts goggles when the ambassador moves away but Kirk does not. They are now fighting the deadly "barrier" for the third time I can remember, and it is boring. The next episodes of the third season will be "Specter Of The Gun", "Day of The Dove" and other trackers, making Trek a good show to watch at the same time as people like me will rally like enthusiastic fans. Personal notes, Trek likes to use purple, a kind of purple purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the cabin, the corridor that is gray now has a purple color. We never had a purple bridge but it was interesting to see it, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and works very well but in this loop, the lanes are very lame.
