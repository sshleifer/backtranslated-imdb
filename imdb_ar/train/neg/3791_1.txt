I can not vote on this because I will not see trash from these people. They got my money with another film (Mr. Jingles) and swore it would not happen again. I feel it is my civic duty to help people get away from this garbage. Go to the forums in this movie and read where members of the acting team are trying to act as they are watching the movie for the first time. One person even responds to himself ... using the same name! There Shils at the forum says it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... not close (by any means). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first. This means that the third film should be much better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how to distribute these trash using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is good ... but do not try to market this trash!
