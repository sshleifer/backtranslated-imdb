"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are undesirable personalities. This is not the problem. They are undesirable and we do not care about them at all. The "War of Roses" included unpopular characters, but because of their proper introductions, at least we found ourselves interested in their fate, while in the lead "Envy" is slim, the characters are never believable, and the plot makes things worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply disgusting in his role and I love his work most of the time. Stiller uploaded this direct version of the video and now I can see why. The film suggests it's "best friends" with Jack Black, but since the first five minutes we've got footage that seems to indicate that Stiller hates Black. I thought that this would evolve into a one-sided relationship ("The Cable Guy") but never developed. Instead, Stellar insisted that he was "his best friend" and felt confused because he looked like a black treat, as well as "feces." The film plot is silly but it does not matter, because it is supposed to be an exaggerated moral story. Unfortunately the message was lost in chaos. Walken offers good performance but Black is key and annoying (I usually find it very funny). No, it's not a terrible film, but I still do not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man" and "Sleepers") is responsible for this - it's not the worst movies of all time but it's certainly much better. I wish there is a Va-Poo-Rize - so we can make this movie disappear forever ....
