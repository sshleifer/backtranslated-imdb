... but I regret that I saw it. Since IMDb classifications are relatively high (and they must also be relatively high on Netflix), I think I put them in my waiting list because they advertised as a nice comedy from the UK, a category that produced many of the movies I liked so much. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls within the category of comedy films that do not usually laugh and inhabited by Hollywood movies produced and managed without talent. Brenda Blytheen is a capable actress and I have loved her in other films. The concept - the gardener growing marijuana to overcome the penury she finds herself facing after her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the strenuous efforts of the team to produce humor, the film falls on his face (his fall may be more entertaining) regarding my wife and me. Be careful, gentle reader, all the bizarre British comedy does not work. This is a reckless one.
