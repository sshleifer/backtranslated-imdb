Short version: The seeds are worthless. It's just a derivative and a Donnie. Without spirit. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you do not see any of the films that contain the mysterious "psychological horror" type, this film is likely to melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening montage of the abuse of real animals will be enough to open your eyes to the potential for savagery on the video, and perhaps the most unforgettable scene in the film later than you can handle. You will play your emotions in a way that may not have another film. <br /> <br /> But this is if you do not have much experience in this genre. If you've seen the real thing ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, you'll find, as you did, it's very difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared this with old videos. I understand this comparison. Such as video villains, "seeds" more violent than the mainstream horror film is less accurate. But the reason why the wicked videos are still known to us is not just for the reasons listed above - those that are still common have something special. Let me be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who stumble have a "spirit". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriel Crisante, director of Burial Land, in an interview with the new DVD -ish: "... we will not have more movies like this, because today, technology has surpassed imagination. Many things will disappear, because small films like this will not be produced, and today we have extraordinary cool tricks that are expensive but cool ... Today, horror, horror films of this kind cost more than a million dollars ... Real, made by our hands ". <br /> <br /> It may be a mistake to compare the horror of the old school seriously. But Crisanti has hit a nail on his head. Even in the most exploitative situations it seems to have been, the best vulgar videos were followed by a primitive "truth". This is where Paul falls short. It seems like he saw the films and did not understand them. Everything in the checklist exists ... BS on "Making a statement about humanity", a scene of obscene torture, etc. But, says Crisanti, "cool." Jury is all CGI. Everything looks like scenes collected from other films of different genres. Slow speed soooo. Man, very slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: a gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, BS is enough. A weak film.
