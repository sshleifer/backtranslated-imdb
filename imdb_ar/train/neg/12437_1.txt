"Home Alone 3" is the first Home Alone movie that does not show Culkin in the main role and the same bad guys. However, the plot is very similar to the original film "Home Alone". Instead of two wicked comedians, we get three or four of them. This film contains some traps, but it also contains a long scene with remote control car. Hysterectal humor is fixed as well, but the little boy and the bad guys really fail to make an impact in this film. (Not pun intended). This film does not present anything new or different from previous films, and there is really no warm feeling, holiday or sub-novels of the other two films. It's more than pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh because the characters did not really do it for me. I would not recommend this film as it is very boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, check out the original "Home Alone".
