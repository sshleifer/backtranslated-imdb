I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with fairly strong expectations. The film has great actors and concludes at the festival so it should be good, right? How wrong you are. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when the director was talking before the film about how when he was directing a ring of wisdom he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (director / writer at Wiseguy making his film for the first time = Blah) Well, the Edison director / writer must have some pictures of Kevin Spacey killing a homeless man, because I can not see how he (along with the other actors in the film) agrees that this is a disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is very shocking! It's a combination of every cliche boiled steel cop ever. There is nothing new with Edison. The acting was bad and the trend was worse. It looked like a loop above from a wiseguy. This was the best directly in the video film I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Some examples of bad silly moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dancing around his apartment without any reason for rock and roll ... Justin Timberlake gets creative criticism of his grace while surrounded his apartment by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird ... 3 guys shooting at the head ... <br /> <br /> This movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Edison!
