This reminds me when I was a reborn believer who was a minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be engaged in heaven before that happened. It was before I discovered that Christianity was a collection of garbage. I am now an atheist, and this proves only that the doctor "always saved" and that Christians tell us that he is nothing more than elves. If this is true, why did I leave many years after I was born again? Yes, I have really saved. I pray in order that the guilty sinners may pray with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their sacred book, they will discover that their God thinks like rape, genocide, abortion and many other atrocities. They may be surprised when they learn that there is no place to mention the word "rapture".
