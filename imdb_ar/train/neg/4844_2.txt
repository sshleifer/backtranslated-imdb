I am certainly in the minority opinion about this. The Hurt Locker won "Best Picture" awards from critics more than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is a minimum plot and a small development of personality. They are disarming bombs and fighting and disarming more bombs. This is the entire movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part is that the camera does not stop moving and is constantly vibrating. This was a modern novelty in filmmaking and should make it look more realistic because it has a cheap, documentary look. The camera was shaking so much that made me feel nauseous to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not care about war films and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not need to take my words for it because critics like it.
