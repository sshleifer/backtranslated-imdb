This film is likely to be in favor of the teachings. <br /> <br /> Why write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives for the first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he appears to be a Muslim because he wears a head and has kept his amulet and public clothes. He has a six-year-old child, wearing the same headdress and is therefore Muslim, although the mother is Christian. It seems that the main character chooses to be a Muslim and his son becomes a Muslim. It does not seem that any of the main male characters, ie Christians, are born a child. There seems to be more Muslims in the world than this film at its end, so it seems.
