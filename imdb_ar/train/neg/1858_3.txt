A serial killer dies in a blizzard and turns into the evil twin of the snowman. Then the wave of murder goes on. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. This is scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it is a kind of cheese. I saw him on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay the money to see him. It has all the charm and style of a low budget movie that may become a cult film. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm not just in it. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there are some scenes that I find amusing. Such as a bathtub scene and a post-explosion scene with a Picasso signal. He was also delighted to watch the many ways in which the heroes try to kill Jack and apparently does not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good budget comedy with "B", but it's a low-budget horror horror film.
