Devin Hamilton may be known for his new name in legendary Bedouin entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival at the independent studio occurred at a time when budget and production values ​​were at their lowest levels in years. However, in his short career, Hamilton established himself as an innovative director who manages creative and original stories. Now, this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they differ from the usual in this kind of horror. <br /> <br /> In his first appearance, "Bleed", Hamilton presents us with a creative development in the bright sub genre. Madi (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but she seems to have also found her boyfriend in Sean (Danny Walsk), and life seems to be finally smiling for a long time after many sad events. To join a party with Sean's friends, tell her they have created a "Nada" where members have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Obviously they are joking, but Madi wants to fit her hard, actually killing someone. After this event, someone begins to kill the rest of the Club members one by one. It's up to the physical to know what's going on because anyone can be a killer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very exciting character played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It's a very interesting development on this kind of getting a leading actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton has not developed the whole story a little better. The film seems very slow sometimes, and the general feeling is feeling a good idea to get lost on a bad film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the crew is weird, meaning that all the female actresses are very good, while the male casts very bad. Dani Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a stereotype perfectly. Julie Stryn, Brink Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small and exquisite shorts in their small roles. Also, there are a lot of nudity (male and female) and the actors have a very good appearance, so it really is a plus. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurts the film in the effects section, where there are very few amazing scenes and not graphical (perhaps because they look bad); however, given the budget, the film looks good at least. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's most recent effort, the Delta Sex Die! , Is the best and most entertaining film in general. Although this is not as bad as other well-known films, it still suffers from a lot of flaws and may be interesting only to Debbie Rochon fans or to non-budget independent film fans. 10/04
