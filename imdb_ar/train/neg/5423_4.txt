I have been using IMDb a few years ago, but I have not written any comments before. However, this film was very disappointing to me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) so much that I could not keep silent anymore. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of the New Yorker (Tim Robbins), who is so disturbed by the noise pollution that he treats the ego as "The Rectifier" and destroys any cars found with the alarm. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie to be somewhat misnamed. Although there are one or two other sources of noise being processed or mentioned, the only true focus of our hero is the car alarms. Car alarms, Car alarms, Car alarms. There really is no other focus. When the film tries to link other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to have just been put to the advantage of Rubens' personal behavior. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by the noise. No one likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have this inner desire to take a baseball bat for a screaming vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. I say "a lot" because there is also a blatantly veiled sexual relationship (including a completely unnecessary trio) that is clearly posed to those filmgoers who need such things to enjoy a movie. Frankly, it is striking. <br /> <br /> Robin's character, after a very short time in the film, becomes completely unbreakable. It seems less that he decided not to tolerate the noise anymore, and more by focusing too much on the noise that began to lose his mind. The first half of the film is basically a story of how to turn from just an angry man who breaks a car into the hero of the little guy The Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not happen. He renames himself. <br /> <br /> I can hold on for a while. The disturbing social commentary comes from time to time to add to the film's claims, and the self-made smile that never leaves Robbins's face does not help either. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it is very clear what this film is trying to be on, because it greatly clears your throat, but in my opinion, it fails greatly. Only one man saw, cheers.
