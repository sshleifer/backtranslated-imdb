This movie receives a lot of play recently during the day on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people are interested in comparing it to the head of Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see him is Matt Lattanze the attractive. Yum! Although I must say that Matt was more than a long time old to play as a secondary teacher. If he were a woman, they would have made him play the role of a mother in high school! (Am I just, or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duval?) Oh yeah, the plot - who cares? highjinx typical teen played by adults.
