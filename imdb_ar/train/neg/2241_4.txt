I remember that I enjoyed this a few years ago but I came again, I wonder why. I think it always looks good and the girls work well but the men prefer to leave the side down. Why, why in many English films about sex should we have such incompetent men next to beautiful girls? What's more, it begins enough and can be expected as a similar sexual masquerade in "confessions" but about a third of the way (as we began to enjoy the beautiful Me Me Lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that, but the sequence of rock clubs and central cannabis is very forced and looks folded. In short, this is not as silly and innocent or as clever as it seems intended. Richard O'Sullivan, as a central figure, could have helped, but I think this is one of his worst performances. Just worth it to the ladies.
