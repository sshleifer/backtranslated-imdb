Last week, I took a look at Nielsen's weekly ratings, and there was the Veronica March, supposedly the "best show you do not see". <br /> <br /> Well, they're right because you are not. It was broadcast twice and ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> This is the least rated show on any national broadcast network ... and it's worth it. I tried to watch him several times because of all the press coverage she described as "fantastic" and "realistic" in life and all that nonsense. The reality was otherwise. Veronica Mars bears. It is unrealistic to the extent that it is due, and it deserves to be abolished to a great extent. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why CW felt compelled to put its opening table at the lowest rated display in memory, two years after continuing commercial and technical failures.
