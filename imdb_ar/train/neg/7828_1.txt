Plus two days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just another part of the long string series of Tarantino that has appeared since the game Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is amusing in the first five minutes, but then filmmakers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and outrageous violence to increase the thigh. You're better off skipping this one.
