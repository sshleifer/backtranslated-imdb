My wife and I had high hopes in this film, but it was a great disappointment. It was an original American version of Mr. Magu. A pathetic father fails in everything he tries, for example fishing, fishing, in a clear way is to subject his family to wild illusions. His "vision" is not only ridiculous, but he lies in front of his son several times about different things. Words can not express how bad this film is. The children and the wife are very real, making the film more sad. I do not get a sense of humor ... unless you love to laugh at other people who fool themselves. I do not understand how this can happen for prizes. Keeping your dollars, it is not worth the rent.
