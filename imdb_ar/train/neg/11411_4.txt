The story line has been redrafted several times; "Breath in Life in a Retirement Home". Many plays, films, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have won the theme endlessly, but they remain an excellent platform for character studies. <br /> <br /> If Gideon is designed with greater enthusiasm, he can be wonderful, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is completely submerged in the cliches (even the subtitle and summary of "Gideon's Simple Wisdom" almost made him laugh because of its ineffectiveness). Emotional representation is often the last straw of this weak film, but what remains of it is so gentle that the focus of actors is irrelevant.
