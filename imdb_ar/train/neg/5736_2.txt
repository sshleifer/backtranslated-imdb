This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years !! You can grab 5 people randomly from the streets and they may behave better than anyone else in this movie. An absolute waste of time to watch it. I just gave him 2 because I love gory movies but that's just rubbish. Acting (I use the term "very loose") is annoying, please tell me that the five main actors in this were making their first film ever? Do not waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better film somehow. I can not believe that someone spent money making this, I hope the producers cost only $ 50,000 - it seems to be a school project, prepared by children who did not get an idea. Did you make this even the cinema ??
