I did not expect much from this film, but I did not expect the film to be so bad. Chris Rock does a good job here, and you can not feel that his trailer is real, and I think the film would have been a bit better if the drama or romantic scenes would be a lesser part of the film and more / had the best humor involved. The film looks like filmmakers were suffering from bad headaches. In "making" it does not show one smile. This is a very bad film! I gave her three out of ten because of the few smiles she gave me, but I never laughed!
