As a girl, Henaku moved from her small village to Tokyo, leaving behind her best friends, Fumia and Saori. She returned as a young woman, surprised when she found that Saori had died when she was a teenager. They unite with Fumia and are terrified when they learn that Saori is being revived in mysterious circumstances across the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I hired this because I love Asian horror and I think that Chiaki Koriyama is an elegant actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku with one word, it would be "phacia." This film is ridiculous, boring, filmed badly, unimaginable, and most of all it is not surprising. Kuriyama has the minimum screen time of the Resurrection, and her character is given little work.
