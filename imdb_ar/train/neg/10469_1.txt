Yes I admit that I cried during this film. It was so unbelievably disappointing that I could only help myself cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has performed again. First with a million dollar man (a former professional wrestler) in their program, now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega code follows a series of religious-oriented films. It was very interesting, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it inaccurate in the Bible. The film follows what is known as the "code of the Bible" instead of following the actual Bible. This film is very weak; from writing to directing it to its horrific and fun work. It is frustrating that people actually made the effort in this film. It looked like a late-night movie seen by someone on the US channel or a live video to the house instead of a theatrical movie that was released. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not watching this movie, even if your life depends on it.
