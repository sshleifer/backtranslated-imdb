This weak excuse for Sundance's amateur show is a great example of what's wrong with most independent filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is something like the art of cinematography. Just take a 16 mm camera and direct it to someone who has a line that does not make for a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we should consider ourselves lucky because the director did not pick up someone's video camera. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the films are supposed to be independent of real people. There is nothing real in this film. None of the characters appear remotely human. <br /> <br /> What he encounters are images of the imagination of a writer trying to convince his friends by showing them how cool and sharp he is. . <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this is not a good book, or a good guide. <br /> <br /> The rest is the peel of a bad film somehow sought out to Sundance. It's hard to believe that this was one of the best films made ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it made me lose my respect for the Sundance brand.
