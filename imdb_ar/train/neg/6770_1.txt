I went to see this movie with my 17 year old daughter. I insisted on showing the show program, not because I was tight, but I just felt I was feeling it. In NASCAR's spirit, this is the dream of the shepherd. Lots of outrageous ads, are almost eligible for commercial information, if they are not so-called proxy. In line with tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with cheese storylines, the car is just a "car" (not intended as pun) for this ball of corn for moving pictures. Previous Herbie premiums (although they are cheese also) were produced during the most dangerous times, making them easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, Queen of Disney's ruling drama, has no ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would participate in such a project. Just a snack bar, it was the biggest rip!
