Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) lives in Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother frequently and visits her grave continuously (conveniently located in the cemetery just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> Starts well with a sequence Really strange in the cemetery ... then collapses. The story is thin and there are tons of padding to make the movie 85 minutes. Representation is terrible in all areas (with Cole being the worst). Badly addressed with some of the worst editing I have ever seen in any film. The scenes (and sound) are cut only without rhyme or reason. The film also contains a terrible sound (post-production). <br /> <br /> As for blood and violence - Vensah! There is very little and there seems to be an incredibly fake. I have never seen a fake-looking blood - like ketchup! Boring, useless - behind the film is a truly forgotten engine. You can skip this one.
