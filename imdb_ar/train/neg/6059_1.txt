I must say I admire the man who created Halloween / Mist / Christine / The Thing - perhaps his best film. <br /> <br /> Then I got these POS. I can not reasonably believe he made any effort at all as he did with the Burns Cigarette. His son had at least a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at this from the point of view that it does not look like a movie. It seemed as if someone else had his face for one thing. I will not believe that Carpenter made any effort at all. <br /> <br /> I was only listening to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog, and it was fantastic, especially for times. <br /> <br /> He used a style that nobody had and was doing well in his films.
