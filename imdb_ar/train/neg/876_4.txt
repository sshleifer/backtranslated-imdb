Until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this film was probably the worst film for Jackie Chan (except for his works before 1978, which I'm not familiar with). The final battle sequence is all that: It is long, good and intense - in fact, it is one of Chan's most important professional features. But to get to it, you have to sit in "a lot of comedy" that children may laugh at the age of five (oh, look! Someone threw tomatoes on that man's face) and endless "football" scenes. Not to mention dubbing (which includes the line "How do I turn it off? It's not a click" - see to see what it points to). Dragon Lord deserves the lease in the final battle on its own, but the rest of the film is only for Jamaican collectors, even for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
