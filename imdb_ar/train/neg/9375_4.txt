It is time to see a film that remains unbiased towards these ancient Indian traditions. Sometimes it is clear how most "doctors" are charlatans, so they lie about how not to charge their clients. While wearing their gold watches, the "donation" box is mandatory. Note that there are only two people who have received "healing" while we observe a few cases. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that while observing that mercury is not toxic, the smallest note of an Indian bank is Rs5, while India's average salary is 1,700 RU / month.
