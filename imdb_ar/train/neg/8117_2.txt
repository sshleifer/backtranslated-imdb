"Terrible people" must be the subtitle of this terrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, look out your window in real life. But if you want to see unhappy people doing dim things, you'll have to watch this awesome movie by Mike Lee. The characters talk extensively, but they can not actually communicate with each other. why not? My supposed things are that we are all as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and wants to portray real life. But we are not, he has failed.
