If no service is offered to him by "Exorcist II: The Heretic" in 1977, it is hard to imagine what Richard Burton saw in this terrible exercise in the non-excitement. I've seen all this before: Burton plays the role of a writer who discovered at an early age that he had the ability to move non-living objects through the power of his mind (and you thought Carrie had no effect on Hollywood!). Although quoted from the novel by Peter van Gernaway, "Medusa" plays like recycled goods, although the special effects at the cathedral's conclusion are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is fairly present as a doctor, but otherwise the support team is very weak. Burton is humiliated but tired ... and he can not be saved even by mental mobility at this stage. * 1/2 of ****
