Because of the Writers' Union strike of 1988, they had to fire on this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much crap, and consists of repeated cut clips + paste from Season 2 and described by the writer, Maurice Hurley as "awful, just awesome". <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not wait just to shoot something decent knows. I guess because of the blow from production, I could only launch a flashback episode or maybe Rodinberry was so sick at the time that he could not veto this. This episode also represents the final appearance of Diana Mulduor (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
