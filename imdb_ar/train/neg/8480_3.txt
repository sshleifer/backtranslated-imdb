I can not say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But again, I can not say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Well, so she is a girl who skates on the ice basically, she is good at it, and you want to go to an expensive, intolerable school and you must take a hockey bonus. She has to hide the secret of skiing from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress who plays Katelin. She could not cry at all to save her life, and she began to cry with her voices, like a small child pretending to cry in his own way. <br /> <br /> Katlin was just an annoying person. The way you tried to act is all nice and useful to people. And the part that the skiers call their names and say something about her choreographer says she's "drawing the line" made me upset. <br /> <br /> We all knew where he would go with Spencer. Classics did not like each other and it was a kind of meeting in the end. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skiing but if you do not mind the main skater being very annoying. It is good to kill time mainly.
