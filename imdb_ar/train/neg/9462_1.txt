inappropriate. PG rating obtained by this film is another wrong step from MPAA production. Whale Rider gets PG-13 but this movie gets PG? Please. Do not be fooled by parents. Taking a child in a primary school to this film is a big mistake. In many times, I found myself uncomfortable, not only because humor was not suitable for children, but also because it was completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible film. The overall casting and appearance of the film are the only two faithful souls. Beautiful Kelly Preston and Alec Baldwin (or always hate in this case) Alec Baldwin are good at their roles although Preston is almost too pretty for a role like this. Children are modalized and show it, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning represents the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did you mention that there was a big cat talking in this movie? Mike Myers is utterly pitiful. I did not like Shrek's voice, and I really believe now that he should not let Myers near the world of children's movies again. His portrayal of The Cat is a toned version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, had to have moved away, but it came, even if it was just for a day, destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and conflict. <br /> <br /> Cat in the Hat may be the worst film ever made for children.
