I usually enjoy early Loretta Young films: her acting at the time was light and smooth, and she certainly knows how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser of the word go except the funny support turn by Glenda Farrell. Young is a girl checking to speak talking to her husband (Paul Lucas) to become a bridge player in the tournament. It is not the most cinematic game, and the long, modern middle part in which their marriage breaks down kills the film. <br /> <br /> However, there is something interesting. With Lucas and Ferdinand Gotskalk starting their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, and even a plunger in the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. This is the first use of the freezing frame I saw in an American film. I hope the rest is creative and funny.
