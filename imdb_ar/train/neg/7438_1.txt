This movie is completely waste of time, the plot is terrible, and the dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Acting is fine, but actors never have a plot or a scenario to work with. Well, photography has some special effects, but again there is nothing interesting in this film to watch it. There is no logical progression to the story, the story line is absolute nonsense. It's not so scary. For the film to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This film has absolutely no credibility. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and make-up work are done poorly, or often less than average. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste your time in this movie unless you are curious to see a completely awful movie.
