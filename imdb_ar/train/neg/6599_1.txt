Who was George S. Scott? George C. Scott is a famous actor. Practically any film I have been in is better off for it. Now George had nothing at all about this film ..., but he once said something that describes the film in T. <br /> <br /> I do not remember his words exactly, but he basically said that great writing can save Bad behavior, but can not save great behavior Bad writing This little remark was not more honest than it was in "The New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> The selection of the crusades was perfect. Brunson Pinchott (Laurel) and Gailard Sarten (Hardy) are not only looking at the parts, they are doing very well in mimicking the real deal (behaviors and all). This film should stand as a permanent testimony to their talents. However, this film flattens on his face when it comes to (guessed) writing. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the opening dialogue between Benkut and Sarten (who was "character") a brief muzzle involving a taxi, this film is an absolute routine. <br /> <br /> Problem 1: A lot of time and effort has been made in the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wanted to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I want to see is Stan and the (or at least their stand-by) positions. Much of the screen time has been devoted to explaining the plot or the not very ridiculous secondary characters around which the plot is going. <br /> <br /> However, even if this movie is all jokes, it will still be left to us ... <br /> <br /> ... Problem # 2: Most jokes are what I can call Relaxation. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "easing"? <br /> <br /> In a slap, the character is overly abused for comedic influence (Ala Looney Tunes, 3 harassers ... or what about Laurel and Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In a "ventilation" aerobic exercise (as I know it), the character is slightly hurt or disturbed, and the filmmakers play this comic effect. <br /> <br /> The illustration may help: <br /> <br /> In Loney Tunes, Duffy Duck is shot by Elmer Vood. His bill falls and he brings it back. This is a classic teasing. <br /> <br /> In this "jewel", some people collide accidentally. They turn around and tell him to be careful, and keep going. This is not a distraction. This is not so funny. This is just ... boring ... this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. It seems like the bread and butter of this film. The writers and directors take these boring moments and act as if they are supposed to be funny. Admittedly, the example I have just given is the most extreme case, but I can only mitigate it much from recession. <br /> <br /> Short story long: The movie does not work because the text failed to take advantage of Pinchot and Sartain abilities to impersonate Stan's character and #. Instead, the script takes advantage of displaying lame charts and jokes. Watching this movie is mainly seen by two excellent impersonators who have not given any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but an incredible aid for sleeping. <br /> <br /> I say Give this one a miss and stick to the real deal (just as long as you stay away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
