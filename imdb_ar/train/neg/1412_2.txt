While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie called "The 10 of Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Product: I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Author: This is awesome! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Product: We can only rent it for a day. I think we will have to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Author: So we're hiring him for a day. The film is an hour and a half long. The working day is eight hours. Failed to see a problem. <br /> <br /> Product: But ... he'll have to spend time joining his character. <br /> <br /> Author: So we play a role in personality is essentially the same. <br /> <br /> Product: But he will still need to understand his motivations and all that. You're not saying we're playing a big actor doing a low-budget film, right? <br /> <br /> Author: Why not? <br /> <br /> Product: This is ridiculous! But good, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our film. I think we have to make the film in Los Angeles as well. <br /> <br /> Author: Of course. <br /> <br /> Product: This scenario is a burden of nonsense. We'd better make money on this. If that happens, let Morgan Freeman make Wal-Mart, Target, or one of those stores, so someone will want to sell DVDs. <br /> <br /> Author: Sure thing! <br /> <br /> Product: Wait a second ... What's this about a small bodega with "ten elements or less" express lane? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I think this is very strange. But we can not change the address now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my program really resembles much of the similarity with reality, but did not do so "10 elements or less." This is a good case, but bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. When you watch a stand-alone movie, you expect to try to move a type of message. I guess they probably were trying to get the message "Do not let anything hinder you" old that was executed to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 elements or less", the only message I got was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
