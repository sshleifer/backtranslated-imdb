In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a stranger, except for Warner Bros.. I've read that Humphrey Bogart, watching James Cane with that big cowboy hat on his head, said he looked like a mushroom . Right! Kenny and Bogart are very urban, and the twentieth century can not be trusted in a Western film. The story here was no surprise and did not help. Every 10 minutes, I see that I can see Bogart and Kani dropping their small rifles and putting hands in machine guns to escape the group in a black car in 1930.
