A film about alopecia (Erica Gavin) that has a pair of Mountie you love ... but she loves sex too! In the film, you get several men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a lesbian (tame) sequence. <br /> <br /> Russ Meyer was placed on the map and was (I think) the first film to have been rated critically at all. It was a big hit when I came out. Unfortunately, this is not good. <br /> <br /> It's a good guide and a great Gaffin Erika (all that happened to her) and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards, it became very delicate. . I am surprised that they have received the NC-17 classification now - there is no hardcore sex and only female nudes and there is no nudity for males at all. It is also (unfortunately) too boring and the policy was finally added confusing (and very silly). It is worth noting that what was considered a major shock in 1968. I supposed I saw the cut version (which has the R rating) but I only heard a few seconds here and there missing. <br /> <br /> The next film "Beyond the Valley of Puppies" is much better and has a good history. Catch it instead.
