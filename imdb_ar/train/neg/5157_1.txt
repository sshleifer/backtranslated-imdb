I really despised this film when I saw him around the age of six or seven because I was a great admirer of Robin Williams and nothing could do wrong. So this. This complete rubbish ruined Robin for me for a long time. I just recovered recently through his funny but dangerous course on Fathers Day but then continued to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man I think was called but the basic point is. Robben must be getting much better jobs now and he has returned to the performance of the mud that grew up with this "classic".
