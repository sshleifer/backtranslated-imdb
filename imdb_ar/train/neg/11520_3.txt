I did not enjoy this movie at all. For one, I found it difficult and tacky, without a reason. I also felt that it was hatred of women (against women.) Also, the film does not seem to be about anything, and I did not find any of the characters likable. In fact, there does not seem to be any point in it. I might miss something, but for me, this film is a waste of time to a great extent, when it could have done something more productive and enjoyable, such as using my face as a pin. James Garner in this thing, as well as Si. Thomas Howell, Shirley Jones, and James Cromwell. They're all lost here, I'm sure. These were a low point in each of their careers. Genely Harrison (of the subsequent years of Three's Company) is also in the film, and it is nice to see her in an unsteady role. But otherwise, they can not rise above the average For me, Tank is 3/10
