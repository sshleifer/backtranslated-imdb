To anyone not familiar with c.S. Book Forrester This movie must be interesting. They are colorful, vibrant and highly adventurous, but for those of us who know the original stories they are appalling. I could barely sit in it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the screen writers seem to have to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that are hard to imagine. But why does the scriptwriter rewrite the story instead of just adapting it? In this case, the book outweighs themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: there was no rebellion in the era of fame. The officers took over the ship after the half-mad captain was driven by sheer madness when he fell through a gate - for obvious reasons but never offered. There was no military court. The Court of Inquiry was conducted in almost an atmosphere of congratulation. Captain Bello does not appear in this part of the Horn Blour epic, nor the wife of Col. Ortega. Horn Blaur, himself, has never been in the ship either on board the ship or on the beach. There is a lot of this manipulation of Forster's story. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I believe that the repeated use of the movie for the Flashback device harms the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, then, why did the scriptwriter have to ruin a good story?
