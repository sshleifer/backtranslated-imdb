You should not watch this movie unless you are trying to kill yourself. I think this film can actually cause severe damage to the brain. The main characters are Kevin, Amy, who has no hero, her sinister friend Kyle, wearing red shorts with sex on the phone, and Daveny, a frightened and horny girl who is supposed to be "nice." The sense of how she dressed, and her strange friend Nick, an army recruiter could hint at anything. No, I'm not oblique, that's how the movie goes. The movie itself is a collection of 1986 gremlin, where you will only find the effect of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, launched by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make dreams of someone's dreams come true, then kill the victims. Yes, I guessed it - in the end, they end up in a strip club, where the greatest dream we throw is revealed - it wants to be a stripper! See, I've seen this click across the MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Cervo, and Crow T. A robot makes a big laugh from the wreckage of this movie train and still makes me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I no longer give you any conspiracy, because its revival gives me this great urgency to lead a panic in my mind. Moreover, it is not as if there is a plot worthy of mention. They should put a general warning to the surgeon on this film.
