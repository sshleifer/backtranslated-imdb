We were given this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left unexplained, because of the strange scenes of someone eating in a very disgusting way, plus scenes of a decomposed body. <br /> <br /> There is no need to display any of the above in a graphical way. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, relates to three loosely connected stories, none of which end satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The bonus hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that links all three short essays. <br /> <br /> First, we have Dylan McDermott, and look at him well, as a wanted criminal escapes to Mexico to escape the law and hunter bonuses, when riding in a border town and watching a sad salon girl face played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of Hemingway's daughters, I'm not sure which one, playing the role of a western wife on the only border that recognizes a nearby, attractive red woman, we soon realize she has been in the rugged terrain for a very long time. <br /> <br /> The end of the film returns to the reward hunter and what happens to him, where the final scene in the film is beyond rational understanding.
