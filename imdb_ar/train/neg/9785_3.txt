This film, for the post-school special, is not so bad, this is the problem. Nothing happens. Feel as if you are still in class. A man teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good players in paintball. We have never been able to see these underdogs in bad performance because the good player is training them. All of them suddenly turn into good players by meditating. Also there are a lot of characters and not personal development. He spends a lot of time on his main character and his sexy sister and is not enough for some other children. It could have been a "bad news" (original) because there was a girl in a boys' team, but there was no feeling at all of this film. It has no feeling and leaves a heavy pain in your bones after watching it, and it is not fun to carry it, and it is not fun to watch it, it's just a kind of ... there. Normal. boring. Something you will see after school before a nap before the evening. As long as the day was long it was a long day to watch this movie.
