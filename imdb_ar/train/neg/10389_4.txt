Director Kevin Connor and romantic Action Champion / Romantic Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story in Japan. They achieved moderate success in the 1970s, with the likes of Time Lost Land (1975), Basic Land (1976), and so forth. Without plastic monsters carrying the narrative, the results were lamentations and derivatives in the most terrifying way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an introduction in the 19th century, where a samurai husband killed his wife and her lover before committing suicide. Step forward So far, the married couple, Ted and Laura, are visiting Japan and moving to the house where the tragedy took place. <br /> <br /> No surprises in what happens next, as the souls of the dead begin to take over the new population with family friend Alex (McClure) who plays the role of wife lover. <br /> <br /> Everything thrives clumsily with the elegance and grace of an elephant charging, to an inevitable (but surprisingly pessimistic) conclusion. The main points of interest are two weak pieces ('The Omen' has a lot to answer in promoting this film as a standard horror piece), and the love-making scenes that characterize George George's good taste but very exotic. The first is a long piece inspired by "Do not Look Now" with its master, complete with piano music; the second is much shorter (perhaps insisting) on ​​tangled with McClure, both of which seem very uncomfortable. In any case, each cloud has a silver lining and shows each of its viewers to its wonderful explorers so as not to waste everything. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not decide whether the "house where Evil Dwells" is garbage, water litter, or masculine fun. If you are not in this type, there is nothing at all here, but there may be enough for horror lovers to stir up a ruddy smile and gesture appreciation appreciation effort. <br /> <br /> The best scene - anywhere else movie, the big crab, climbing trees, Japanese mute mute the show was stolen. The mythical scene of the meals, where a ghostly head appears in the girl's soup. When you see this phenomenon, ask about the type of soup (!!!!), to tell the beef and vegetables, before pronouncing the immortal line "Ugh - there is a terrible face in the shorbe." If that was not enough, then reply, "Come on, eat your soup for Papa." Laurel and Hardy rest in a piece.
