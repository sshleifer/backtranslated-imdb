Makes one wonder how this display is still on the air. There was one husband who stayed together, married and had children, but everyone broke up. What is the point of continuing this? The show can be amusing at first. She sees all the girls closing on one man, whom they almost all like immediately. It's just like in real life! Girls begin to bias side by side and show themselves (or so we think). But this man is left to decide who chooses to believe he can marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What exactly is love? How can you fall for someone when you have to choose them? This offer is incredible. Have you ever thought that online dating was bad, but should people go to the TV to find love? It's not realistic. How can a girl be with a man when he comes out with several other people, making with them? None of these questions were answered, and finally when the offer ends, you know there will be no happy ending in the future. For everything we know, everything is written.
