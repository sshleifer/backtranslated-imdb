"Crazy Dog Time" ... "Happy Trigger" no matter how you want to call it ... Simply do not hit the mark. Maybe just me, maybe I do not like the comedy movies done by Jangster (as I thought that Oscar and Johnny Dangirius and Mafia have also sucked) is probably "sharper sharper" than all the comedy, but not just as brilliant and sharp as him (Or other reviewers) Make it <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, and Vic Thing were out of date to start making it an ongoing gag that is sometimes painful to see. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes in the site or sense of the period it was supposed to be. The majority of the film is set either in "Dreyfus's Club" or in a variety of dark offices / rooms. .. (What was however a sit-in sit-gun Goldblum win?) <br /> <br /> The cast was ... on paper excellent (fantastic to see Silva & Drago) but the characters were killed by the time they had to develop. Richard Preyors was a joke veil! The element of romance and love in the film also disabled him. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll be back any time soon.
