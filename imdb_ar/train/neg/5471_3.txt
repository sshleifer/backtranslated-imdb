The Troma-trash model, the flick of the 1980s is one of the highlights of the famous production studio Lloyd Kaufman, along with The Toxic Avenger, released a year ago. "The Toxic Avenger" is much better if you ask me, but this shaky flickering flicker can also be tolerated; just make sure you leave your brain full capacity on the door. In Tromafil, a small town that proudly claims to be the world's poisonous chemical capital, it certainly does not lie. The safety precautions at the local nuclear power station are substandard (Homer Simpson was never inventive) and toxic waste is leaked to the nearby high school, the first victim to be poisoned is a nerd of stereotypes, Moving green things from all the cavities of his body, but believed that his death was an accident because he did not have microwaves at home at least! Oh, humanity! Soon, however, nuclear leaks also affect the herbivores in school and the thing really started in chaos After a detailed smoking at a party, "Class of Nuke 'em High" is a horror film industry at the bottom of the picture, with silly dialog boxes that hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word Unlike the above, "The Toxic Avenger", this film suffers from dull and long moments where nothing important happens, For example when Chrissy and Warren try to discover what is wrong with their hormones. Raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the performances are unforgettable amateur actresses. Follow only if you are an avid Troma-fanatic.
