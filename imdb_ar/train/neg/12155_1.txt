If this film was written and directed to produce a classic bad cult movie, it might be (I say perhaps) a great success. Have you ever sat and watched a movie so awful that it has become wonderful in terms of its mistakes? Well this is it. Each representative must be nominated for the worst performance awards. It will be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that has very little value at all. Everything, from the opening scenes defies logic. Dialogue is unreasonable and completely illogical. As the behavior and general story of the film itself. The really amazing thing is that some of the batons in the management meeting room have already made decisions to spend money on this garbage. Wonderful.
