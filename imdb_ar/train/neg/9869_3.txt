Did not care about the film, the book was the best. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I found an answer to my question. Now I look like a puppet, but I think I will still make my comments. And yes, beautiful British Columbia *** or why they took it from its location in Coastal South Carolina? (Standing this question) was a necessary place to texture the book and change it was part of my disappointment towards the film. Oh, I've only read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here's my other major problem with the film. Kim Basinger was very angry and not at all what he thought of the book. I know the book was the book and the film. Well not very good. I found the personal in the book more sympathetic. The book also evokes rural, semi-primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was more visually impressive, it distorted the story and seemed to contradict the characters.
