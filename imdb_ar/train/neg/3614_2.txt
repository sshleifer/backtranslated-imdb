Schizophrenia escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York City and teachers soon began to take off at St Trinity University. The new teacher Julie (Fransine Forbes) has to deal with the red herring mess. Despite 78 consecutive minutes, this low-cost segment continues until you find someone you think is a killer from the start, as such. Director Richard Heinz is barely breaking a race with some lame lame gradient but the anger probably delivers that the audience of the 1980s was probably eager. For all amateur anthropologists there, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 1980s so that you could see all the culture, beliefs and practices of living people from this remote place. The film got some credit for its show on "The Final Girl". You rarely see it. It is also good to watch a horror film in which the priest is the murderer. Do not trust the clergy, beloved film industry? Fortunately, this one is only a false priest and adjusts. It still works on the elevation of moral ground though.
