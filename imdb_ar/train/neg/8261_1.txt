I was looking forward to watching this film and realized then that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the representatives had drowned in the unnecessary swearing in. Now I am not proud in any way, but to shout dirty at each other is not a good film. Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (seeing his performance in the horrible life of bad things) and the tone of "Cockney" is so bad as the Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many of these films are "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" that must be experienced before filmmakers realize that the word f, word c, etc. does not replace the appropriate dialogue.
