When this film was released, one of the great capsule film reviews was born at all: Sphinx Stinks. It is, but in a charming way. The absurd choice, starting from the top: Frank Langela and Mr. John Gilgod as Egyptians? There is not enough make-up in Cairo, at least not during the making of this film. But it's fun to see them trying. The presentations turn into a series of mummy (sorry, clear observation) to the top, with very few stops between them. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems to have been unable to find Egypt on the map, much less on its archaeological treasures. Partly due to at least some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited at every scene of this movie. In my opinion, films that involve a curse or derive their basis from a subject that is not limited to a particular category, such as Egyptology, have become ripe for a silly written dialogue. Do not disappoint, and convergence proves a double fuss. This plot contains one source of dramatic tension: Can this become stupid and less believable? The answer is, usually, yes. The site shots are beautiful, and the design is very good, and it is the only constant reminder that this was not a low budget production. This is the fact that many well-known faces serve in such an unintended laugh. Cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
