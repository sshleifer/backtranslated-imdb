The plot was boring, the girls were sick, and apparently the supposed Italian bullets had never been heard in an Italian accent. One of them said the boys were cute in this film, but it seemed to be full of average people. There were literally no redeemable features for this film. <br /> <br /> I think this is a graveyard for actors who will never work, with a regrettable exception to Olsen's twins that seem to interest people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I hope Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from entertainment. They have no place in it.
