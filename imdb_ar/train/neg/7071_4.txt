When this film was released in 1997, "special effects", as they were, were bad. It was possible to date them even in the 1980s, and even some of the films produced in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX works. Certainly no one involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. It is a great departure from the usual things of director Fred Olin Rai, most of which carry the word "bikini" in the title (bikini pirate, bikini string gangs, bikini girls from Lost Planet, etc.) and more than just T & Directly aimed at kiddies. You have to give it credit for diversification !! This was a minor success in the live video cult, which later resulted in a series of results - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. De Wallace-Stone (who began his career very quickly after "ET") in 1982 plays "The Invisible Mother" from the movie title and returns to the sequel. It is fair to say that most of the actors were at a stage of their career where they would be willing to work on just about anything to pay bills in the past. That month - except maybe Trenton Knight like Josh, that even though he was working before this film, this child actor did not work again after the sequel, "Mom Invisible 2." Perhaps the movie was cursed. Not bad in this film, for a child actor, he is very good - not better or worse than any of his most experienced participants. <br /> <br /> We mentioned above, the effects of "obscurity" are mildly mild, the trend is weak, writing is clear and nothing is acting to write about. There are plenty of goodies though, no doubt this film will be perfectly watched by anyone under the age of 10. Most adults In doing a job disappear on its own while it is running, I will not blame them a bit!
