As with most films of Ben Affleck, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. This is if you want to name this story. Many points were left connected without thinking at all. I would like to thank the Director for not explaining the points better. I say this because it means that torture will last longer. For any of Ben Affleck's failures, this failure is no exception and can only be sustained by other actors. Until then, representation for the most part was intriguing and unreasonable. A trip down the lane of memory with actors that I have not seen in years has not been worth the price of admission. All of them believe that they should be told, they are also quickly joining the ranks of "He has been." My choice was to wait to fix my car or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. In general, I would laugh at her ... because that's all I came out of.
