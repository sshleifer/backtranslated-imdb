This terrible movie does not really need to read this review. If you plan to watch it, just say - no (unless you're studying how not to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> Acting is awesome ... a serious amateur watch. During the film, I thought it was interesting that they found someone talking and resembling Michael Madsen, just to find out that it really is! New low level even for him !! <br /> <br /> The plot is awesome. People who claim to be original or good may not have seen a decent film before. Even according to Hollywood motion picture standards, this is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Do not see it !!! Go for a sprint instead - at least you will not feel you are killing yourself.
