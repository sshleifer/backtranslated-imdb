Based on the novel by Michael Chapon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh revolves around the young son of a notorious gang that spends the last summer of his teenager walking around with two friends. 1983, the young Bechstein art (John Foster) at a crossroads. Totally opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. The film looks like a director - Dodgeball was in his previous effort funny if frankly commercial - strives for Indie's credibility by combining aspects of other Indie films with sparks with stars such as Mena Suvary, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte . Like many of the famous Sundance shows this year, I felt this was a project under the auspices of a studio secret to help the director gain some independent credibility - he failed in that regard and as a film of his own.
