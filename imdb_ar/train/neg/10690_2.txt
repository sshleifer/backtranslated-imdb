I think it's possible that I have watched the worst movies, but this one is really stinky! The plot is not remarkable but this is not the worst of it. The router is not near what you expect from andy ching. He is capable of good work but has failed to bring this film together. <br /> <br /> A great harmony, playing the female role as a reporter tracking the person behind the assassination of the president, but he has already played the role. There was no chemistry with salute, her behavior was flat and fearful, and the high heels she wore throughout the film were 5 inches ridiculous. This promenade of coordination places it firmly at the bottom of the "B" list. <br /> <br /> What was he thinking cuba gooding ??? He was credited with a number of outstanding performances, but this was far less than we expected. <br /> <br /> The poor James Woods is crushing Reynolds. Poor poor poor poor.
