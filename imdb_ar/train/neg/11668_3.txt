There are beautiful landscape footage. Book put vulgar mouths in the mouths of actors. With less actors this show will be silly. "You must raise human art or it's BS." It is not because the art of all that is mentioned is also to move humanity and express the dark side. Even the leading figure says that people who do not drink slag hide the shadow side. Wrong, he lived in the dark and suppressed his dark side by drinking it and being one dimension does not expand its horizons with anything other than landscapes. There was no breathing object in his work and no expression of his pain. All the artist did was limited to a dime of landscapes. The discussions between the characters were elementary school, and the vulgar things always gave the upper personality the upper hand that the writer wanted. I tried to love it after reading all the wow comments here. I had to dig deeply to see the ones I approved. I think the great comments were those associated with the film. I was quoted only once at the end. The child was a very negative way. The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. My only opinion but do not show me.
