The fact that this film was eligible for the most successful film in the history of cinema in Switzerland makes me return! That's true, but it is pitiful at the same time. The good picture of the Swiss army may be much better. <br /> <br /> The story looks interesting, at first: Antonio Karera is forced to exempt the army from training while in the army. The church, and his wedding ceremony, Habiba Laura Moretti (Mia Egerter). <br /> <br /> Acting in a way is not really different from just a few recruits who actually fill them and throw stones. Melanie Wenger plays her role as a strong midfield Michelle Blonchi, personally found her somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> The narrative contains a comedy associated with romance, which does not work as expected. The romantic part is very trashy, and the comedic part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the entire film at all. It's funny for kids ages 12 to 13, but not for those looking for entertaining comedy. Humor is weak except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Wonderful! theft? Wonderful! If you want a suitable comedy about the Swiss RS game, make sure you have not exempted your military training yet, and even then do not expect much! <br /> <br /> I will give him 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is very funny during his show. No hell a lot of time though the screen
