Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood make a successful film attacking the Republicans? Why do not they learn? Dixie Chicks did not. These leftists live in their own elite bubble interacting with each other; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much more right than it is. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's best productions are not partisan and rarely political at all. <br /> <br /> Dan Ackroyd's imitation of Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I thought Kozak could have landed for better films. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
