This was the worst film I've ever seen in WorldFest as I got the least applause after that! I can only think of receiving this recognition based on the amount of actors known in the film. It's great to watch J.Beals but it's in the movie for just a few minutes. M.Parker is a far better representative than the allowable part. It's hard to judge the rest of the actors because the film is extremely ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore bear to watch. There is no real depth to the story. The film about the actor can not get a job, does not seem very original to me. The policeman does not develop. It sounds like one of the many direct films I saw again in the 1990s ... and not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
