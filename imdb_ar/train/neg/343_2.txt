Rosana Arquette, a real and really hard-working Canadian-Canadian actress, plays a role as a representative who brings his teenage daughter back to the definition of a "troubled child" - a few years before the "act" that killed her father and mother took him down to offspring. She now moved to the Northwest United States to start over, but her child still has a problem in being dedicated to her mother. It has in fact been dedicated to killing anyone who can be seen as a threat to their ties. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Scheffer (her daughter-in-law) is killing more people than she is - she is performing such a terrible performance that she also touches outside the film, although the script is inconsistent, the direction is useless and the music horrific Saxophone is the first time a bikini-clad device has been shown) does not help anything; it is supposed to be exciting and frightening, but it failed in both cases. (Not to mention the fact that Arkit and Shafer are not really convincing as a mother and daughter), and all the condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Brockenau, both of whom deserve more, and both (especially Rosanna) are the only reasonable reasons for anyone Sitting in this Fargo. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies "Quality International Films" - not three hours of "Love", "Lies and Murder" (of two short productions) - has a "must be kidding" credit.
