Some people seem to think it was the worst film they ever saw, and I understand where they came from, but I've already seen the worst. <br /> <br /> However, the movies I can remember (that is, those I did not block) which were worse, were so bad that they physically hurt every sense involved in watching the movie. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are movies that make you want to smash your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to prevent yourself from getting another piece of your soul torn apart from the Nakba. <br /> <br /> War games: The Dead Code is not so bad, but it is very close. Yes, I was a fan of origin, but no, I did not expect miracles from this. Let's face it, the original film was not great in the first place, but was basically just a teen love story in the 1980s, with some interesting tones. <br /> <br /> That's all you wish for, something bad, but this might be traction in my geek strings. Was that so much? Is it really not possible to do a better job than original war games, even for a live video version? Well, this seems to be a lot too. Stay away from this movie. At first it was bad, like "Oh yeah, that's bad, but I enjoy it, maybe the end will be as good as the original." Then things get worse, and in the end, trust me, you wish you did not see this movie.
