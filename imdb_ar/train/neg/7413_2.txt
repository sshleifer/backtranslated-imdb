I just finished watching, I can not say I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts very well, and the visual atmosphere gives a false feeling as this type of film should. But everything ends when a monster appears to my first Lord. Do not just recognize them from the lordi band, but they make mistakes in the film. The doomsday monsters with leather jackets and holes are in the eighties of the last century. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it begins as similar horror movies, trapped inside the pit of hell. But there is no clear story of why this is happening and what is happening. The viewer casts some lines for possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up with nothing but chaos. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an interesting start and some good effects, I thought that someone would take care of the product better. I wonder if my lord had made this film just to prove that the costumes of their show could be scary (except they were not). <br /> <br /> So, based on visual images, I think money should have gone somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by the rock band to make brutal names on stage more terrifying.
