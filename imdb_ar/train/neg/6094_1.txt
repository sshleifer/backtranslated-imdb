I was very much convinced to write this review for several reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen 2) Unless you get more reviews, it will not be on the worst movies list at all times - Which deserve to be 3) I was lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I saw him in the stores for 15 lbs. Do not pay more than this movie! You will be very angry 4) There are a lot of movies in this kind of horror that are not given a fair rating (in my opinion) and give this film a higher rating than a criminal <br /> <br /> Plot Plot: The world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone like anyone else. Our hero turns skillfully into a teenage girl and joins their gangs - sitting on the swing, and sitting baby. Kill them one by one until they are tracked down and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is this so bad? To begin representation is very bad. Another person compared it to school production. No, this is worse than any representation I have seen on the school stage. <br /> <br /> I purchased a number of these pre-banned movies from vipco to a DVD company and I was not as disappointed as I was in these. Well, the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver it in every sense of the word. What was the purpose of making this film when there is no Gore! Well, no Gore. What movie can such a show? ? No, not even any tickle! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film may have a certain charm in its unique influence but any purchaser / potential observer of this film should be advised to some degree that this film deserves at best one out of ten.
