This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it is not a comedy. One classic scene includes Kurt Thomas who just happens to find a small horse in the middle of the village square (used to destroy the bad guys). Another scene is the "Village of the Crazies." Too bad, this movie was not made a farce, or maybe got better ratings.
