Michael, a five-year-old, sees his mother running to death at the hands of his serial killer The Highwayman, who later commits suicide. "After 20 years," Mike (Gordon Corey, from PUPPET MASTER 4 & 5) invited seven of his friends to the home of his estranged ancestors "to master their own fears" at a Halloween costume. Morty, a lifelike wooden doll kept by the skilled Indian worker in the attic, possessed by the spirit of the dead father and killed by their phobia. Characters are thrown out of a window, or drowned in the toilet, eaten by mice, exploding, etc. Morty turns to my father and tree and walks around making stupid cracks. After finding a girl cut and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay at home and act cheerfully and break jokes and have sex. <br /> <br /> Good Morty and Betsy Palmer (Ms. Vorhis from the original 13th Friday are surprisingly cheerful like grandma, but this thing is meaningless and confusing than the original and full of false fears, bad character characters, dead brain and repeat footage of the last shots And the repetition of the work of the camera distorted In addition to the two minority figures (Indian girl and half black) are the first to die Blah!
