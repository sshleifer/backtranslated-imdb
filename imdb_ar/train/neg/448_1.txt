What I hate about this show is how bad the prospects are writing. These women have no respect or dignity. The whole plot is throwing themselves at men. Amanda Pines' talent is completely lost. She was fantastic in "All That" and her own show. Why they were writing to her and Jenny Garth in the form of clusters, and Joy's head, desperate, chased by men, "old maid" wishing outside my domain. <br /> <br /> Remember their plots and dialogue with the "Simpson Family" whenever his cartoon character Poochie does not appear on the screen, "Everyone Should Ask, Where's Poochie?". All talk is about whining around someone, then whining to each other. Sometimes they change it and the man grumbles instead. Then come back together or split up in the end. Both women are addicted to shallow, stupid or addicted to sex. The only word I can think of is "suck".
