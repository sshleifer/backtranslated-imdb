Let me begin by saying that I am a great admirer of imagination. However, this film is not for me. Many of the far-reaching arguments try to support the claim that the dragons may have existed at all. The film mentions links in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate them in a more comprehensive way, which could have given the film some credibility. The film (Cute!) Uses the CGI to tell us a fictional story about a young dragon's life story. This is combined with a Flash-style redirection like the TV series CSI to make it sound like a scientific thing, which is certainly not. In many cases the arguments / clues are elusive. In some cases, the clues used to show dragons may be present, fly, or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this only makes me torn. Even a fictional film needs a measure of reality, but this film does not contain it. Bottom Line: It's a documentary about fantasy, not worth watching.
