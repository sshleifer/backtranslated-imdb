I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who just rented the movie based on the look of Snoop Dogg (a passionate idol of their appearance) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the film would include a typical set of behavior and photos related to Snoop Dogg that are often seen in rap clips. However, my baptism was often wrong. Unfortunately, this movie did not make any better. <br /> <br /> Most of them described the movie as a serious dark drama, while I describe it as a dark film filled with seriousness. The film tells the story of two fanatical writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) trying to create separate masterpieces of their own. Ultimately, polar reverse lifestyles are an unexpectedly complex and nervous friendship. This friendship is transmitted through the entire film, such as the wild roller coaster - most of which contribute to Snoop - who reminds us of a person with a severe personality disorder. Although the film represents a drama, only acting - which has a satisfying and serious tone - from Snoop and the company was more comic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to those who care poorly because this one has a lot of dialogue and lots of dialogue after that. There are some modest conflicts, but they are often stymied by more dialogue. The end, suddenly jumped in my face. It has been a bit crooked, somewhat unexpected, and is a perfect way to finish a movie that needs to be finished. While watching the final credits I could only think of the director thinking, "My God, how hell ended this nap." By the way, the director has put carefully planted hints and nests that lead to their climax - all clearer than Waldo in a crowded street of pygmies wearing only black jackets.
