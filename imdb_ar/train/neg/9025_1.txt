Sorry - this movie is just a cheap television production. I've seen a lot of promotional material and I expect a professional film like "Stormriders" - what she did was a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on television. No atmosphere, very boring, much more worse fighting scenes. Some good ideas - not more. I hope I get a chance to make a movie like this and then explain how to make such a movie !!! <br /> <br /> Asian tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
