If you made a flick in the late 1980s, you had a 50/50 chance to either be underwater or in prison (unfortunately, we never wanted to flick out the prison under the water). Derek Kellor (Denise Cole), who was sentenced to death by the head of the Mafia Morti (Anthony Franciosa), was sentenced to death along with the brother of gang leader Frankie (Frank Sarsenillo Jr.). But this is less Derrick's problems as a rogue government agent (and the mobster feces) Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also runs) uses the prison as a test ground for a new super virus. This is the only Saxon flick directed during his career. For the man who worked with many managers, it seems that the only ones who got any advice from them are the cheap Italians. Sure, it's a low budget, but this can justify salary staging, shootings on arches, or clumsy presentation in the first 15 minutes. Thanks to the fact that Saxon made him very evil and works in a hilarious nude scene (leading us to sleep during prison riots just to imagine a female scientist). Cole, who looks like Michael Vincent's more rugged Jan, is respectable because the stunning lead and Franciosa - who has a really bad carpet - give him everything as the head of the vulgar mob. The end is done at Marton McKee's Bronon Canyon site. Retromedia released this on a DVD named ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
