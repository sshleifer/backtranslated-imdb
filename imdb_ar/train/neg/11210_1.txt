I read the story of John Evergham years ago in Reader's Digest magazine, and I remember thinking about a wonderful film that would result. It is likely that Michael Landon did not put his hands at all. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license exceeded the upper part, similar to the massacre of the Little House book series. Representation, because of the lack of a better word, an awful, dirty script, and there are close-ups of Landon's kitten too much to be allowed. House On The Prairie "reflects books that have been" built "on them.It is just another way to show Landons terrible poetry.
