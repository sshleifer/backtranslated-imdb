"Susan's Second Coming" is another of those surreal films that try to appear as highly sophisticated, but all she does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other films of this kind, there is limited dialogue. Everyone cares much more about visual aesthetics than photography. However, the cinema is spread so there is absolutely nothing to catch your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever made". for sure. He is there watching exciting events like a melting bucket or a turtle walking a mile. 10/01
