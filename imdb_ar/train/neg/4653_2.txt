Vampire followers want to call her after falling in love with a whore for five bucks in this horrifyingly low budget comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments on this film. I'm going to talk about collective hallucinations, but it's worrying. One of the factors of recovery (that is, I am very generous here) is the grandfather who represents the only semi-beloved figure in this whole mess. Do not waste your money, or time. In fact, here's a tip, if Troma puts it on a DVD, but it does not make it on its own, it's probably nonsense. <br /> <br /> Additions Troma DVD: Comment with Omar and Kirk; Second comment with cast and crew deleted scenes. Plots. Truma interaction. "The Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
