Bert Reynolds arrived at a stage in his career where he seemed to go to suggestions. He has appeared and a concert with his friends in the film, and get a big salary. It does not seem to him important to him that the product he represents was pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> There is no film that embodies this more than the movie "Stroker Ace" which makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Run II" looks like a riot. Except for some racing scenes, there is nothing worth watching here. Even the beautiful Lonnie Anderson gets it so bad like a dumb blonde, it's embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Bert's idea hinders Jim Navors and is dressed like a chicken that sounds funny, that's your film. Otherwise, choose almost any other comedy and it will not be worse.
