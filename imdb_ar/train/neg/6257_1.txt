SPOILERS. Curious strangers have reviewed this film. Allow me to add credit by pointing to the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Scary. Since Tom and Dan "get to know each other", he refutes the films, the talk is clearly about one person, and I think he is the director who worked his words carefully to look smart. At some point, Dan asks, "Have you heard of HIV?" It seems natural, like the question, "Have you kept up with the nine exotic races?" <br /> <br /> Representation: White teeth and sculpted faces do not perform a sensitive performance. I suppose Speedman did a good enough job, but Marcin was terrible - an unbelievable, unbelievable sympathizer and stark and dodgy throughout his life. There is a vacuum in its performance (see also Highway 60). <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: Keep me! The half-escape moments were not exciting but annoying and feeble. Marsden pretends to experiment with the keys in the door and then says: "They do not work, man!" The starting point is. Beware of the memories of the past black and white, which began with some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> Most important of all, evil, and attack, is homophobia (external or internal, which you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have taken off the condom or never used it - excuse me, where was Tom while they were having sex? There is some disillusionment with the runway partner, who is called the villain's role in homosexuals in general. <br /> <br /> In short: Beware!
