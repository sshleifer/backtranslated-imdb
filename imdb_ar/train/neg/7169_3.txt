This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, the little slave girl, Alice Harris and Garris imitate Christopher and Alan is what makes this movie amusing. Alice's smoking, drinking, and strange way when her name appears strange and fun. I must salute Jared for the tradition of Christopher Woking, Christopher and Alan to allow them to be in the film.
