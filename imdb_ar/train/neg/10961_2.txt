Although the film may have been "real" in Lewis's book (where the script was essentially a word versus a literal, literally), he failed to capture any of the greatness that was associated with epic stories like this. * Legendary Creatures (Monsters, Centaurs, Griffins, Ghouls, Ghosts) * As in the previous review, it was very difficult to swallow the green screen sequence. I almost laughed to death when I saw the human beavers wearing their giant solid suits and their back teeth. I almost cried when I heard the "Howl" wolf man wearing a mysterious suit scream loudly and loudly as possible. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very forced, especially that of little Lucy Benfense ... I could only take a lot of discontent, despair and teeth in fourteen hours of watching the movie. It seems that the actress who plays the role of "White Witch", in all her history, will be more at home on stage, where the voice is booming, spreading weapons, and brave effort in something of Shakespearean will be welcome. <br /> <br /> Groups are very concerned, whether the scenes are happening indoors or outdoors. Inside, it seems as if the BBC can not afford to spend $ 100 on a set, so they are very small, and all the characters are grouped together constantly. White Witch Castle is a rusty English rustic castle filled with Styrofoam statues and poor lighting. When Penvensie children walk through the forest - in fact, * any scene * in the forest - it seems like walking around in circles simply. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems fit in the movie is the originals, but you can bet that the BBC probably blew up the whole movie budget on the mechanical line building. It sounds great when it is fixed and before the conversation starts, but once the move starts, you can only feel pity for the poor man who must be the back end of the lion suit. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you are a fan of hardcore Narnia, you may want to watch this version, because it simply keeps every word written by Lewis at all - but Lewis was not certainly a screenwriter, and a lot of dialogue feels chunky and embarrassed when on the screen. During the scene where the children are in the beavers area and are ready to escape the wolves, Ms. Beaver continues, "Oh, just one thing, pigments, and then we'll be ready to go," with children screaming and sighing at the same time "No, Mrs. Beaver, please ! " - A scene of comic satisfaction, very disproportionate (presumed to be an imminent danger hygienist, not questioning whether the sewing machine will be packaged or not), detracts from the drama that may be the scene otherwise. In fact, the entire film permeates such programs. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, with updated effects, amazing computer animations, wonderful timing everywhere, a wonderful white witch witch (playing with every malignant evil of a seasoned politician, instead of the noisy villain) captures the greatness and splendor of the world of Narnia without detracting from the very least of Louis's vision Original (I think). Lucy has a lot of kindness (no teeth buck, YAY!), Like the beavers (and their real size), and BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, hungry versus acceptance - insecurity - and anxiety - with - New Disney. <br /> <br /> Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys wasting time by mocking camp movies, I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
