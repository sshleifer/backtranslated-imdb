How can you gather this esteemed actor from the young British actors and reach a pile of film manure? Horrible script, a hectic annoying camera, awfully liberating, acted horribly. Rhys Ifans only tries to fill his role with life. Another painful guide that "different" sometimes equals "Drake". Why does money fail to read texts in advance? Prefer yourself: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a hammer on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
