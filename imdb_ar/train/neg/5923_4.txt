During the civil war, there were many cases of divided allegiance; many of them were apparently caught in the "border states", where the north met the south by chance of geography. From the border, young father Owen Moore goes to join the Union Army. Soon after, the Confederate soldier Henry B. A former, separated from his regime, roams the enemy's property, desperate for water; he finds supplies where the daughter of the young Gladys Egan sits. When Yankee soldiers follow him, Little Gladys innocently helps hide the confederation. Later, when back to kill her father, the little girl's kindness is remembered. Sweet little story from director DW. Griffith. Site and humanitarian footage is lovingly displayed. <br /> <br /> *** In the border states (6/13/10) Griffith ~ Henry B. Walt, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
