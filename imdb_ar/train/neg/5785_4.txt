VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A Murray Brown driver is attracted to an isolated, Two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anolka), become engulfed in their passionate sexual life, but his hosts turn into vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood ... <br /> <br /> From the vampire cycle of lesbianism initiated by Jean-Roland the dissident in France , Bolstered by the success of Hammer's "Carmela" series in the UK, José Ramon LaRaz pushed the bold bold VAMPYRES to the concept of horror for adults beyond the British control watchdogs' tolerance in 1974, And to three minutes on the original British release. It's not hard to figure out why! Using his gothic theme as an excuse for many nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film will allow for a short time, LaRaz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym "De Dupine") uses these commercial elements as a backdrop for mere contemplation of life, death, Humanitarian situation. <br /> <br /> Harry Potter was filmed at Harry Potter in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, evoking this influential film atmosphere in Harry Waxman, where the abandoned countryside - dark and equally beautiful - predicts With a whirlwind of imminent terror (Larraz pulled out a similar trick earlier in the year with SYMPTOMS, a low-impact film that turns into a wave of violence during the final of the reel). However, despite its claims, the VAMPYRES wafer plot and carved production values ​​divide viewers from the start, and while the two planes are as appealing and attractive as possible, the male lead (Brown, superior to the prime minister at the time of filming) is sadly misused In a role he had to go to a beautiful lover of the 1920s. VAMPYRES is an attractive feature for movie lovers and is an amusing masterpiece for everyone. Watch out for Silent Star Age Bessy Love in a short veil at the end of the movie.
