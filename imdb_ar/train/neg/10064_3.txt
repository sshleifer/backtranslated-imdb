Pokemon movie was a terrible film. Unlike the first film, this is not a good film at all. The graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built in them. In the first one was the interaction between decent characters. Brock was putting up and adding a bad tracey. Tracey really does not have much to say or do, and unlike Brooke does not present any comic inconvenience. The only good points are that you get misty in fact getting whipped on the ash, and she was incubating early on calling her girlfriend amusing. Overall this movie is not worth the lease and the short film before did not do anything for me or my wife. We consider ourselves Pokemon fans. Well, maybe next will be better
