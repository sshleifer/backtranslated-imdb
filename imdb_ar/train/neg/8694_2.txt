The leading female actress was awful made the entire film modest. She smiled a lot when she went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect it. I would be unlikely in the same situation. She looked calm to the mother who did not find her daughter. It was as if she did not want to be even in the film. Jennifer Aniston played the best part. She would make a lot of money for such a controversial and important subject. Everyone was excellent. I do not know where the main actress is located but I hope you get some acting lessons.
