I always loved the bill because of its text and great characters, but I recently felt as if it had turned into a kind of emotional soap. If you look at promotional photos / posters for the bill now, you'll see either two officers kissing or kissing or anything related to friendships, while long-time promotional images of the bill will appear to have something to do with the crime. This proves to have changed a lot from being a spectacular detective drama to an average type of television soap. When I see him I feel like I'm watching a copy of Coronation Street police or something similar. I must say that I still love the bill because I am interested in policing and this kind of thing but I really miss the greatness that the bill is used to. I want to set it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been completely destroyed by the people who received the bill. <br /> <br /> As for texts and characters that have largely fallen back, most of the great characters are gone now (although a few of them are still I think) and I'm not saying that new characters are bad or anything because they're definitely They are not, they just lack the strong appearance, characters and text lines that all the old characters were used because most new characters are currently involved with silly relationships and family problems. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the only police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be fun and exciting to watch, but as I said, it has lost much of its uniqueness (if this is the correct dictation) and will now be classified It is a terrible and unreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended to watch a good laugh on the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
