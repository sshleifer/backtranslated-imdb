I do not think they made this film. Absolutely unnecessary. The first film was fine. But there was no need to supplement, certainly not yet a television series was already a sequel to the first film. This movie looks like a soap opera. Writing is very bad, it's quite simple. Jokes do not come across, the representation is flat, portrayed as a shadow, lacking in any direction. The first film was a good emotional spine behind it. Each character has a small arc. It was very simple but somehow successful and I can see the feature of this film. But this time, there is no coherent story line. Characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One thing is good: the Brazilian boy who plays with Axel Daeselier is very good. That was the moment of their creative success in this film. I hear that they have already filmed a second television series as a complement to "Team Spirit 2" but please, God, do not let them make a third feature ...
