... This person does not deform Bard badly. It is still a terrible production, and Uncle Hamlet of the Netherlands is inexplicably dubbed Spain (whether Ricardo Montalban or not), and Maximilian Chill is unprecedented. Most of the dialogue makes it harmless, and the fact that the MST3K version feels compelled to point out repeatedly that long speeches * duh * do not surprise me with an incredibly humorous sense. Mostly it's just bad behavior.
