Almost two people play, and as such will be important dialogue and expected performance. Not particularly good. This may be stronger, in fact, if it was first manufactured as a play for two people, then worked in the film. Stripper (result of watching a lot of porn in his home crappy). He wants to tell her about daylight. It would have been better to find someone who has a daily job, or someone who excels at drawing a picture with words like a poet, but then he may not have a hot voice. <br /> <br /> After he gets it, I do whatever he wants (which is not good at it), he intends to feed her at 6 am, and then the sun shines. Much of this deadline has been accomplished, despite the fact that he also says he can go without feeding, but will make him more hungry. In addition, he claims that the stripper can not be allowed to leave, because she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people know what he is. There are a lot of contradictions. <br /> <br /> Why do vampires choose to live in a house surrounded by the light of the street lamps and nearby buildings that flow like a day, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you think he would do a better job, or select a little place. Obviously he is not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Bloody Dance. Although it was directed by Kat Shea, and the other films I took to Kurman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were very bad.
