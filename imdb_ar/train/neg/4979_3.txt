Why can not anyone make a decent film from a mythical story? This is the second amendment to "Beowulf" which I have been disappointed with for a year. But I must say, the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", starring Gerald Butler) was much higher. This one was just a bit disappointing. This one is a mess! <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most? Were they the useless elements of the plot that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifices? Useless love?), Bad CGI, inconsistencies or impersonal representation? Worse still is the way they made the Marina Sertis look so awful !!! And lets even not talk about that silly bow? <br /> <br /> Why do they constantly remind us that Beowulf had the power of 30 men, yet there was never any sign of this force throughout the entire film. He was tossed by the monsters he fought, where he relied on the side ribs to save the bacon. Even when the arrogant prince was put out, he did not expel him. He relied heavily on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like that. This certainly was not the strong Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this in a positive way, but I can not really think of an irregularity. All I can say is, if you have read "Beowulf", you will be greatly disappointed by this dismal and inaccurate excuse for adjustment!
