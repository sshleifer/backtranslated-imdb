Depending entirely on your personal situation when you watch this, Christmas Evil can either become an ambitious and innovative psychological excitement or one of the most pathetic and thirsty items of the holidays. Personally, I tend to choose the latter because I was not bothered to do any research at all, and I simply expected to be initially in the early 1980s with a small bag in the form of Santa Claus slaying people. Error! The movie actually deals with a block named Harry Stadling. From the obsessed Christmas, he works in a garbage toy factory and considers it his responsibility to determine Christmas Eve which is worth gifts and deserves punishment. Harry's cases began when he saw Santa? His father in a clear costume? Cuddling his bare legs at an early age with tenderness. After that, he has just developed into a social outcast, infuriating his younger brother, who is sure to pick up one day (Holly). I fully understand why some admirers appreciated this little eccentric horror film, but should it have been too boring? There are many parts of the film that do not end and do not seem to do anything at all. I can forgive the paucity of time and bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or distortion of unexpected plots (except for the last exception from the end, I must admit it). Also, I would take the concept more seriously if the mad hero himself focused on punishing the rioters! It does not kill exclusively adult misconduct. How are you supposed to take the controversial wannabe and the original serious Christmas excitement when Santa does not commit a miserable child murder? This would have made "Christmas Punk" classy, ​​while it is now just a piece of oblivion and pity.
