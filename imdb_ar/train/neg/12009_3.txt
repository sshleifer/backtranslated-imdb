I had a video about the thing. I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole movie without drifting to sleep. It is slow-moving, and the idea of ​​a platform in the middle of the Atlantic, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a big decline. Apart from Conrad Fayed, the rest of the team is largely forgotten, which makes things really interesting. When the water began to leak for a long time, I woke up one time. <br /> <br /> But give the man his dues. No one can carry a cigarette like Conrad Fayed. It does not tie it between the index finger and middle fingers like young humans. He holds it in his fingers, while showing us the old brown pearl color. There are some scenes in this film, where smoke is swept into the sky against a dark background, and looks very impressive. But he does not say much about this film if all you like is tobacco smoke.
