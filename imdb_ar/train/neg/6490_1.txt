Well ... so I've seen a lot of really weird / unusual movies in my day. Fear and hatred in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think about it. Well, no longer ... From here on, whenever someone asks me, "Hey, what's the most unusual film I've ever seen?" Sleepstream is what I will say! I do not mean "extraordinary" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, it was clear that this would be one of the "triple camera effect" movies. I mean small things like flickering images on the screen, rewinding and redirecting people's words and scenes quickly, tampering with the screen, flashing ahead and the flash going on ... then you have the actual act itself. People are subjected to random violence, shooting objects / people, and saying the strangest things that do not matter much, if any, <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a writer who begins to mix real life with the book he talks about. Writing and for no better way to explain it, you basically see this "journey" that you spend throughout the film. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in fear and hate in Las Vegas but the only difference was that his trip was fun to watch, and not painful! Frankly, I had a real hard time until I finished Slipstream. It's kind of a little hurt in my mind. <br /> <br /> I can see some of the films that claim that this film has some nuances that make it not only unique, but also adds to the feeling of dementia ... etc etc. The important point is that this film hurts your mind when you see it .... It is meaningless, it takes all your focus even to try and understand what is happening remotely and even in the end, the only thing that can be happy is that it is over ... You can say that you've already sat through it! So, in conclusion, if you want to watch a movie you will be asked to say "what's the thing" over and over again both loudly and in your head, keep going forward and lose an hour and 30 minutes and check it out. > <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while praising you as an actor and praising your choice to take a stab in the output .... Please, never make a movie like this again. Next time, try something that relies more on brilliant storytelling than on camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer suffering from headaches.
