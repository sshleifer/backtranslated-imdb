The "Restriction Fee 9" is a type of film that one likes or dislikes; fortunately or not, I left it with a strong sense of lost time and that I am completely stuffed with the publicity of "bad whale killing". Aesthetically, the film could have been fun, especially the first half, until it is not clear that each movement being photographed represents a symbolic story of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it may be a little interesting to look at the everyday work of Japanese workers, but later it becomes clear that anything on the screen is propaganda, and there is no single exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film mainly uses the old moral play machine, where "good" and "bad" are not drawn in the course of action but are placed in stone. Maybe I'm just, but I find this kind of shallow and preconceived artwork, even when it comes to the noble pursuit (no irony here) for protecting the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a fundamental sin when the film material is extended without any justification, just for stretching. In my opinion, Drawing Restraint 9 could easily have been contained in 75 minutes, but its compensatory championship is 2 hours and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of them to leave gaps for 15 minutes out of nowhere without warning. The film has no standard scenario, and there is no evolution in the characters, but not the documentary, it is a kind of conceptual fixation. This is an unusual form for a film, but it can still be seen as a shroud even when the concept is as simple and na√Øve as it is here. I also think that the director had to have some honesty and did not pretend to be delivered in at least 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yes, the musical result was often like whale sounds. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
