The opening shot was the best thing in this film, because it gave you hope to see a good emotional independent film. Curse that open fire to fill me hope. As the film progressed in a slow and exciting way, my thoughts were different with respect to this "film": was there too much butter in the popcorn? Do actors have to pay for the director to be in this "film"? Was my ticket validated at the box office? Yes dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This will be the only exception I will make about watching a movie at home on a movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Were there any replacement values? Peter Lemongelli as a college "nerd" standard had his moments, especially in the dog collar. Otherwise, this "film" moved from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to spiritual elevators. Succeeded on either of these fronts. Oh, the friendly was very bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
