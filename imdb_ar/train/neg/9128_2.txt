Even if one did not realize that the sellers were in poor health at the time of filming and died before the movie show, the plot is kind to DR. FU MANCHU will be a painful display. She is presumed wicked in the famous Oriental villain of Sax Rohmer, but lacks any concentration. The possibility of sarcastic comment on the anti-Eastern tones of the Romer concept is ignored. In fact, the film uses racial insults. There are hardly any real jokes or jokes; actors often act stupidly and spread bleak lines. It is particularly sad to see Mr. Caesar forced to launch curses and racist corruption for laughter attempts. Most other actors also embarrass themselves. <br /> <br /> Then there are Peter Sellers. He plays the double roles of the villain Fu Manchu, who is trying to prepare a formula to restore his youth and his strong British enemy Naylang Smith. Vendors are not a hundred percent bad; he carries a strange warmth like Smith when he discusses his pagan association with the lawn mower as he moves quaintly as Kamanzo expresses his love for entertainment in the English music hall. But most of the time, both roles play with a wrenching mystery, leading to further vandalism of any comedic possibilities. Vendor routines, where his power is powered by electric shocks, are particularly painful; he seems to be very convulsed to be funny. <br /> <br /> This chaos can not be saved with a few real ingenious lines, which are an appropriate relief plate by Burt Kwouk (Kato in PINK PANTHER) as a Manchu follower, and Helen Mirren's musical numbers. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is a comic genius, they will not learn anything from the plot of d. Fu Manchu.
