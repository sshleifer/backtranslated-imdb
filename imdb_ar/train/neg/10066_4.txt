I have seen this again recently and there is another shorter version of 1999. I feel that the film is the same but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> Someone is Japanese and there is no short pikachu to go out. Otherwise why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy was somewhat boring. She seemed almost asleep, and there was no expression at all with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> The Collector (after Lugia, has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters are trying to stop him because trying to capture Lugia caused a lot of destruction. /> Pokemon movies followed by a little better, deoxys (Poke 7) gorgeous, none. Approximately 8 here.
