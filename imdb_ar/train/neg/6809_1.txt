One Stinko of the film includes a shop plot, and a gentler, less Oscar-like acting. But for me the worst flaw was the total misinformation of a jet plane, especially 747. Some of the blunders: 1. There is no flight engineer (or even an aeronautical engineering station) 2. F-16 F-15 (no mention at all) 3. Loading passengers in the "rear luggage compartment" are supposed to be from the cabin - even if there is such a compartment, putting so much weight in the back making it The aircraft is incontrovertible 4. The hollow bullets that "will not damage the aircraft" 5. The entire landing procedure was very bad SR-71 (for all aircraft) with the pressure seal slot 7. Open the door Subject to the outside - in the wind - on a trip !! <br /> <br /> Ah, it was just really lousy movie. List the bottom 10 of the year.
