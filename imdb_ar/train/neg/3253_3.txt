I have already seen China O'Brien II before I see China's original O'Brien. I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: the worst = fun! The funniest = the best. If you are a fan of bad movies like me, this is a great article. However, if you are looking for any kind of plot or acting ability or filmmaking skill, it is best to avoid it. The best part is how they portrayed all the fighting sequences in fast stuttering forward. Too bad. You can watch it for laughter, you can watch it for silent entertainment, but whatever you do, you can watch it for free on TV.
