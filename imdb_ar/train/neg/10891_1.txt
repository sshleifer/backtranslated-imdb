I saw the trailer for this film and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, that acting is a shame, special effects (if you can call them), looks like something will not be somewhere in a school play. Some characters are very stupid in this movie and will swing at the moment they appear on the screen, which unfortunately are often. As for the story, Vnesitha. This is a warning, do not waste any money at all in this movie, it must be one of the worst things I have ever seen. If you like watching Troll 2, for some reason, you'll enjoy it too.
