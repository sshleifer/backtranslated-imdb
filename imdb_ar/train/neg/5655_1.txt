Egyptian films contain many high-level films of drama, romance, comedy, or even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it contains nudity (full frontal nudity for females). The type of nudity is prohibited in Egyptian films .. When I saw these films I felt ... The story of a lie .. Naked actress .. Bad work .. Some colors of horror and terrible .. Dear friend .. If you want to see the wonderful Egyptian film ... Simply put : Stay away from the film "Thiab Lakhal science" .. We have wonderful films in Egypt ... We have great representatives won the universality such as: Omar Sharif or Jamil Rateb .. We have great directors Such as "Youssef Chahine" So believe me pal .. do not need to see this movie ..
