I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargaining box at my local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I had to get the five down, dump it in a toilet and go out. The film revolves around a set of 20 things that culminated in high school and the anniversary of the death of their dead friends, who were drunk, wandered through the forest and died. A problem is that the creeping monster haunts them one by one. Representation is sad, it seems that these worthless people have been exposed to offers such as 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The output was on par with a twelve-year-old boy and the script was likely to be written by thirteen years. The entire group resembles the backyard of someone in Malibu. It is clear that the people who have praised this film are friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this heap of trash at all costs.
