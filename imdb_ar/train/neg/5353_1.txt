I got a "privilege" to attend a special screening of "The Absence of Light" at a horror conference in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First, you know you're in trouble when the director makes a film, saying, "Keep in mind now, we did not have much money ..." Not that the movies do not have a bad budget, but when the director As an excuse, the results are always bad. There is no better example of this rude sleep. <br /> <br /> In fact, the first film "Absence of Light" is in the underground cinema world: it's the only time I've ever seen the kind of talented veterinarian dreams that I've already carried. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister come in and out of the film randomly and prove they are not as interested as nameless amateur names. Who are their personalities? What are they talking about or what are they talking about? who cares? Everything is boring, you will stop paying attention to anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this stress test, I dropped out of the theater and left. Not surprisingly, as did most of the team members in attendance. <br /> <br /> Any kind of weird fans would be better off. With a little luck, this movie will not see "light" today.
