Hey man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is thinner than Ross Geller of "Friends" <br /> <br /> 2) A great team (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye ) With this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The film has a terrifying speed. It jumps in a confusing and confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story is not logical. Why wants to break the football line? What about stupid violin music? None of them is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not funny. It looks like a group of accountants trying to improvise, saying, "Look! This was a bad attempt to create Love At First Bite. <br /> <br /> I love Larry Cohen's films, but the guy who failed here. The balances for the roll were terribly disappointed.
