My mother keeps a cassette tape of this film as a public threat to anyone who likes the film. Everything about it stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Did you accidentally watch a good movie and voted for this movie by mistake? <br /> <br /> All participants in the filmmaking process must be forced to watch at least one small piece of the film. It must be an indelible stain on the minds on everything that holds the sacred film and be revered as a tidal sign for tragic cinema.
