I have not read Shirley Jackson's novel, which I meant to do at some point. I'm sure it should be more terrifying than this movie. I remember jumping once when I saw him the other day, although I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and I've seen them on DVD, but I'm sure in the theater it should be a great sight. After finishing the first few effects with you are waiting for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought that this film should at least be based on the classic novel, so there should be a good story, but it was not. I landed to stare at Catherine Zeta's brilliant character throughout the film because there was nothing else to watch. Lily Tallor was a sucking character. I did not like one thing, nothing about the buzzing people. As the man in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley Dorit with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did a great job trying to get this movie kind of acting. <br /> <br /> Half to three quarters of the way I would die just to go to see a camp on Friday in the thirteenth or scream the Queen movie! At least there is a kind of entertainment value. If there is no story at least, they fill it with evil death or attractive females. This was nothing. <br /> <br />
