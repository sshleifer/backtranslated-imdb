I could not tell if this movie was too bad, or good, or, in the words of Enid Coleslaw, "It's been a very bad time, and then it's bad again." Regardless, it forced me to look in the same way that a pile of strange vomit can cause it, and it offers a number of scenes that you will not forget even if you want to. There is a young sarcastic banner Ray Leuta telling the hidden Bea that her creative cup in writing looks like a penis. A little later, there is Ray again, and he is harassing Bea, not with the cup of the right shape but the garden hose. There is a similar company Biya tells her autocratic mother that she wants to go to bed with the father of man Ray Tree, Walter. There is an actress in the cemetery scene wandering around in the best line written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYYY!" There is this garden hose again, while Walter is waving his face and yelling "Is this good for you?" There Pia and her history are running by close associates of the power of chewing each other so they started ripping each other's clothes. There is a bathing bath but forgetting to remove her clothes. Perhaps best of all, there is a typewriter for Pia, but instead of the keys, there are mini-talk heads for those who torture her the most (after that, I was afraid of opening my laptop). Finally, there is Pia in the "The Awards", which reveals Hollywood's hole, and the second best line ever, "I think I'm not the only one who has made his way to the top." I think I've actually spent more time commenting on "The Lonely Lady "More than I have done in much better pictures, so I will resign. Be careful, though once you start watching, you will probably not be able to take your eyes out of the screen until two hours of your life are gone forever.
