"Maladolescenza" has a dark fairy tale, with her children heroes, the setting of forests, and the discovery of castle ruins. However, the film in essence is an unusual psychological study of adolescents. The film opens with a dream sequence using Fabrizio's pseudo-gladiator wrestler with his threatened dog. The film explains his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl she has pledged to love, and eventually romanticizing both Sylvia and Malia. The psychological complications of the film give the film a feature, but there is no doubt about the extent to which the film is used unnecessarily in its portrayal of nudity and sex. The look of the film is based more on its brilliant locations than on the particular cinematic skill, and there is no doubt that the greatest asset in the film is the enhanced musical sound of the choir. With the exotic quality he dreams of, the film is interesting at best, but vanishes alongside the "black moon" invented by Louis Mal from Sri Lanka and magnificent of the same era. It is certainly worth discussing about art versus pornography, because unlike many banned films, such as "Salo" in Pasolini or Ken Park Larry Clark, for example, the film can not be distinguished from a technical perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its traumas, so Maladolescenza may be thought to be adamant about retaining that power 30 years after it was launched. But the value of the shock is the only reason why the film can not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The film contains defenders. Yet he does Nazism.
