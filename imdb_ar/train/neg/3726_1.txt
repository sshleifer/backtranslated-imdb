I had to watch this whole series of movies when I was a little kid and I was told it was real! Talk about child abuse. I was less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this absurdity and who want to teach their children to believe the same thing. In addition to the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also bad representation and bad book "special effects". They are just around terrible and horrible movies. Yes, a (scary) certification for the child, but I can not imagine a big purchase in this shock. Although I must say, I would be interested in seeing them today, as an adult. They may have some midnight movie / cult feel for them.
