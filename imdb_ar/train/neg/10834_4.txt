Sorry I missed something? Did you go out early? The first 10 minutes of unusual (and incorrect!) Stories drove me to think "this would be classy" but it was all down the hill from there! The acting was great, because William H Macy deserves to be great and get the best of every movie I see. I was waiting for the big moment in which all stories relate to each other and then suddenly .. It's rain frog? If the writer said, "I've deepened how I can gather all these stories together intelligently ... my God, I'll bring them on frogs." I love smart movies, I love exotic movies, but that was strange and boring. 10/04
