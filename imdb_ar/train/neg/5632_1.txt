I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the USA) and then felt it was really a really scary movie. But they should have cut off a bit of the original film, or I missed a lot. The sex scenes had a bit of vulgarity and no nudity (not even breasts), but I read many other comments on IMDb.com illustrating the vulgarity and nothing about the plug. I have never seen anything like that, just a bad and boring film with unwanted characters and a vulgar plot. Gida Colgrand is either paralyzed from the mouth or botoxed to gills, and touches her facial expression. Her name makes me think of scaling a drink at Taco Bell: "I'll have Cola Grande!" It was really fun, it was so bad, I had to play as I was in my Mystery Science Theater 3000 theater, pointing out things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big on his face. It's really like silly putty!
