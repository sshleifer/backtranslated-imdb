The original "Vanishing Point" was a big flick. Hidden motives, characters that look real and spontaneous. It was a terrible remake. Preaching, openly manifest. Missed the point why the original was classic. The black charger was wonderful, but even this could not save the light. Why stick with a white Challenger? I did not think this was the best choice in the year 71. Some parts of the film were hilariously unintentional. Such as when Figo was standing on a cliff overlooking the valley after his "dream of pursuit". His Indian friend was standing beside him. Figo was wearing only white panties. I'm sorry - it looked ridiculous - he scanned Vista in the "Noel" program. Another scene was in the end - after the explosives crashed into the bulldozers - the announcer said the impact was recorded at 180 miles per hour. Police said his remains were not found because he had evaporated, but some people thought he had been rescued and hidden by friends in the crowd. Then he shows him rolling out of the car at 180 miles per hour! First of all, you can not open the car door at 180 miles per hour. Second, the car will not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yards. With no one to guide him. It will roll around about 30 times. Third, if you hit the platform at 180 miles per hour, you end up with different spongy pieces. Regardless, we finally see him standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.
