War, Inc. - Companies are taking over the war in the future and using a single killer, John Cusack, to do their wet work against rival CEOs. Dark comedy mocks military and corporate alike. It was often difficult to know exactly what was happening. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason or way to madness. <br /> <br /> Kozak regards it as the "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. That is, the war is somewhat a knockout. We see again Kusak as a murderer who protects * the spoiler * the person who is supposed to kill him while he captures his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks kind of credible as he captures half a dozen players with relative ease. Brief battles look good. The rest of the film does not. Everything is mostly strange on exotic borders. War Inc. is not funny enough to be a spoof, so wallet so no one even thinks of anything that might be a movie message, which I suspect may be the harsh ways in which companies, such as war factions, compete and plan without looking at How it affects ordinary citizens. Interesting, but do not care about the irony because she is not funny and in her heart, the film has no heart. We are supposed to give a curse on how the war on the Cusack shell affected a personality rather than millions of war-torn lives. <br /> <br /> John Cusack performs well. His characters cut the hot sauce and lead the smallest private jet, but the quirks aim to replace personality traits. Marissa Tomey is a journalist. There really is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does not fool herself. Joan Cusack just yells wine and wigs. BLECH. Ben Kingsley may be forced to return the Academy Award if he does not begin to perform well from time to time. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you have to ask, "War, what's the point?" Nothing at all. C-
