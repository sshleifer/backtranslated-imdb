The fact that most of the budget of this supposed amount has been placed on the list of hard actors, should not be important if it has been skillfully and imaginatively displayed some sympathy for the original comic intent. Instead, we get very bad dance and singing sequences characterized by beggars and dazzling prostitutes, and the final alienation is achieved by retreat to reveal that the event has happened on stage in the music hall, which is aptly enough to produce more than Lionel "Oliver" Blair From Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good but they do not have to try very hard: Migenes at least has a wonderful voice and some feel the material. Julia looks perfect like a Mac, but she struggles with the character, imposed on her fake fake tone. Harris Peach is an awkward and poole style is terrible. The adaptations of words, texts, and music are often embarrassing: it was a bad move to put the film on a Broadway version put forward by Mark Blitzstein, but at least his words were gracious, unlike most of what was distorted in the signs of sincerity. Trying to beat the low budget by shooting horrific angles on groups shrouded in blue and orange-lit fog as if some of the lower floors of Vittorio Storaro were a complete failure - the film seemed cheap and dark and made without thinking. Disgraceful.
