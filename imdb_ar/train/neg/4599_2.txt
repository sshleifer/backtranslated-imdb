Such as "Do not judge a book from its cover", was formulated as a warning to those who fail to look under the surface. <br /> <br /> While I saw the artwork, "The Ant King" I immediately thought the horror! The mysterious images proudly displayed on the cover and back spoke of a dark vision, and the summary promised the story of murder, betrayal and revenge. Instead, what you discovered underneath this surface was less interesting than you could find under your middle rock. <br /> <br /> The "Ant King" shows Chris L. Name himself in this world, even if it meant killing. Except Sean Crawley is someone I do not care about, I never felt any sympathy or sympathy for this character. In fact, it is totally undesirable, but not like Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who is turning into an uninspiring performance, just as he made it worse through the very funny dialogue he has to read. Throwing in Carrie and Hrr as a sad widow and seemingly unconditional trust (especially in the homeless), George Windt as Duke, who is considered a solid foundation of chants but mean! <br /> <br /> There are now two exciting sequences of "hallucinations" in this film (the source of cover images) but this film has never deepened in this world. It is preferable to bombard you with uninvolved characters, bad dialogue, and an unlikely event after an unlikely event. Oh horror!
