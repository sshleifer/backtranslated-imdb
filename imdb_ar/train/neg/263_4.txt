After a day of work, I sat down to relax and run movie channels. The film appeared on the guide and looked fun, so I caught it before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of representation in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to wake up and find food during the film. If there is any credit to be presented in this film, you should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie fun. All in all, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this tenant as a tenant for a movie night.
