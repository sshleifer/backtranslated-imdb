I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw movie or 12 Angry Men (people collect facts to get the truth). However, it has been poorly implemented and not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I do not watch films of blood and calm, but since this film had nothing else, the actual killing should have been more than. Most of them were outside the camera, reducing the horror that was supposed to be felt by the deaths. <br /> <br /> It was also reported that the policeman was among the victims; he inadvertently contributed to the innocent young man's going to prison by accepting evidence planted (presented by MJH) to the evidence room. (MJH prosecution lawyers will not be able to access that evidence - take it out and return the wrong evidence - anyway, so you did not need the help of the policeman?). While others often do not realize that this particular person was hurting him, they are still playing bigger roles in his final demise. A gun dealer must know that his weapons will be used for an evil purpose. The insurance man had clearly rejected a person in need, etc., but the policeman's crime seemed minor compared to what he did not know exactly what he was doing. Directors could have taken a step forward and encouraged MJH to sow evidence, which would have made him more vulnerable to guilt. The screams of MJH that he (the cop) make it into that mess make no sense at all. <br /> <br /> It would be more interesting if everyone died in a way that gave others an idea of ​​why he / she was there and deserved to die. For example, the insurance man could get the requests he rejected, suffocating them; suffocating them; it was possible that the eastern woman had denounced her eyes because she was a false witness, and so on. Yes, more violent than that shotgun, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not brilliant, there were no twists, and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I had ever seen. The end ended with three stars for my appreciation. <br /> <br /> The actors did a good job, especially in light of the garbage lines and the motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> In general, a waste of time.
