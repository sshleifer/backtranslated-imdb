Because "cruel" will be the only word that exists to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do I start? At the beginning of b * tchiness, I will start with the terrible representation of almost everyone in this film. Scratch it. Almost does not belong in this sentence. I can not even think of one character being filmed well. Despite fairness, it will be almost impossible to portray these zero-dimensional characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Kathryn (whose name was not intentionally included - I pretend to be non-existent) is still one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but she's been silenced by the man who played Sebastien. The story was awesome God. I have tried to reflect the ingenuity that was first but failed in many ways. To a large extent every part of it was useless - although I will admit (reluctantly) that the twist of the plot was very good. The end was at least humorous. But this movie is there with the worst I've ever seen. Do not see it. just no. No value at all to watch it. nothing. It only takes the first enjoyment.
