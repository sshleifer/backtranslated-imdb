Devil's experience: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies are divided into two categories: those that resemble plot (Gee is born lucky pizza) and those who do not have (amateur anal 36). Satan's experience is firmly in the latter category. <br /> <br /> It is of course a horror version of the porn hardcore. The whole plot is almost less than 43 minutes for the money. He was filmed in a video in 1985 and consists of three relatively unnamed Japan boys who torture a pretty unattractive Japanese girl. The usual between the blows (slapping 50 times, kicking out a hundred), ridiculous (tied to an office chair and spinning around), fear factor (bath of worms and sheep's courage) and finally a silver shot. (A eyeball carried out well). <br /> <br /> That's it, not a plot or a motive, just the shots of Blair's charming tree and torture. The girl looks bored, and except for the scream, "No Spanish Inquisition is expected" during the office chair scene, I was bored. Stun a bolt on the screen, waiting for money shot. Just like hardcore porn.
