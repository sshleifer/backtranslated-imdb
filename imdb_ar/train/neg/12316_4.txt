Director Jonathan Lin has made some comedies in the past, such as "greed" and "idea." This is not one of them. Closer to the movie "Police Academy" than his inspiration, starring Steve Martin as the old Phil Silvers as an army captain who forever pulls tricks under the nose of his superiors. But the ideal life of Pelco and his slow squad seems shaky when he visits an old enemy base designed to capture Belko in action. Nothing happens too much, really. Everything is very boring. This is not very funny. Martin, Dan Ackroyd and Phil Hartman press some laughter through sheer effort, but they are all better than this and it is very painful to watch them working with such fine materials.
