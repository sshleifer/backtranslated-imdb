Julia Steeles is a talented young actress who enjoys the guidance of an agent with a good reputation. It is clear that the person who led her in this farce is not the person who cares about anything in her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left their cars in search of another film to sneak into wondering who thinks this film would be attractive to anyone. It was badly written, and the director of output could make an effort for a minute or two in the characters and obviously the director did not care.
