This version is likely to be available in your local currency store on a DVD. Printing is not great, no sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes or so to spare it, you get the value of your money (which does not mean a lot of terrible things). Anna Nigel is very vapid as Nanette. No matter how enchanted they may be back in the day, they are not clear in this film. A large number of representatives of the beautiful characters appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is significantly less than their talents. However, it is interesting to see how these artists benefit from weak writing. The musical numbers (there are already only two) are extremely awful. It is obvious that the studio did not feel compelled to take advantage of the rich music originally "No, No, Nanette". For what it is worth, you can get a DVD for $ 1.00. It's worth a lot to just say you've seen it.
