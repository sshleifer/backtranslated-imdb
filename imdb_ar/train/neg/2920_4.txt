Wonderful! I was shocked when I learned that he was a small scientist and that we were all connected. It takes 88 minutes. John Dunn put it so much better in one sentence. "No man island." The acting was not bad. The children gave everything they had but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow it and ended up being the only real "hero" in the film in prison after being tortured by a meter maid. I do not know, I do not know. I just do not get it. Oh, okay.
