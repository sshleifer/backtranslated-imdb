Yes, I will tell you this, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this one with an evil Christmas title. There was also another horror on Christmas on a DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While a silent night, a bloody night (not to be confused with a silent night, a deadly night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, it was not a good night. It started to be interesting enough to see the villain (if you can call him) watching neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and cute, but after a moment you are looking for some action this movie does not offer. You need to develop a personality, but this is still impossible and you are not absolutely sure why the man stopped. Nearly three people are killed every four hours, while a whole crowd is watched in horror, and the people who kill them are not even his targets, they only mock him. This is one of many failed attempts by the killer to hit the naughty. He then tries to kill this other man and tries to storm his house by pressing the fireplace. He immediately stumbled and barely managed to get out. He then enters the basement and then tries to kill the man by choking him in his bedroom. He does not seem to kill the man this way until he grabs a star from the tree and cuts off the throat. What the heck was a tree so do in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yeah, the killer stopped before this concert and enjoyed it too. Well, except for the people who chase him with the torches and the part that has not yet been resolved with his brother and that tone he wants to play. What was that even about? He has been talking about something that has not really been explained. How does the question that I have asked end, well since he told me the spoilers. Running on the road in his truck and heading to, well let's just say it's lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
