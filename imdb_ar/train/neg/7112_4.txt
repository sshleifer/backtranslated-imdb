Well, I have to admit that this was one of my favorites as a kid when I used to watch it on a home projector as a Super-8. Now there is not much to recommend, apart from the value inherent in the camp for the "terrifying" actors of replicas of human skulls. The special effects are pretty silly, mostly composed of skulls on the wires and overlapping "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But there is something that can be said for groups. The large palace in which it happens is very creepy, especially since it is mostly uncluttered (perhaps because of budget reasons?). <br /> <br /> It certainly inspires more laughter than screaming. Just try not to get the laugh when the wife (who does more than her share in the yelling) goes to the greenhouse and faces the ghost of her ex-husband.
