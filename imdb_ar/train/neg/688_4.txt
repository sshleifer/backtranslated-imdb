I have always loved Fred McMurray, and although her career has ended tragically? I think Carol Lombard is a fun viewing. Combine these two major and catchy stars together, add the best supporting players like Jean Dickson, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamor and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic text, and team up with leading director Michelle Lessen and get a modest film experience. <br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "met gently" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks in love. Skid is a great trumpet player, so he begins a musical journey, which can be predicted in both its rise and fall. As he ascended into musical stardom, Maggie neglected, who later inspired him to start again after he had reached the bottom. Ah, yes, it's the end of the real happy Hollywood, which does not come very soon. <br /> <br /> The stars and director of this game must ensure success, but this film is predictable and slow to the point that it is difficult to watch at times. The early scenes identified in Panama are so complex that they seem to last forever, and then the snowboarding game in New York goes on indefinitely. Fred and Carol are doing their best, but the tired scenario and the direction of S-L-O-W do not give them a chance. Even the last scene, in which Maggie Skid is encouraged to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, does not seem true. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie once to see some of the early performances of MacMurray and Lombard. However, I guarantee that it will take about 48 hours to see.
