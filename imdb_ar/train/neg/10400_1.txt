Enough ... Sometimes they just need to stop making films based on the concept of dead long ago. The first movie was a big shake. The second was ridiculous. The third was nausea. The TV series was so bad. This film leads to a deeper share. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and brides, we now have the chain in the Wild West, in the 19th century, fighting gerboid. Like the first rework, they must learn how to overcome them again. I am mildly amused. Otherwise this direct release to the video, just like the 2 and 3 tremors, goes a long way. I still wonder how there is no record of these events ... Have you forgotten the simple recording of this unprecedented event? I think something like this will be made of history, so our friends in the first film will not be very prepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this destroy the original make me crazy. Avoid this litter.
