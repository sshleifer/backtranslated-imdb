Well .... I only have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheesy! The only advantage to redeem this movie is Dean Cain. Otherwise - it's a CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some hope in the concept - an underground laboratory that creates a real flag that breathes fire - essentially gives us more encounters of the "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great possibilities, but they do not They follow .... Special decent effects - Although you know the Dragon is a CGI, it does not look terrible like CGI .... <br /> <br /> I did not blame Dean Keane (although he was a producer) But I blame Philip Roth - the director and writer. It is the task of making this film .... Unfortunately, it failed.
