This is a humorous and lame attempt to hipness. Script, demonic dialogue and really embarrassing representation. Really the worst movie I have ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this film from being a complete disaster. I saw her when she went out to a cinema in Brighton. People were coming out and there were people talking outside the toilets more than the hall! In the end, there was mockery and ridicule from the small crowd that was left, which was very sad when the relatives of one of the main actors were present and seemed really shy. However, the film was so bad that I did not really feel this sympathy with them. Everyone must start somewhere and start their son out of acting through this truly horrible "Tarantinism Made in the UK". It has been 5 years, but sometimes I still remember the sad night in the movies! This film without replacement features at all! I gave it 1 as 0 is not available. They must invent an "illumination scale" for all participants in this unfortunate mess of film. I know some of them moved to better things, and the positive thing is that none of them could sink any less.
