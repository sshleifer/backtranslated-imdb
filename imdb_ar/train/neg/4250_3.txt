It's like what other Dracula movies always do, the disciples of Dracula always next to Dracula, and that's what disappointed me in the end. Regardless of the person's desire to stay vampire or not, I would like to see something in the first film that fights the client against her master. It's interesting (you can almost predict how the story will go) more than just winning the priest or D.
