I do not understand why making replicates has become a trend. Every new edition I have seen is appalling, and this is no exception. If one of you has seen the quote from Ben Jones, it is a "flabby" piece of trash, it is quite right. Why did not they take a great TV show, I loved it, they did not miss any episode, they have seasons 1-4 on the DVD, and I'll never know it. The television show was a family program, and although Daisy had the body, he was actually pampered, or even dealt with in the show, but he was saving the clothes. A family show was turned into a dirty piece of garbage, and I would not recommend anyone to go see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider, Tom and Tubat were excellent actors (along with the rest of the original actors), and they were very nice. The new Bo and Luke are not cute. It was one of the drawers of the exhibition. Casting is terrible. Maybe they got at least a brunette brunette. I do not think that Bert Reynolds is the boss boss Boss Hug. Every other role he has ever played is exactly the opposite of this role. The only role they played in the middle of the road is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it is still unacceptable. The Denver Pyle is a representative of himself, making him ideal for this role. I think this movie is awesome, the story is awful, and all of it destroyed a wonderful show and turned it into a bad and terrible film. I would not recommend anyone going to see it. I just saw it out of curiosity, in addition to having a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I never paid for this film, but it was free. Do not pay to see this movie.
