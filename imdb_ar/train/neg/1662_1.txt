This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This makes running a TV movie mill like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the author and only Britney Spears and her mother, this is a trash can with nothing unreasonable about the performance of Virginia Madsen (I hope you have earned good salaries) to save it. The story of the red-necked rural gills, which won a scholarship at a prestigious music school, is only a way to steer Mrs. Spears into consumer music and to generally agree that the low eyebrow should be the way. There is nothing good happening here with all the tunes that can be predicted like the night the next day. Never again.
