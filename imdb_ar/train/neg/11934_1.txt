I sat in almost one episode of this series and could not take it anymore. I felt as if I had already seen dozens of episodes, then hit me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard that joke on Seinfeld, and I saw someone fall like this on friends, and the episode of Happy Days almost had the same story. No interesting actors here too! Some were good in other programs (not here), and others were new to the profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stinky!
