If this book remains faithful to the book, then we can assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony never died of his wounds obtained in battle as described. Matt died of cowardly suicide and even then, asked his slave to do so for him. The slave chose to kill himself instead. In the real story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the courage of the great slave and decided to copy it. But even in the case of death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed suicide attempt. He cried for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. I have drained his litter on the ropes and Mark Anthony died later. If you want the date you do not see this movie. If you want to lead a romantic, you will probably enjoy it!
