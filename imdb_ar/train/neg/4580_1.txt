I still try to decide whether this is indeed the worst film I've ever seen - the most troubling problem with this film is interviewing real scientists, but their footage has been edited to make it look like it supports the ideas of many BSers who fill this movie. The average bachelor's degree in reference to interviews is between ten thousand and one - in the end, the people interviewed seem to say, "We want you to think !!" , But they are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel open-minded and want to expand your consciousness, please be open enough to read some actual books about Quantum Theory: The World of Einstein, Nigel Calder (little size, not challenging) "By Heinz Biles. If you can not bring yourself to read a book, please do not complain to the reviewers about "openness." <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film is incredibly bad. <br /> You know what a really good movie is wondering about the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor," directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Birko, Gretchen Mall and Vincent Donovrio. Smart, exciting and thought-provoking.
