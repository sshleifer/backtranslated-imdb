Julia (Christina Copeland) travels with her husband Stephen Harris (Stephen Mann) and their baby son Alex to spend two days with her family on Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple expect to solve their problems along the weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Stephen meet two strange men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Peyzer) arrives, he explains that a family of Hilbili residents lives on the island. Peter rushes in a pot while driving the truck at night and the front lamp turns off to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he is believed to have collided with an animal. Later, the Savage family asks Alex to make up for their missing son. The Yong family does not accept this trade and is embarking on a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget film, with a stupid script, and an amateur cinematography but acting surprisingly. The flawed story is absolutely silly, and there are many incredible situations. For example, how can two men leave two women with a child alone on the road during the night with a distorted family threat? The logical procedure would be to immediately go to the continent and bring the police force to save Peter. Then the young family disappears. Julia and Stephen leave their car on the continent, home and friends, and no one haunts them? Peter calls his sister Julia from Alex when he arrived with the boat at first. There are so many flaws in this flick that I can spend many lines writing about it. I think this film was filmed with a very horrible home video camera. Good cast worthy of the best material to work. My four vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("The Island of Blood")
