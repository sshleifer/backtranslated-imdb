When I first saw a glimpse of this film, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing Lucille Paul. Photography by Rachel Yorky Lucy is very awesome. Lucille Paul was an amazing comedy and incredible talent. Thinking of a legend like the portrayal of Lucille Ball the way it was in the film is appalling. I can not believe all the actresses in the world who could play Lucy better. The producers decided to get Rachel York. You may be well represented in other roles but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It's very hard to find someone who can look like a Lucille Ball game, but at least you can find someone who is somewhat alike in appearance and talent. If you notice the portrayal of York Lucy in I Love Lucy rings like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, there is nothing like it in any way - its expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To top it all, Danny played Pino Daisy and Arnaz is terrible. Pino does not qualify to play Ricky's role. He is small and slim, his tone is unrealistic, and again, his actions are incredible. Although Fred and Ethyl were not the same, they were not as bad as Lucy and Reiki. If people want to understand the real state of life in Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A & E's biography of Lucy and Desi, reading the book from Lucille Ball herself, or the American master of PBS: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a dramatic document, "Before You Laugh" will be a better choice. The portrayal of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before Laughter" is much better than this. At least, a similar side is displayed instead of nothing.
