I enjoy the quality of quality, and this ranks first with some of the best. CG is out of this world, or at least precedes our world, the insanity of a 6-foot bloke in a rat group chasing after very bad people. I enjoyed some of this, but the acting was so terrible, and even the obligatory bare scene has nothing to do with it. Just a complete waste of time if you see one. I do not know who wasted more time, or watched it, or the poor who were dragged to make it with little hope that this would start their career by proxy. I can assure you, it will not. However, in a brighter note, I was able to successfully get a score of 6 degrees from Kevin Bacon from this film, so I think it was worth watching a 91 minute film almost.
