I happened to like this show, with millions of others. So I caught this movie, thinking if it was not good, it might be great and at least enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Error! I just wonder, at the end of this, were Charlie's angels really boring? I do not seem to remember it that way. But this film, as bad as films of this kind, is little like the excitement of that period of time and presentation. I saw everything, despite the negatives, it was not impossible. But it was very nice, as I do not mistake the performance of artists at all, especially women who played the angels as if they were already like them. The film was not interesting. I tried to make each angel "personal". (One angel is the brawler, the other is the "good girl", the other is for her husband ....), all characters were filmed with one main characteristic that identifies them with little depth beyond stereotypes. The excitement in the show was missing and the dialog box was .... dialog box. This is pretty much. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not worse than TV movies. But can not be missed.
