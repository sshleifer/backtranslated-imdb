A wonderful TV series completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to pass herself off as a 16-year-old income! No exaggeration - this is the actual age of the character played by McGraw when the film begins before the sudden attack on Pearl Harbor. These mini-TV series are in fact the most classic example of the title of this publication and one I refer to whenever the subject appears. <br /> <br /> This alone makes it completely inaccessible, although it is one of the best international television drama films filmed in World War II. If you have the stomach - or the ability to quickly go back - you may be able to enjoy the late President Robert Mitchum with a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at some of the comments that point to the love story (intended pun intended). Have they seen the film with their eyes closed? Or are they older people who have not succeeded in astonishing them with "selective memories" and "selective vision". I pomer myself so do not think for a second I am a young punk fanatic. 45 will always look 45. get used to it. Treat. The new Curse is graceful. <br /> <br /> The winds of war could be ... very good. To what extent will we talk about this mini-series today, after about 25 years, has creative creativity been created in this important and decisive role? At the moment, with the old, reckless distraction, this alone eliminates most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war.
