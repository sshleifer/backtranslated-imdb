As is often the case, the impressive and bursting trailers of Asian films add only faint stories. Like Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story in which men breed ferocious wild dogs that carry out their master's bidding. The main characters, an inexperienced assassin, meet an equally unstable police officer, far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose the path you are supposed to sympathize with, and you do not even feel the slightest affection for either of the two men ?? Whether that is the director's failure or perhaps the basic message he was trying to tell, you are left to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was full of intrigues and unpredictability, only half way point it slipped into a wet story to stay and retaliate. The thrill that was evident at the beginning soon disappeared due to a largely unmatched musical degree resulting in an effective narrative. In the end, I left the feeling that all the detailed background information and thinking of the main characters was somewhat unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, was the transition from point A to point B very anomaly compared to American films? So those who are not familiar with Asian movies and who are tired of predictability of Hollywood should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance appeared in most of the movie. It was like looking at a picture taken on a fluorescent when it was supposed to be tuned to a tungsten. I may be the only one, but my eyes strain. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the movie also play tricks on you? He gave me an interesting accumulation of hope in the story of the slow motion until it was converted into a low-speed chase budget. And only when you think you'll get an unresolved independence that ends with a mixture of Shakespeare's tragedy, you realize that it's not an end at all, but a transition to the mysterious country music montage about peace and serenity. <br /> <br /> In some horrific choking scenes, the moment of redemption unexpectedly returned to brutality and returned again in the other direction. The Asians grappled with physical fluids and the terrible musical result that did not match the film, and got an average Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why every fighting scene was covered with sections of busy black? In the end, in the end, are we reminded of the real murderer who is still waiting for us? Tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
