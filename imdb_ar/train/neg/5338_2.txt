Elvis Presley plays an "original prince" ("an Indian") who has to defend his reservation from great businessmen. Everyone likes to drown, fight, and make children. Fighting, wrestling, and "beating" replace each other with the word "how"? <br /> <br /> Although he has makeup, it is clear that Elvis is healthier than what appeared in previous films. Perhaps, he was preparing his famous "return". It was not possible that this script for this movie is anything you should be passionate about. Joan Blondell, who is trying to seduce Elvis, and Bourges Meredith, should be ashamed of "War Painting". <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (in fact, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is the love song Elvis to the bull "Dominique". There are some surreal scenes, but they will not be triple enough to succeed in this genre; although "Stay Away, Joe" may provide some laughter if you are in a "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
