I'll make this short and sweet .... I've sucked this movie !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched Part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest movies ever, I've given it 9 movies of 10 stars. So I thought that Part 2 and 3 would be a good supplement, I was wrong. This film was so boring to death that it was completely different from the first. The plot continued and this happened. It was like bad abuse from the first part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was very happy to have Glenn Danzig in this film, but do not exaggerate that you will miss him. There was a whole bunch of nerdy actors and people I did not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Bills. Yet Ethan Imbri was his breath, one of the most entertaining people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you like the first movie a little less, so do not watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, because you are impressed with Part 1. I will wait a few days before watching Part 3 and pray to God to be better than this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with Lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever seen in the film. Quickly advance or skip to that if you can not prepare the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 stars - this was bad!
