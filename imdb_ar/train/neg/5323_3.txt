I can not believe that in the previous 34 comments, no one has mentioned that this film is a blatant film about Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring a seemingly dumb blonde up to the gangs' requirements. Hired a rifle and a blonde in love and live happily ever after. Gangs in the left. But Born Yesterday was a smart treatment while this was just a big fluff. Moving Technicolor to DVD is sad. Natalie Calmus will roll around in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize it? But, historically interesting to see the roots of rock and roll. It is also interesting to introduce Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
