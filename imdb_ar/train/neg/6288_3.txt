After reading many of the comments here, it struck me that no one recognized this as a long-term remake of the 1960 Twilight Zone episode entitled "Portrait", starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating a scary and effective story within 24 minutes of Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this tedious napping. The short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained end, but in a feature film, there must be a little more core and the story should be logical. Unfortunately, essence and feeling are two things missing from the "broken". Yes, there are some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some Additional Notes: Although it is clearly a contemporary story, there is not one character in the movie with a mobile phone! Although a car accident is the event that occurs in the story, there is no reference to an insurance company or to the person driving the other vehicle or to the police who had to report. My advice: Skip this cavity and watch the original text instead!
