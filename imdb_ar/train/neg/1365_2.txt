The legal gray area concept in Love Crimes contributes about 10% of the film's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to it being grossly bad. To say that Sean Young's performance as a lawyer called what is rocky is very low. Through her soft suits and over-hairy hair, Young does a good job of convincing the public of sincere hatred for men. Why do you ask her only friend to be a whore so she can catch the police trying to pick them up? This hatred is also the only reason behind her pursuit of the relentless photographer who gives women the thrill, consonance and driving force behind this crazy film. Watching "Young" as she moves from the extreme outdoors to full nudity does not give much attention, but her tantrums beside the fire by the lake do nothing. Her raucous views of her self-hatred and sexual frustration make "love crimes" worth the rent, but it's all down to and from there. Despite her desire to bring Patrick Burgin's character to justice, her police skills evade her in the midst of her passion and tired passion. Patrick Bergen is doing decent enough work as an abnormal social meeting. If you succeed in sleeping with the enemy it is certain that hell can work in this. But I can not help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy Yong brings to the film runs against its thickening. I think it happens and the result is an "exciting story" with excitement that is so bad and yet comedic.
