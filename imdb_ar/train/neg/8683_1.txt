This offer is not smart. This is essentially what it epitomizes in. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to avoid to avoid the full bite of the rest of the bush in the world is unfair. In another comment, someone quotes hilarious lines. The highlight for me was George H.W. Bush told the children that they were not supposed to watch any TV alongside Fox News. Wonderful. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line represents a high point for this series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with the Dril game is such a sad excuse for political gossip that these people get the second season. I am a liberal Republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this is no excuse for putting down this waste of time. I put these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind "Know Sparta". Their formula is to squeeze as many of the usual topical jokes as you can, and you can throw even worse original materials to actually give yourself written credit. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Not funny, this makes me more and more dissatisfied with the renewal of this nonsense, but amazing and original performances such as Arrested Development are presented after 3 solid seasons. Please do not see this nonsense, unless you are one of those liberal green hippies who think that any phrase in Bush's words and stupidity is comedic. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All he does is simulate a little Texas accent, and exhaling strongly at the end of the strings. At least South Park admits that sounds are not accurate. If you want a political satire, see Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, as the motion animation stops very well. Look for George Bush as a serious on YouTube. Priceless
