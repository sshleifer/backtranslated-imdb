!!!! Possible MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> While I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN I could not believe he was made in 1993 because he played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid-eighties begins with murder and leaves the audience to reveal "Is he guilty or innocent and goes To sleep with his lawyer? " , But in the middle of the film shows his credentials in the early 1990s by switching to "a lawyer gets manipulated and chased by her" client "ending in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has a more absurd end in this regard. <br /> < br /> This is a very bad thriller but it's the most memorable thing about it being directed by Sydney Lumitt the same guy who brought us a classic courtroom drama all the time 12 ANGRY MEN
