With these people forging a lot of footage, using old shots, and killing with gas to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a set created with actors, what do you believe? The old film of nations is beautiful, but animal abuse and degradation is painful to see in these films. I know that racism is fine in these old movies, but there is a lot to make this couple lose credibility. Martin Johnson, who was portrayed as a pilot, never lifted his planes, was a former employee, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while he was paying royalties, and deprived them of obvious depression for his wife, using them as gentle support. Unbearable. They were not the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. He was okay as a director and photographer, but that's all.
