Do not get me wrong, Dan Yansen was a skater very quickly. If someone is worth the Olympic gold medal, he is Dan. <br /> <br /> But how could Bill Korcoran make a bad film about the amazing story of Dan Janssen, because this is the real story of Dan Jansen really incredible! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman, everything is wrong, the way that Matt Kesslar and other actors, skating, their style, oval dimensions skateboarding, all this is a mistake! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corkouran, Dan Jansen deserves the best, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
