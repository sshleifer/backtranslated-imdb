One may think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hoon and John Cleese, the film should be, at least, fit. These stars (especially Martin and Kelly) have produced some of the most comical works of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems I was blatantly wrong - it's one of the worst movies I have seen so far. Baffled in my mind how one joke-by-another can be very wrong. I was annoyed to see these talented actors performing one of the most lame, positive texts I have ever had. Based on the big names only, I remained upbeat for a long time during the film, but she always failed to entertain at all. <br /> <br /> Normally, with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and generalizations. But with this film, it is difficult not to retreat. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, the major Hollywood productions that have left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedy movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this --- I really did. But in the end the town's inhabitants failed miserably. If you really want time-saving entertainment, just take your money and watch it spin as you wash it in the toilet. Just please do not watch this movie.
