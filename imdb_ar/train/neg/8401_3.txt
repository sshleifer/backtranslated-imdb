After I've just seen this on TMC, it's new in my opinion. It is clear that although the stars are outstanding stars, they do not actually run the show. First, they were divided into two groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of homeless, so there is not much teamwork complete. The story of love that feeds the plot is not interesting. The two sisters are the only ones who have any ability to act, and there is another group of uncharacteristic musicians, unless they think of their ridiculous attempts to be upset, unfortunately. The music is exhausting, they drive cars to the farm and then they rely on horses, while the dark western fabrication is silly, and there are a lot of amazing movies that do not have any camera tools on the camera. By the way, this is obvious after Carly's first stroke, and the low power level has a clear. Vernon Dent appears early in an unsupported role. I loved everything that these guys did, including all things not related to Curley, but this little dog is very poor.
