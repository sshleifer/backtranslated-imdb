This film makes Canadians and British idiots idiots. The men are stoned / drunk, then screaming / beating each other in almost every scene. Women are not necessary for the story ?? I do not understand what is there ?? They spend every scene causing the melee, or worse, in the milling like a lush cattle. Apparently, Canadian women either have vulgar traps or huge hippies. She is the standard close friend and her losing boyfriend and ridiculing his evil mother that we have seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is a violent stereotype. Not to mention they all looked like they needed a shower! And the idea of ​​what kind of scene involves having sex with George Windt? Chills ?? Enough to make anyone a gag! I watched the film because Samuel West was in it? But I do not understand why he accepted such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracy is a wonderful actor - the only one who has a vague recovery moment, but his talent is lost here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot ?? The three followers are trying to recover their anesthetic ?? Yawning - Carl's mother? Who died, but who is actually a largely lively figure in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? Although I am ashamed of even thinking of comparing these two films), why even bother? Carl is so angry that you find the circumstances of his death satisfactory. <br /> <br /> With the end of this miserable movie, I thought they were all going to be better off to go with him on this boat!
