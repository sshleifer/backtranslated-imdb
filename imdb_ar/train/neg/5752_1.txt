I do not usually comment, but there are things to say. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Acting, by Jeremy London was terrible! I did not think it could be so bad. The plot could have been good, if it had been well directed, along with the strong performance of the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of the movies you read about and you think it has great potential for entertainment, but you were disappointed at first. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I laughed well. I will not waste my time if you are.
