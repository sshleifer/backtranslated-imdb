After the already disappointing "final dispute", the series reached the bottom with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film attempted (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while this film simply rephrases and copies the ideas of "Omen" (animals afraid of the Antichrist, the death of one man very much like the death of a cameraman in the first film). But what seemed exciting and creative there seems stupid just here. The little girl looks simply like a spoiled child.
