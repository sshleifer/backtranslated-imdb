The film is really unpleasant. While the special effects of Rick Baker are very impressive (if they are in the stomach), they do not have other recovery features. Like many of the 1970s films, it makes you feel as if you need a long shower, cleaning your own mud. The characters are uniformly unpleasant, the plot meaningless.
