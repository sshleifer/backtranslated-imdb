How the hell did they do this? The stunning "$", which represents itself as a huge comedy, represents two fundamental hours of mumbling in the fragments of the sentence. Warren Beatty, who is usually unreliable, appears to be drunk, while Goldie Hawn, a cheerleader, usually acts as a depressant. As for Grote Frob, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was more impressive than his character here. Not even a person carrying a champagne bottle of LSD can save a series of this worthless. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this film to Plan 9 of Outer Space? I would not do anything like that even if someone paid me. P9FOS was made stupid but ended up. This has been done in a stupid way and leads to the feeling that your mind has just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they took part in the "Shampoo" tournament, but then took part in the dreadful Town & Country. Maybe they should not be involved in films. All in all, I'd better tear up my skin instead of seeing it again. Horrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should redraft it with Jackie Chan. Then I pay to see it.
