Although two years have passed, I still remember the complete loss that includes the whole plot. Unfortunately, I encountered this film after my friends and chose it while reviewing new releases in Blockbuster. We decided to choose the film because it was the only film we did not see and it seemed to be fun. Although it has been some time since I saw the film, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, no real conspiracy), and a complete waste of time spent watching the movie. If you are in the video store and have acquired this movie, continue to find the best movie. If you end up watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
