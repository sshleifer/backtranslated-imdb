In this botulism-driven paranoia, the protagonist fights our obstructionist authorities, double-action co-workers, and exposing the Mauzi UFO dissidents, and silent foreigners who infiltrate. (Although it is able to control objects and launch them from afar, but it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about twenty buttons). The script interacts from one event to another, leaving many puzzles. Why blind foreign dog? Why do soldiers roam with radiation when patrolling an empty landing site only? And what space is worth the cheese on the moon kidnapped the ugly photographer first rather than his model? Ask the minds you want to know! It is clear that the writer and director Mario Garizo discussed his subject by scaling a stack of tabloids labeled UFO while filming for the dual Sunn Classics feature. (The process of crawling on the closing screen boasts that it is based on actual events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel annoyed by the abrupt conclusion, but still have to attract plots.
