Stefan is x-con five years ago and marries Mary. Their marriage was stable until Stefan stepped past him and offered him the post of courier. Stefan's job is to deliver heroin from Germany to Sweden, which has to go easily. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stephan meets with Eli, a Bosnian girl sold to a nightclub owner. Stephan hates what he sees and decides to help Eli out of her misery. This is due to the fact that Eli's father during the war had traveled to Sweden. Eli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up for the past, Stefan Ellie promised to help her find her father, no matter what it took. Finally in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan had thought before. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film does not fit the ordinary Swedish film category because of the fact that it has been converted into a lot of America. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergkvist make it mediocre, and their effects make the film too much. See it and jugde yourself. <br /> <br />
