Hey hee hee. This film is so bad that it does not try to hide the fact that it absorbs a lot of time. I remember the day I first saw the MST. The sun was shining, looked good day. After that, I saw this product from Rick Sloan which consists of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the land of the eighties festivals. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, persuading his girlfriend, the management of the assistant security guard function, tries to fight with rake, a lot of things in this series of images too bad. No plot or story is needed. It is clear that acting is not necessary as the film proves. A man of the army and his crazy sex girl will make you jump over a cliff, and your budding buddy will make you say: "He got a nice red shorts, and I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his own supermarket Only when you think it's over, wait until you see Club Scum, ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I recommend you after watching this movie, which is a good month to restore senses and rationality.If you see Rick Sloan, Thigh to show how much we appreciate this alien piece called Hobgoblins.
