They did not make mistakes in writing characters, not only absorbed sounds, not only for writers who seriously need to get girlfriends, not only really rough graphics, but apparently it was created mainly for ages 1-6. The only episode I ever saw in this show that I kept watching was "Family Story", because I loved Robin's character. Sometimes I think it's just a general version of Batman The Animated Series. For example: At BTAS, Bruce is considered a friend of Harvey Dent, yes? During the story of two episodes, he turns into a possible villain, TwoFace. In the "show" Bruce is friends with this guy Ethan, and on the story of two episodes, turns into a potential villain ClayFace. This was just a small example (may not be true), but in short, this is the worst attempt in the Batman series. That's something to say.
