Apparently, the man of mutilation revolves around a man walking around the earth and making presentations of self-mutilation as a way to overcome his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because without listening to a comment by director Andy Cobb (which was not available to me) or reading the film before watching it, viewers will have no idea what is going on around it. Viewers and fans of extreme films may be tempted to watch The Mutilation Man with a promise of some harsh scenes from live and disturbing footage, but unless they are also fascinated by the lead-in, the experimental cinema at Dar Al-Fan, they will find that This film really makes it hard to sit in it. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of horrifying images accompanied by non-musical voice, awful music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind awesomeness awful drive is the perfect way to test a person's safety: if you still get all your marble, Stop this trash and watch something decent instead (I've seen everything, but I know I've just sailed!).
