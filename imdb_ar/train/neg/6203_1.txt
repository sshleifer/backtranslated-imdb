I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every cliche and imagination of a violent boy was shown, you just knew how you would end up with all the shots of the chef's wife and raping the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the Q & A with the director / writer and writer / producer they tried to come across as thinkers, but you can say that they are violent. I bet on anything that abounds in brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to keep my friend from coming out of it.
