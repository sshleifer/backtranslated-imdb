If you hit your head with a shovel, write the text with your feet. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gang clicks and done better. Those who believe that "Scarface" was somehow a hero to be seen or seen as "Goodfellas" or "Menace II Society" or "Presidents Presidents" and MMM thought "This is life for me!" I will love this movie. I thought I would give the film a chance, because the hypothesis was ideal for progress. I should have known better after seeing Mario van Peebles and Sean Combs. Anyone above grade 4 education, see the original text with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
