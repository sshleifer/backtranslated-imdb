I am a fan of Jean Harlow, because it was a quality star. I do not think her films are good and I do not think she was a good actress, but she certainly was fantastic in comedy movies. Every part of the comedy in The Girl of Missouri is very good. But this film is probably like a love story. Jean Harlow is awesome in this game and you can forget the rest of the actors - their performance brings nothing new. I always like to think that the beautiful body of Harlow was the body of a sick woman. Well, this movie looks pretty.
