I watched this movie late last night, and usually if I'm late, I forgive the movies. Although I tried, I was not able to view this film at all, but it kept getting worse as the film continued. Although I know it's supposed to be a comedy but I did not find it very funny. It was also an unrealistic picture, a bit of rural life. If this is what anyone in your rural life thinks, it certainly is not. I have to agree that some of the cast members were nice, but the Frenchman was really fake. I must agree that he tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one over the age of 8 watching it, it's very annoying.
