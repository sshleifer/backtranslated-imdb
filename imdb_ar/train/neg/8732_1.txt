The plot revolves around the death of young children. The hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the film he seems to have some problems with his daughter. In the end the serial killer is captured. This is. But before you discover who does not need to see some terrible behavior by all representatives it is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Huber. I could go on like this but this wastes a lot of my time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
