In the last 10 years, I have worked in 3 different independent wrestling institutions in Indy, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on two different programs of wrestling television, and voted and commented on several DVD wrestling . I have never seen the level of outspoken amateur stupidity, lack of talent, skill and poor quality of production in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. So listing this as a wrestling video of any kind is a clear abuse of the term. He was filmed with low-dollar video cameras, mainly home videos for children playing in backyards. Sound quality is bad, video quality is bad, the representation is appalling. The "wrestlers" wear temporary costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks, beating each other with a variety of elements and mimicking wrestling in the middle of the road. Sometimes "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on the backyard trampoline. Everyone behaved badly and were carried out with no shameless skill of wrestling. In short, do not care about this stink. Whether you are interested in this DVD is entertainment or academic (in my case), you will be very disappointed.
