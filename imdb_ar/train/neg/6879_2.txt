Rosie wasted a lot of TV time in talking about Tainos as if she were very influential in the dynamics of the modern Puerto Rican era. they were not. The truth is that Africans and Spaniards knew and knew it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen looking like a light-skinned black chick (with a clear black father and cousins) that pretends to really recognize the real essence of what makes them modern Puerto Ricans, but barely mentions how Africans influenced the way he speaks Spanish, And music. She is very typical and has lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Also, since she wants to dance about her African character, she does not need to do more roles associated with Black (Lackawanna Blues). We can find Black Latina proud next time (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> To Puerto Rican here they said they are African and not "black". ...Thank you so much. We "blacks" certainly do not have anything in common with "you" so there is no lost love. However, since you are likely to be in the states and benefited from the civil rights movement, we would like you to reject any decent humane treatment that you received with blood, sweat and tears from the appearance of the "blacks" who do not share them. <br /> <br /> If you are right, the Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media likes to exploit the low points and behaviors of all minorities to preserve reckless generalizations. However, you obviously have been fed by the noise that you are white or somewhat superior ... you are not. Also, you feel somehow forced to believe that the black culture is BET ... once again you are wrong and you need to spend a holiday outside the cover. Try visiting Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, NC. Believe me, none of these blacks want to claim your "culture."
