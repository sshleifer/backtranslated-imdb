I tried to watch this hated film when I was five years old. I have not been the same since. This film, "full of works full of drug-laden images filled with the rubble common to your average asylum seeker, despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially children. <br /> <br /> Begin with enough innocence with a poor boy His cock drowns his colleague through (waiting) putting his head through him; yes, put his head through him But do not be afraid, my friends! He soon suffered a fine flute, which is strange enough, I will give you, but still acceptable. > <br /> THEN: The movie turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are, but loses all the "warm and mysterious" aspects of either book. <br /> <br /> So This 7-year-old Barney's yellow boat endorses this poor boy and engulfs him more in despair. To add to the nice collection of horrific themes, add a meat boat, once a friend of the glamorous rafting crew of the Grandfather's "The dragons," to the mix of chaos. <br /> <br /> The most comfortable picture in the midst of this chaos is the villain who is called "Witchiepoo" (?) Of course, it has its own problems: What makes a clear plastic mask Expressions of the need to deal with the broom stick, whose gas level has always been at its lowest level It is not appropriate. As a result, one of her favorite diversions was to dive into the water body that separates the land of Pufnstuf from her decomposed, decomposed house (I do not know where I would prefer to live). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is awesome ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects on its audience like Exorcist, this movie is for you. Enjoy.
