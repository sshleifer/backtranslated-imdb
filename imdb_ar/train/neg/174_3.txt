* Potential spoiler * <br /> <br /> "Back to the cabin next to the lake" is a useless film. The acting was not good and the plot was not remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> "Cabin by the Lake" is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Good Nelson was good in the first film and put his characters in his group even more. It seemed as if he was not interested in the work of the sequel. His behavior was good but he could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the actors because in my opinion it is not worth mentioning. But I will. Alison's character barely appears in the first part of the film. Suddenly it became the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role was not logical and should have been thought better. Dalia Salem was very terrible. Her behavior was less than adequate and the people chosen should have looked for someone else and anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confusing figure. He seemed to have a goal of being there, but his death did not seem necessary. It was a good role playing, and it was not a great thing; it was better than Salem's. Stanley, who is presumed dead, is making his way to the film "Cabin by the Lake," a scenario-based film. He stumbled on the director and in a short time, the director died while Stanley ran the show. Yes, from anywhere else the crew will only allow this stranger to enter the picture and finish the film without knowing anything about him. There are some killings, not in their entirety, and the killings that are presented are ridiculous. One of the actors in the group is exposed to electric shock while shooting a scene. Another character is chewed by an automatic boat. One is entangled in a factory before drowning. It must be difficult for these writers to stir up. <br /> <br /> I just want to say that I was not impressed with the film. The way in which he changed from looking at the low-to-normal budget began to get angry. Also, the new cabin was built next to the bad lake. We did not show it but only in a few sights, everything with the basement chain was useless. We succeeded in the first film only because we offered the room much more, but did not succeed in this film. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All but a few have no reason to be there. The representation of what was showing was a bit really bad and ... they had no purpose in this film. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Back to Cabin by the Lake" is a sequel game from where you first stopped off. "Cabin on the lake" I can take but this was not impressive. Good Nelson should have avoided this as well as you should. Nothing like the first and went very slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour and continued in the clouds for the second hour. Not to mention the writing was awful. Put this only if you need some help to sleep. <br /> <br /> So, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way, it seems that there could be a third premium possible for a good movie on its own. Quit throwing rebounds and we may be fine! <br /> <br /> (Did the filmmakers realize that they made it clear to us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first? They were all done in a tank, never revealing the secrets of photography.) <br /> <br />
