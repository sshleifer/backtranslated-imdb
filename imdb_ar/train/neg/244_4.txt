Henry's silent one-page cartoon comes to the Fleischer Studios, which is described as "the most extreme human being in the world" in this tiny little cartoon. Betty, who has long since passed the production code, runs a pet store and leaves Henry in office for too long - five minutes. Hole or cavity.
