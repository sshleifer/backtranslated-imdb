My brother loves this show, let's continue with this. I fully agree with the people who said they were copying from Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I have never liked strange parents to some extent, I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it was quite annoying and not nice at all. This is the same way I feel about testing Johnny. Except, nothing makes me laugh at this show. Gags are very stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe I only, but children do not wear like this! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is wonderful, but that's great! <br /> <br /> The Dexter plant, which was one of my favorites, I still do not mind seeing it. Which makes me feel disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Tony's making an absolute joke of this wonderful show! <br /> <br /> Something else. The. dog. he is. And therefore. Annoying. It's louder than Johnny! A gay accent? What nonsense! I hate the dog to death, I hope to die, because it would be better for the children to see than listen and watch the hateful crap that continue in this show, pick up the gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your temples to burn in a miracle flame and your brain is fried from this show, do not see it!
