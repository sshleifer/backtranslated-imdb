This movie was rented by a friend. Their selection is usually good. I read the cover first and I expect a good film. Although it was a horror film. What I do better. But the horror did not come to mind while watching the film. It was boring, it was not a very entertaining movie. Dennis Richards' appearance was once more delightful to the eye. But that's it. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> We are very disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> control it yourself.
