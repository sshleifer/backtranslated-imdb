Except people seem to buy in this garbage! Programs such as "Moral Orel" have shown, even if you tried to make you the most parody of evangelization you might come close to. It's hard to know what's going on even when you see it. Is it a news show? Talk show? Who do you know !? These reports begin to report many world news, but at seemingly random points this news has been interrupted by this strange little man who looks like a dwarf with his head bigger than his entire face, and he wiggles, laughs and becomes a creep in general. <br /> <br /> Pat Robertson does not seem like such a bad guy at first sight. It looks like just a dementia, but an old harmless dementia stuck in his old beliefs (like most of our ancestors). But this is the man who called for his assassination, who became his friend and did not help anyone, but two murderous dictators, who used illegal donation funds to operate diamond mines, who supported forced abortions in China, which regularly indicates that Caucasians (particularly Caucasian Americans) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, it will all be funny, but it seems to have a large enough base to keep its small display 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some executives) TV who do not give what they offer). The folly of the exhibition becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, should see it and relate to every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he was, people still listened to him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I think a healthy combination of both.
