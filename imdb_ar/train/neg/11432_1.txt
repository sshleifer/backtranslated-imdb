I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to perform this unbelievable scenario for five hours (or whatever the time was really long). From the beginning, each element of this film can not be believed. This film made me laugh a few times, but they were basically shocked because the director / writer actually expected us to believe many of the chaotic elements that tried to bring this film together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Gray (Graham) and her issues with Intimacy. Things become interesting when you realize that she and her brother have unexpectedly many things in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, interesting. However, instead of revealing this story to something believable and desirable, the director continues to take Gray in these ridiculous twists that have no meaning at all. As a homosexual, this film seemed to echo what all two different sexes believed in the exit process. (I would be a fan if it was a writer writer). If it were not for the nice chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was forced to understand), I would give it 3 negative stars.
