How to earn this 6.7 movie rating is beyond belief. Not worth anything better than version 2.0, and obviously it should be rated among the worst 100 films for IMDb at all. The National Treasure is an insult to the national intelligence, which is just another attack on Hollywood on American audiences. Critics have reported gaps in the plot by which you can drive a 16-wheeled car. <br /> <br /> I like the justifications of this film for being good ... "Nicolas Cage is nice." Come on people, no wonder that people all over the world believe that Americans are stupid. This movie must be the most stupid and insulting film I've ever seen. If you want to watch a really decent movie this season, think of Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, the National Treasure got more publicity than those great films. I bet that most of you read this unheard of, because some have not yet been widely released. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is a wonderful actor - when he's in the right movies. Time after time I've seen Cage squandering his wonderful talent in horrible horror movies like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is used as well as Charlie Kaufman, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - I'd better feed my hand on a wood chopping machine instead of being subjected to this visual horror again.
