I jumped into the opportunity to watch this movie without intersection and without interruption, remembering rahs and raving for it. But wherever it seemed really scary, she went back and went somewhere else. Drops of water all over the house, black rain, prophetic dreams, were dropped with the wrong turn in the raw sewage before they can even work screaming. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's mask for the semi-expressive face did not offer much of the infidelity but confusion, something I found myself wearing in the film. What could have been an indigenous hymn chanting musical instruments in the background was instead a cliche apparently designed to strike terrorism in the head. Ideas that can be embodied by contemporary people are ancient gods, in which indigenous peoples believe that white men with red hair were the first priests, and many other possibilities were passed on to the form of a shopping list more than just a hint at another dimension (the time of dreams). [SPOILER] In the final scene, it was not clear to me what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So what? How much size? The tsunami? Yeah okay. This is devastating but not the end of the world. Is it the end of the world? Of wave? The last wave? Must be a large wave of darn. why? Was the world bad? Does not sound awful in this film. In fact, I did not think the wave was launched, because the shadow left Burton's face that was thrown by the wave. Burton was just the end of the world? This happens every day to the people who lost it. It was not important if he was himself. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene, the scene that gives the best signal on the potential of Ware, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton went to meet the old man to scare Burton's wife. Charlie continues to ask "Who are you?" It becomes really annoying after a while. Unfortunately, the film did not follow anything.
