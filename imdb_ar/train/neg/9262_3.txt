On the roof was a good 4 omen idea. It is nice to see that the devil child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the case of evil spirits, when girls are owned or demon, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it was difficult. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think she can be a satanic child, but a troubled child. Issues that maybe only the therapist, instead can help the priest. It does not look scary or demonic. Instead, look ambiguous and temperamental. <br /> <br /> This film had potential and if it was produced by the same people who made the previous three films it worked. But it is really important to insult the creation of a supplement to one of the most treasured horror trio, as a private television maker. <br /> <br /> On many levels, it fails. It's cheap-looking, and the representation is hammish and typical effects of TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and do not direct them. I recently saw him after someone brought me for Christmas and was a historian. <br /> <br /> If you think about watching it, I suggest you do not watch it. Watch one of the others, or witness the evil spirits repellent, or witness the good son. Just do not waste your time on this drivel!
