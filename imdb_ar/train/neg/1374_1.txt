Man, this was hilarious. It must be under COMEDY. Or stupid. It would have made achieving what a pile of this stank was much easier. seriously? I want anyone to relate this film in an effective way right away. For anyone who thinks of watching this "movie", let's go to a few points. Uh wait. There is not any. There is literally no conspiracy. I think Casper van den was bored and decided to film something with some random characters, miraculously, one way or another appeared on video. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me go watch it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be prepared to tie your eyes. If you can sit without blowing a cow, you are strong and very courageous.
