This is a very nice and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant plays. I can only guess that the intention is to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has never been exposed to Shakespeare. By doing this - with each line clearly made and every intention clear - they drained the game of life into a flat caricature. Somehow, it's actually boring - a very difficult achievement due to such wonderful materials. <br /> <br /> Representation Forgetting at Best - Sam Waterstone as Pendik and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not fare well. April Shawnham Champion is a maniac, breathless airhead who often excites winning. Jerry Meyer Don John is a senseless cartoon character at the Snidely Whiplash level (although Snidley was more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (as you know, the person who murdered Mozart?) was not in this version, unless he was disguised and his name was removed from credit. <br /> <br /> Since the product, Joseph Papp, is essentially a theatrical god, this production is not only disappointing but also scratched the head. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this. See Branagh's Much Ado instead - his novel is full of vitality and humor, so he does not say anything about great performances.
