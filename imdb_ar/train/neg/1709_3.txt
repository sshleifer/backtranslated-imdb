I got myself a copy of this film I thought was a 1964 movie with "Zombie Bloodbath" as an alternative title. On the contrary, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the above title; which may mean that the other is really bad! This film is very bad. Obviously you can not get into a movie called Zombie Bloodbath. You expect to see a masterpiece, and in fairness, you live up to the title level with a large amount of appearance ... but it seems to be very old and tired, Who was not helped by the terrible and stupid conspiracy line. It is just an average nuclear spill that makes people turn into zombies and so on. The movie starts sequentially and people see it withering which lets you know what you want; low-quality zombie litter. There are a lot of movies in the film, a really good job, otherwise the film would be really boring. The Zombie Bloodbath game looks very cheap too, and has been clearly gathered by inexperienced filmmakers! The main effect seemed to be the dead day of Romero, although it could actually be about anything that contains zombie and gore. All this boils down to a predictable and meaningless end, and generally I can not say I was impressed by it!
