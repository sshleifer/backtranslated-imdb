My teacher recorded it and showed it to us in childcare to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. It just showed how a teenage pregnancy affects a childish Jock who does not learn properly about how to have sex for a petty little girl who pays off when she gets angry and can not say she was with the wrong guy even if he wore a sign saying he was. Would not be surprised if the child's father has about eight girlfriends in the first version of the script. Stacey (the baby carrier) is a riot. She is oblivious to the fact that her daughter has passed the age of four and appears to be unshakable when people spy on her through her dining room window. Bobby (father) his best friend is Dewey, and clearly breaks Sean Penn's character in the Fast Times at Redmount High. This movie is grotesque, because it simply can not believe any of the characters. Thank God, it is only made for television, which limits the chances of the public watching it.
