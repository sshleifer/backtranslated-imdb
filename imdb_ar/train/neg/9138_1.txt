Worst film ever, this is a statement that people often cast on IMDb tags. Whether it's Uwe Boll, bad classics such as Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest summer festival of director roles from Michael Bay, people often jump to the sudden conclusion that they are on board saying there is nothing worse in the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> I envy these people, because they are ignorant of happiness and do not realize how deep the rabbit hole is in the making of comics. There are movies there too bad, very hateful, unintentionally funny and so ironic that communities around them are formed to celebrate their names and their discussion boards are the nicest places on the Internet because everyone agrees that the film is so bad. <br /> <br /> Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ben and Arthur, an 85-minute gay epic so bad that it's very much like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can not stop looking at it. From the brainchild of the "Hollywood actor, director," I would add Pisces to the beach Sam Mraovich, this movie is awesome. Let me give you a hint of how successful this project is. Mr. Marovic did not only direct this film, but also wrote, produced, edited, prepared and edited it and finally starred in the film. This man is too blind to himself, and his belief in his lack of genius, like a person with an ugly child, is not quite aware of the calamity of his creation. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails on an epic level, the representation is the worst ever seen, the plot is the most absurd, editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even music is like a nail on a blackboard. I am aware that I passed a bit of the shadow here, but please believe me that this movie is really bad as I describe it, I would say that this film is a huge nonsense that was crushed in a reel film, but the truth is not even filmed in the film, Digital video is not much better than the ones in your closet that now collect dust. Do not get me wrong, you've forgiven the low budgets for movies provided that the concept is interesting, for example as much as I did not like, Blair's witch project proved that low budgets can lead to an interesting film in the atmosphere. Ben and Arthur do not have a good idea to refer to, even if this film was filmed with a $ 20 million budget with the best Hollywood actors, it is still insistent, and the plot is that awful, and the characters are worse. One of the main characters portrayed by Arthur Samy Samovich is poisonous and one of the most abhorrent little atrocities ever put into film. You will not like it within 5 minutes of the beginning of the film and by the end of the film that will turn hatred into direct hatred. It is clear that Mr. Marovic has forgotten that we are supposed to have the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the joy of intruding you'll see to watch this movie (which I urge you not to pay for) so I'll give you two mild examples of how stupid this film is, and tame and moderate, like the mistakes Least disturbing in the film. In one clip we hear one of the main characters say how "they know well and they will give him a call" fade away and then fade away again and this HIM they talked about previously is actually a woman, a very big mistake making post-production I think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transgender lawyer, the characters are asked to fly to Vermont, and then we take a shot of a plane landing among palm trees in a sunny area. I never went to Vermont personally, but I'm sure you will not find any palm trees there. <br /> <br /> Imagine this kind of stupid amateur incompatibility that lasted for about an hour and a half with an ironic dialogue and was drawn and then hit in 10 and still will not fully prepare you for Laban and Arthur. Imagine that the worst movie I have ever seen in your life and imagine it is worse and will not be the same level as Ben and Arthur, this movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> However we should be happy in some way, such rare real movies. They give us hope that one day we will become filmmakers or be screenwriters. Simply because we will have a new feeling that has been found with confidence because of the fact that we will know that there is nothing to produce no matter how amateurish the ability to overcome such a celebration. <br /> <br /> The real movie has finally been discovered worst of all time, called Ben and Arthur.
