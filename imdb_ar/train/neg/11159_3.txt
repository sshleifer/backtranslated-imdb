I have watched this film in "Infiltration Preview" and I must frankly admit that I do not like movies with Merrill Streep so much. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater is not back after the mid-movie break. I could not blame them. If this is not a true story, there will be no need for the second half of the picture. Just before the movie went on about 10 years ago, I was expecting the credits to appear myself.
