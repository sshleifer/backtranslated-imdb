Some movies have left me with this uneasy feeling, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw her in the theater (how ended up there I can not help but wonder) I was exposed to 90 million of hateful and derivative trash, the main impression was like this other film "Do not answer the phone" - but what's worse. It shows all this narrowness, rape and everything, without any distance (unlike strong things like "another house on the left") and the absolute contempt for the victims (ideal?) And all concerned, leaving the viewer treated as a sadistic voyeur. In the end I felt a shower. No credits for the manager
