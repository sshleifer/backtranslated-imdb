I do not think I was fooled by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as I did when I came out of this strange film. Nothing is logical. None of them are intelligent or thoughtful. Because there are no really suspicious moments, they use this over-the-counter trick once you build the music before the character does something like opening the door or pushing the curtain aside and there's nothing there. Maybe this was good once, but I came back three times. There are things that were put forward for no apparent reason, characters, and lines of story unfinished ... characters were not well developed at all. The end was bad. Bad, bad, bad, everything, every element, in this movie is terrible. I am here only to warn you of all of this.
