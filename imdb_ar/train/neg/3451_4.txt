Frank Sinatra was away from the ideal actor for westerners. He was a wonderful actor, from here to eternity and the golden-armed man proof of that, but he did not have the fitness of a western hero, I knew him as an urban man. But he tried to do his job well at Johnny Kunshu, the fact that the film failed at the box office was not his fault. I blame her for two factors: a) The story was very unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra acts like a villain rather than a hero in the film. In this genre where people expect a certain pattern, the film must be very good to get out of it. B) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that an entire town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they fear his brother. And also when he shows him a private purse will open side so as not to paint the gun wondering if that will make him invincible, why not adopted by all men of arms? I think this movie should not be withdrawn, because any movie with Sinatra is worth watching, and despite its shortcomings, it is still fun
