"I'm curious: yellow" is an evaporative evaporation pile. It does not matter what the political person's views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that male nudity is NC-17, this is not true. I've seen R movies with male nudity. Granted, they offer only some fleeting views, but where are the films that have been rated in R with the intermittent vulva and the two small labia? Anywhere, because they do not exist. The same applies to those crazy cable shows: Schlongs swings in the breeze but not the clitoris in sight. And those independent films such as The Brown Bunny, where we dealt with the Vincent Gallo flickering Johnson, but not a visual effect on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implicitly) "double standards" in matters of nudity, one mind must take into account a clear and unavoidable anatomical difference between men and women: no genitalia are present when the actress is naked for a man. In fact, female genitalia in an American film will generally not see anything less than explicit pornography or erotica. This so-called double standard is less than the double criterion of the dismal ability recognized to reconcile with the inner cultures of women's bodies.
