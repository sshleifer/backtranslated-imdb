Almost sank in the cheese watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want to recover my money. One of Hollywood's weakest tries to come up with a new idea. Something good and I keep a bowl of lemon in the fridge. just in case. They should have given Nick Cage a hat and bull whip. Swashbucklin. Cage's performance in raising Arizona or leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". This movie should love people who are fully or completely marketed (mostly). If this movie has been moved, I would have taken it more seriously. I would have preferred to see a completely stupid film that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid film, and it made an incredibly sad attempt to try to hide this reality. <br /> <br /> Every SHEEP seems to love it.
