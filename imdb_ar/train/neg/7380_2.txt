I think its time for Sigal to go quietly at night. What I've just seen makes all of its direct releases to video releases in the past few years look like smashing in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> The Secret Bioscientist is making a new type of medication that jumps the human adrenaline system to the point of becoming mentally retarded killers or something. Somehow SIGAL is supposed to stop infection or end it in the world ... or something. Seagal passed through successful teams such as jellybeans, every time I look at them, he was driving a new face, so it was rather difficult to follow the evolution of personality. I know that Athsma in Steven prevents him from screaming at the top of his lungs, but even so why was he called Consistently by people who do not seem something like him? Usually, the film plot and its rescue sequence can save it from a complete waste of time, but it was not soon. As I said, it was more of a horror movie with lots of blood and leg to stab instead of direct combat. The problem was that it was not really scary, and Segal seemed totally misplaced because the injured people were supposed to have a slight speed of movement after 40-year-old Siegal, 40, killed them all individually. I think the highlight of the film was the first 20 minutes in which new recruits from Seagal were asked to attend the induction club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
