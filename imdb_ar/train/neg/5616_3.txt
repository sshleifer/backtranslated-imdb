This will be short. Let me first mention that I am not an atheist and not totally crazy about the Xtians, especially the Xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone like some angry teenagers from his mother xtian for not allowing him to play video games. I just can not take it seriously. Reminding how Charles Manson thought that Christ was to clarify the point at which he could generate evil xtianity? I do not know she was cheap and boyish - she made the opposition look ignorant. Moreover, the narrator seemed just arrogant and tanned. Delivery was a complete exaggeration. I can not take this documentary seriously. An angry teenager may like to leave his mother Xtian for not allowing him to play video games.
