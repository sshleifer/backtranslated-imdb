Overall performance: - Finally, AAG awaited the long-awaited screens. Unfortunately, you can not ignite a gradual fire in the audience. The first thing better to talk about the film is the idea of ​​reshaping the powerful SHOLAY. And Pharma has taken a nice choice to change the overall background of the film. If you repeat the same wallpaper as Ramghad, people will say again that there is nothing new in this. Different background is appreciated but the way it is presented is not worthy. Since the beginning of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he used the same lighting and background type. I do not know this guy seriously about lighting or not or may not have other lighting technology unlike gordon willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why some body use a lot of Dutch corners and extreme closeup shots !!!!!!! Lame fire division. The characters can not bear the emotion, the performances are not their fingerprints, the worst storytelling, the background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabh was given priority over his job. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Malik Bhai but this time failed to carve the best characters all the time from Indian cinema. There is no comparison between Jabbar and Babban. Babban is more of myself and not a villain, he still has a soft angle for his brother (it's a gift in this film). Amitabhz's performance is not on his mark. His appearance is pathetic. A scar on his nose, symbolizing the forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What they did on Babban did not work. Babban does not compare with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first thing better about this character is not to put the audience in suspense around his hands. If you do that varma, it would be like teaching an ABCD to a BA holder. Good Itz open the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Pharma was unable to use a great actor like Muhanalal to label his character. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character was improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - Do not bother anyone or at least consider this character. The complete failure of the film begins when the director can not work on the close friendship between our heroes. These characters do not carry anything for this film. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading and demeaning. AAG completely can be treated as a film degree C. Sholay is the fire of revenge, a problem in the city, the meaning of true friendship and discomfort and fun by Darmendra. AAG did not carry passion with her characters. Storytelling is so weak that it can not make the public feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with sholay, however you will not want it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
