I heard that many of the stories about this movie are awesome ... well, I took my chance when I saw it at a cheap price in Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I saw him, and I have some comments just about this: <br /> <br /> 1) A terrible story line, 2) Terrible representation, 3) Bad fighting scenes ... <br /> < I have not seen any worst movie in my life so far !! When the story is bad, you have to make the fights more interesting at least. But both are very bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing in this film (in my opinion) is Nicky Berwick. God, looks beautiful in this film. <br /> <br /> That's all ...
