This is an interesting idea went bad. The hidden meanings of art that have been left as clues written by a serial killer seem intriguing, but the execution at Anamorf is very slow and without any interest. There is no other way to describe the film except boring. Death guides are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that binds them is boring. Willem Dafoe offers reliable performance as an investigator, but has nothing to do with extended text writing. Many supporting actors, including Peter Sturmar as a technical expert, James Riporn, the police chief, and Paul Lazar as a medical examiner, most notably Deborah Harry, who appeared on the back of a DVD box are missing couple lines speaking through the cracked door. Not recommended. - Merck
