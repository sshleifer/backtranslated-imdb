Well, the film is ironic. Very slanted film, too stupid. <br /> <br /> We've got your typical teens at home doing something. We got an FBI agent who was seen Dirty Harry once too much. "So what is the secret ... the bad guys?" We got about 4 different shots for the camera and the scene was meaningless at all. "Man, I'm fixing the sprinklers" ((That guy was my favorite part of the film)) Suddenly, there is a preacher confined to a couch watching home movies, being killed. <br /> <br /> Follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, with no cops. Suddenly she is in the church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear that this is the most stupid film I have ever seen.
