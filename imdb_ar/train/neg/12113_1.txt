Townies is the most lazy movie I have ever seen, and I saw Blair's charming films (Parts I and II). He seems confused by what he wants. Not funny enough for comedy, not tragic enough for drama, not bloody enough for horror, it is not good enough to watch. Contains scenes of a man who is karate "grotesque / bloody" so I think, this film will be in the context of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. He then jumped without warning to a play about a lost girl, a backward woman (a mental handicap) and an insightful mother. Then collides with himself in only the good part of the film that seems to have been prepared like a sitcom without laughter tracks. The part that I'm talking about is the lonely TOWNIE who is lonely and finds comfort in a rotting body. This was the only part of the film that gave me any feeling. The rest was short in my life. After that, only to show how Wayne CRUEL type of documents at the end of the film Wayne (director) makes fun of Toby (star) in public places. He made me ill. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other directed by Wayne) are not the best, they think at least enough that you can stay until the credits expire. So I like Killer Nerd a bit, I had some wonderful fonts that I still use to this day. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are underground, if you like movies above the ground, and if you want to watch your feet, just rest were, you will not love TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (outside ****) <br /> <br />
