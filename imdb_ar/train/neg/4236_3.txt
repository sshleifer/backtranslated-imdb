Well, if you love pop / punk, punk, sika, and a bit of modern psychic music, seeing live shows revolves around the only thing worth seeing. This film includes tons and tons of magnetic models, along with the head of Troma, and Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-master, and many horrific scenes of death. Sounds like it might be good, right? Well, deaths are still coming, frequently for many different teams of warp tour and fans in the event. Some deaths begin with elegance, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of total repetition. Almost everyone dies because their head is broken or the intestines are pulled out of their stomachs. This jar looks like it was from the movie "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas. With "blood of water", but now this film is really fit, and gives you a cheerful spirit that this film lacks terribly. The film is certainly made by Doug Sakman of Troma, and has got great potential with a low budget and tries ... but it is very hard. Everything is overly funny in this film, and that's what it explains. Everything tries to be comedy and idiot, through the use of deliberate bad behavior, excessive use of useless deaths, and do the same ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker," or "Chairman," or any movie you've created with your friends: It's funny to those who made it, and that's great. <br /> <br /> Fantastic potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same ... over and over again: band playing, die band, die the crowd. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, this process is repeated. <br /> <br /> Question about these types of movies - which are basically a "bad bad slap" - are they trying hard, or not trying at all?
