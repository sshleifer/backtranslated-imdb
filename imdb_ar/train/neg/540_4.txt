ALL FOR LOVE is a romantic drama featuring Captain St Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army who was captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he met and falls in love with a young virgin who visits the prison. There is also a story involving murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and admit that I did not take it in the film because I am not a fan of dramas that go back a while, and the film scenario is somewhat accidental but I will say that this is behaving well by all involved and it contains A good actor includes Miranda Richardson, Anna Freil, Richard E. Grant, Michael Goff and Jason Isaacs. The clothes design you expect is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I would be very surprised if this movie did not receive any complaints after it was broadcast on BBC2 at tea time. Captain St Ives is in bed with a whore where the nipple is fully exposed, and there is a scene of French prisoners bathe including a full nude male nudity, not to mention the murder scene where the blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if the BBC schedules any kind of directories about what they are doing
