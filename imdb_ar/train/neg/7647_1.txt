Madison County Bridges is the best version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not treated as sensitively as in the original English film. This film is strongly linked, if you are a very sensitive person crying in a movie when the hero eventually dies, you will love this movie, on the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and you think that crying would limp. Not like the end. But in general, the subject is treated very well for Indian conditions. The tabbo was good as a wife and mother. Everyone behaves well.
