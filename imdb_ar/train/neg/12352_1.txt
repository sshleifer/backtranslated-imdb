<br /> <br /> How did this film get an average of 6 stars is beyond me. The text is very plain, frankly an insult to whoever builds it. The film industry comes directly from the world of brilliant advertising, and Riddle Scott must be ashamed of the talent. However, Demi Moore does not appear surprise by participating in this film, if we look at the song list. All in all, film-style "high concept" so Don Simpson will be ashamed of them.
