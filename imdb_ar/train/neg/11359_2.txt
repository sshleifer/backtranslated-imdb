While the three-dimensional animation (highlight the show) worked well, most of the other elements remained constant. It was as if filmmakers thought, "Well, it's going to be three-dimensional, so we do not have to work hard on plot or personality development." The fact that a film for children is no excuse at all. The audience is attracted to three dimensional characters (Partner, Nemo's father) as much as they are drawn on 3D graphics. The only dimension to any of the main characters was a two-dimensional scooter who would plot the plot from time to time, forcing him to eat everything on the horizon. <br /> <br /> The absolute winner? Buzz Aldrin finally (after seeing a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical shape for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and destroys a fun time for everyone by describing the main characters in the film as "contaminants" and declaring that the situation has been put on the screen in fact impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Do you just want to tell children that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you are in it?
