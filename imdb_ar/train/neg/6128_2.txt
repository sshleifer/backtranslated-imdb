This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not create a full movie on it! <br /> <br /> The characters are very fake, there is no real story - but short episodes with horrible side characters, are not terrible enough to make the plot real. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for the Hungarian film. They were boring, although they were designed to be real or unique. Maybe they tried much harder than this ... 2 out of 10
