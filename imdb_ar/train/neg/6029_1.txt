If you wonder where conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas come from the United Nations, Israel and international affairs, look no further. <br /> <br /> This supernatural Hollywood movie relies on some Bible passage. Instead, this film was produced by Cloud Ten Pictures, which has a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result sometimes looks like clips from a dependency program (complete with family prayer and breaking light through church windows while playing guitars). <br /> <br /> For mainstream viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as shown in the film. This, perhaps, makes the film important. You may not find a more concise presentation of the exotic views of a large number of your compatriots. So, if you see it, present it as a social / cultural document. If you are media savvy at all, you do not need to be warned of inaccurate attempts at advertising and manipulating the film.
