The long list of "big" names in this click (including John Mills everywhere) did not bother me so much that I could not judge the film based on its actual merits. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, ranging from the humble air hero to the loud sound bulletin. At one point, an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: high, high, loud, then quiet, but then the film went on! I did not find any real story, random writing, but clever school uniform and handsome Jane Simmons (pre-nasal post) with little erotic details. I can not say that this image contains any of the ingredients that make the movie great. I found it a Mudlin, a Maui and a minor.
