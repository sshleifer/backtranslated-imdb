The question, when someone sees a bad film, is not necessarily, "How to make a film that bad?" Or even, "Why did you see this awful in the first place?" But, "What did you learn from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been indexed and flown countless times in the past ten years does not mean that someone will not go ahead and make a movie that uses them all, without an atom of humor or ridicule . <br /> <br /> - If the movie should be labeled ** Loose ** Based on the video game, you are having problems with the script. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character always knows Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> - While you may be proud that you know how to "effect" the budget, this does not necessarily mean that you should use it over and over again from nausea. <br /> <br /> - No Beon Ron Howard's brother ensures the roles of choice. <br /> <br /> - When a scene is not edited together, just use some shots from the video game, no one will notice. <br /> <br /> - Your cousin's rap is free to write the subject of the film, politely rejected. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not the bout of people who kill zombies, they turn around killing zombies, preferably the worst possible way. <b r /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1,600 for delirium deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Two special lines after someone asks, "What was that?" Or, "Where are we from?" <br /> <br /> - Naked breasts are not the bad solution to cinema. <br /> <br /> - Snapshot A helicopter boom and license agreement with Sega transforms your film magically from "Student Film" to "Big Studio Launch". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can drop all three "Living Dead" movies, this does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse movies, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annifilation".
