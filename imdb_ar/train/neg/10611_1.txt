Terrible representation by Potter and the flat plot with no tension whatsoever ever. As for the feminist debate, it is laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and although I found it boring more than believing, I'm glad I went to see it. That's because I now have an immediate answer to the question "What's the worst film I've ever seen?" In addition, I feel comfortable knowing that every film I see throughout my life will be better than tango lessons. But I must admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a text that would receive as many grants as possible from the world's arts council (as shown in the final appropriations). <br /> <br /> I recently watched Orlando and I can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons from making this film. All it took was a collection of bright costumes, a few hard stars for a leading woman's camera, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema in public. So why should not she think she can get away from the amazing nothingness that is tango lesson?
