This is loosely based on the original 80 hit ideas. He was appointed in modern times where we see a base in Afghanistan being destroyed by a drone directly at first. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the movie in which the shark jumps. UAVs are not armed. They could be but I do not think it was ever tried. We got to the computer that orchestrated the process, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We know "Will hacker" Will Farmer (it's good in chemistry and electronics that does not make him a hacker for the computer) and his favor Annie, and The Will's 1st attempt at hacking is not just a complete failure, his IP address is also a record and I guessed it was. We also meet with Wills mom, who works in a chemical company. <br /> <br /> The commandments that get money from the account of his banking neighbors (Mr. Massude) are not a breakthrough (helped him prepare the account), and then we got a nod back to the original movie where they decided not to play World Nuclear Thermal War and they play The Dead Code. The tracking run by the RIPLEY office is not on Will but on a Massude computer so all the evidence they collected was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLEY has turned off the Will machine without explaining it (it's just playing an online game?) and also why I felt the need to close all the electricity in the entire group I lived in too. Why the Counter-Terrorism Agency considers this target to be applicable is highly questionable. As for RIPLEY activate his mobile phone? I do not think so, it was not connected to the computer and will not run the message unless the phone actually answered, so there is more "scientific breakthrough disk" there too. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY customers arrive at the Massude house, take it away, and get an envelope that appears to contain a lot of money. Searching for the car license plate that captured Massude is not a "breakthrough" because you did not see it breaking into the DMV computer. RIPLEY agents who take Dennis at the airport will not have the power to arrest or detain him. Will's mother did not "steal the chemical agents and biological agents" either. Even if they do, they have no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why he was concerned about the arrest of any crime in Canada as a completely different country with laws different from the United States. <br /> <br /> The rogue computer and all the actions he took against the will, his mother and Dennis have not been punished by a government agency. The phone that we see is Will do is the premiere of any pirated skill in the movie, and we also get a breakthrough for RIPLEY which seemed so easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "man" who ran to Annie at the airport and was watching them on the street also had nothing to do with RIPLEY and the funny idea was that RIPLEY could track a cell phone while it was underground stupid like the idea that the computer reads Lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mentioned Stephen Falken as designer of the RIPLEY system replaced him, Joshua Project. We discover that the "man" who happened to be Annie is Falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who falsified his death. <br /> <br /> As we recognize WOPR as "what will help them", RIPLEY won and kept the same sound used at the time. Falken & WOPR are destroyed very quickly after barely being used (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie, and Russian.) They may also create a stand-alone computer system that has the ability to ban or drop chemical weapons on the country in which it operates. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> IP has not been hacked against RIPLEY by Will, he's just talking to one of his friends who are proposing this idea and implementing it.It's very ridiculous to get your login information As soon as RIPLEY is turned on, Joshua's presence as a RIPLEY host (especially after it has been blown into small parts) is a wonderful thing to accompany him and screams from a very desperate writer who has no ideas and wants to finish this film and finish. <br /> <br /> There is a good Awesome RIPLE Y where you play the Dead Code game and see the exception of the descending (say 17 minutes) then RIPLEY says "decontamination in 30 minutes", how foolish so when they can not even keep up with their timer? It is decided to attack Joshua in her inner circles and redirect the missile to Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY is based. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY aware of what you do will not work (surely she would have known if she had Joshua inside because she already learned this lesson in the original film?) Is another reference to the original film. <br /> <br /> Their copy of RIPLEY repeats exactly the same words as Joshua, which forms the end of the original film to illustrate the number of original ideas they could not reach. <br /> <br /> If you want to point the finger at bad and stolen ideas, the men who blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible film and it is best avoided.
