I remember seeing this movie long ago on TV. I remember that the idea of ​​the film revolves around a group of hotel passengers being attacked by ants who eat humans. What I did not remember was how wonderful it was !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on TV late at night. I'm sure it must be wrong because movies like this usually disappear from existence and will not be found again! Susan Summers (at the height of her career playing Crisie on "The Three Company") plays a role in Lakewood Manor. Construction workers install a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ant nest. Or should I say, * ant nest eat man *! One worker is actually under attack by ants. In one minute, he took him out of his clothes one by one, and the next he was covered. The following scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you think this is out of reach, you should see Mirna Loy playing a wheelchair-bound resident who is flown from Manor via a helicopter! I almost imagined she was thinking of comforting because she was airborne from the movie! <br /> <br /> The final scenes depict Susan and Robert Foxworth and a third man sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically a movie. There is really no appeal of "disaster" or "big star" in the film. It was supposed to be a "broadband" TV event at the time. Now, you are lucky if it was docked at 4:00 am on the local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch a episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
