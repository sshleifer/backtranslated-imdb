Wait, do not tell me ... They took out the film and stayed outside the house. As you know, it was possible to film this film in a back alley in New York. "Gangster gangs" I think. Rap gangs, clothes designer duster bands including a handkerchief that was somehow moved from the neck to protect from dust storms to the head. I think it was to protect the head from filtering the heat across the K-Mart caps. It seems that the "horse rental budget" offered the horses. One bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was talking with her words ... I was even though he was talking. As you know, watching this film confirms that it is no longer about representation ... It is about appearances but about money. It can not be too much when it comes to this film. Well, overall, I think this movie will go down as it's the worst film ever. There is one other thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally get an opera?
