It seems that Monsieur Rohmer dislikes this (he does not deny it, but how can he resent it) so that his new film, which may be his last film too , Inch Allah, has been set aside for the time that is similar to watching a dry woad. These wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema have already dubbed it one of the best films of 2007, so it should give you an idea. The reality is not at the top of the Romer agenda, so in France in the fifth century, there is a palace in one of the wings will not be out of place in the Loire Valley while the only other accommodation we see is a rude wooden hut. The story includes nymphs and shepherds, and as Gomer often does, they were inspired by unknown people who passed through. The overall effect is that the annual play at a school for students with special needs was filmed by accident. One is almost tempted to say, "Go back to Godard, everything is forgiven." But even this sad production can not make me utter these words.
