I recently purchased the DVD, and I forget how much I hated the release of "A Chorus Line". Each change was made by the film director Atenborough's story. <br /> <br /> By making the director-cassie relationship very prominent, the hypothesis of the whole set of musical sails comes out of the window. Some music numbers are accelerated and rushed. The program's song gets the full meaning when it crashes for Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The overall staging is fully aware. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it is because a large number of large numbers can still be enjoyed even though the film tries to squeeze everything from joy and spontaneity.
