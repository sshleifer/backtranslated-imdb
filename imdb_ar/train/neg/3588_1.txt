The "Long Walk" follow-up of the 1973 real-life drama surrounding Tennessee's Sheriff Buford Busser, but this installment resembles a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson takes the leading role of Joe Don Baker, but is very moderate for the part; he sings like a country singer with a bat rather than a guitar. Good supporting actors such as Richard Jakele, Luke Askio and Robert Duckey do little. I would like to give the film a single star with its good intentions, but the script is a transparent and simple block of routine dilemmas and cheap production. It was followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 the film "A True American Hero".
