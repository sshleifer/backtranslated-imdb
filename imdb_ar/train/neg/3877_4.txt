I just watched The Melting Man for the second time and it was more boring than I was when I first saw it. I do not understand why they have become like "cult classic" when they are too boring. The opening scene looks promising, when the fatty nurse drops the box of blood and walks for her cherished life. After all this actually happens is that the solvent man chases around some forests and houses, while the memories of the past in his life as an astronaut. Make-up is very good, and the melting face seems somewhat realistic. There is a wonderful scene where a man's head is thrown into the river, and floats up to a waterfall where it falls on the rocks and explodes. Although there is not much to indulge yourself in, most scenes are filmed in the dark and you can not see what is really happening. There are not many gaps, at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. <br /> <br /> No, the "stunning melting of the man" is not wonderful at all. I will give him marks for his cheese factor but this is around him. If you want classic cult fiction / classic horror, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
