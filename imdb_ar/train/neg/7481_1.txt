Someone must tell Goldie Hoon that her teenage career ended 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies released in years, an unambiguous disaster, where the parties give themselves to a frantic display of their brands in an attempt to make up for a bad and misguided scenario. It was supposed to be extinguished at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese gets a big paycheck because of his association with this disaster. He is the only performer who came through this rather stinking chaos and his only mistake is his failure to realize that the rest of the crew will sink the picture.
