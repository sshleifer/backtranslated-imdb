But, let's face it ... I've got a few sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is so wonderful that it allows it a few hiccups. I get a new season, but I enjoy the power as I have two days. I like the idea of ​​closing it, but it was more than just the end of the season episode that will show the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox is supposed to be bald for a few other episodes, the only explanation I can think of is that they changed the rotation of the rings or forced To re-fire from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Because my friends, is why the hell cox is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is awesome ... brought in season seven.
