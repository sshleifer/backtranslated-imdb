T.Z. Post, a university professor, receives a false letter showing he inherited $ 750,000. Now with financial means, he withdraws his life savings of $ 4,000 and decides to go out and live at last. After sending his bags on a train to Chicago, he met a traveling vodafone team and decided his presence was good enough to attend a show on Broadway. On the night of the show, Professor Poor Post has to hide from his creditors and solve the relationship problems between his girlfriend Pansy & Eleanor and singer, and still make sure the show continues. After seeing many silent gems in Keaton, this pain is painful to sit down, but I felt it could have been much worse. Supporting the cast Durant, Todd, and Selwyn bear off their sometimes very nagging, but still gracious. Before Charlie Chan Toler is as good as the director of the show frustrated. 90% of the script was written badly, MGM is trying to pass this movie as Bruce Bruce to the poor man, where many visual gags fall from the beginning. This film was combined with drinking problems in Keaton at the time, which is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Evaluation 3.
