I fully agree with the last commentator, it may be the worst film ever produced. Michael Madsen must have made this movie for someone. The picture quality is gracious all the way. What a small plot here is just stupid. I give this movie 1 out of 10 if I can offer a lower grade I would like. Do not waste your time in this movie or regret it.
