This film reminded me a lot of "history of violence," which was a close study of violence and violent behavior, but ended up being just a short-lived film disguised as an intellectual film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride go to a small English town and face endless harassment by local drunks who do nothing but stop at the bar all day and raise problems. Do not these guys have a job? In any case, Dustin takes everything he can, and at the end of the film carries him home and fights each of the assailants drunk by such hideous means as pouring a whiskey on someone, blowing his feet with a gun and a head person falling into the bear trap. It is funny that someone has to need such a big trap in a small British town except perhaps to put a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Beckenba, who made the film "Wild Bunch", which also covered the subject of the blood of violence that did not deliver anyone. But it was done in style, and you think so. The straw dogs are not reasonable. First of all the site is wrong and does not work. Why put him in England? I might think it is in some of the city's inner sites or in a small town in South America in the 1930s or something else. Second, I do not think it is clear at all why these men rush to violence, but they may be drunk and feel the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Pickenba has missed the mark on this.
