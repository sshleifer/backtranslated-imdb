You just had to write these lines, but they really are. I love this kind of gangster and this is the weakest entry I have seen in recent years. I have a tribute to all participants in most aspects except the most important, scenario. It's a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of good representation or design in black and white films can compensate for the complete lack of material. I love Kevin Spacey and hear that he will do another film about the general. My advice is do not waste your time.
