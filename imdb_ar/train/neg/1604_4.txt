Do you remember a movie you seemed to enjoy in the past that does not meet the same feelings as adults? That's what happened to me when I came back to school .. reunited the national class of Mon Lambon. The film has a perfect chance of laughter, but it is amazingly wandering aimlessly. We see a strange group of characters, such as a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can fire a fire from her mouth, a man who looks like a vampire and a madman wearing a woman's uniform and wearing bags over his head. You have a chieftain who thinks he has the best thing since slicing bread (but as we see in the film, he is a coward and joking), two pot smokers who do not even know they are reunited in the classroom, and there is a man named Gary who knows he even knows his existence No one can seem to remember his name. This is a joking joke that I enjoyed. There is a full oblique who likes to grab women in inappropriate places. She is blind and blind. She has a squeak when she calls her dog, a cook (known from the "dowry" and "throwing a mama from the train") who likes to put food on people's plates with her hands! The film basically revolves around a bag of food trying (or at least trying) revenge from his schoolmates for a gag (they arranged for him to sleep with his twin sister!). The film follows characters as they search for dark, dark pathways in the old high school. The killer told them by his psychologist who seemed a little strange. The film contains a few good gags that work (very early), but the film gets worse slowly every minute passes. The real problem with the film is that it does not know where to go. The film is by far a one-joke hypothesis because it contains a direction that is not guaranteed .. if it has any direction at all. The actors are excited enough, but the materials they want are funny and do not have the quality that interests them. It is a masterpiece of the early 1980s comedy lovers who are forgotten (this one really).
