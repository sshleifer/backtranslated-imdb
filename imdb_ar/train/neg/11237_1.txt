I went to see this film with low expectations, but I hope to be enchanted by seeing my original city on the film. Unfortunately, that's all I got. The story covers a familiar terrain (high school reunion), but the plot is wrapped up and the supernatural element adds little to this obsolete theme. Although the quality of acting was generally good, the content of the film was awful. The sexual bias of the film was blatant - women apparently did not materialize unless they were married, spoken or both (although this was chosen as an option for post-feminism). Worse still is racism - the cruel Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - and the unwarranted cruelty (torture of the class geek). We should be ashamed if these figures are thought to represent the inhabitants of Kalamazoo, and the book must be shameful because they brought these broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
