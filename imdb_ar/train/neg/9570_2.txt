For the first time in years, I felt the need to log on to IMDb today to purge myself of this film by writing a review, because it was just allowing to watch. The plot seemed terrible when I read it, I was expecting a simple tale of mystery, and an obsessive haunting chase. Unfortunately, everything is very bad because of a tired and tired love story and a lot of jammed movies and stupid "stupid" - no one says such things, except bad movies "just painful. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick tour of the worst crimes in This movie: <br /> <br /> - The script relies heavily on the inexplicable and inexplicable mysteries and stupidity of the main characters that are just funny ... No, in fact, it is angry. - Related to this: cheap thrill A long procession "in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - Main characters Well, it seems that the scriptwriter never tested real human beings But instead he acquired all his knowledge of bad films, and so his boring, vulgar characters from the second generation are just conspirators, the owners of a place without the slightest bit of personality. "They are" a disintegrating man and woman who still love each other "I've never seen it before in 100000 movies and it has not become more realistic or fun." Think about Hollywood's two-dimensional Hollywood fare: There's no single character in this movie, so it's new, attractive, or interesting remotely. <br /> <br /> - The vague and ambiguous accuracy that oscillates is very bad and needs only one push to overthrow it, although the word may be the "solution" is not appropriate here, because the film is a swamp mess that goes nowhere on anyway. By the time it passes, though, she is no longer interested. The last third of the film I just sent, because it was unbearable to see. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all. No matter what features this film recovers, it is buried all because of incompetence. You do not see this shit.
