The film had a good concept, but the implementation did not live up to it. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, wise story, it's "Dirty Harry" meets with "M". A child murderer began terrorizing the city. Key investigators (Dennis Hopper and Frederick Forest) have not dealt with a serial killer before. Mayor and police chief, in desperation, secretly hire local mobs to speed things up ... to go to places and do things the police will not be able to put an end to this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie already has some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> Besides the concept, I liked the look of the deadly hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This man has a strange sewer. In some shots, light reflects water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; these scenes often give dream-like creepy quality. <br /> <br /> The acting was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who are improving with age. <br /> <br /> Once you get over it, it becomes more or less steep. <br /> <br /> The movie is displayed quickly and the road is very fast. The actual investigation process from both teams is very emotional compared to the complex and wonderful feeling. It could have been fixed in two ways: either make the film longer or cut off several of the sub-charts. Either of these options would allow the crew to devote more time to the actual ambiguity. <br /> <br /> For example, how bad this is, one of the important keys to helping them focus on the right suspect is this: at some point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop ... that's true ... I am very serious here. It looks as if they have moved from point A (first idea) to point Z (suspect) and have gone through all the "internal" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones I really liked were two small pockets they met in the middle of the film. Because they are lowercase letters, I have called them a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a mob angle. This is the thing that gets me the most because that's why I made $ 3 to buy a DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! There was an absolute abundance of serial killer clicks in the last 10-15 years. The mob angle was a gimmick that helped her rise above the rest ... but she did not. <br /> <br /> I thought gang tactics would be brutal, but fun and exciting at the same time. Kind of like a wake-up movie or something ... maybe they were throwing up some of the film's elements too stealing. We are talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we give some heroes of rejection committed to celluloid. Investigators are questioning witnesses. What do mobs do? They interrogate and kill them. It is not as if these witnesses are so bad. I have found in fact that criminals are less likely than the killer they hunt. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points you mentioned are enough to get your interest, I say that this person will not miss you. Maybe someday, they'll reuse the idea of ​​the story itself and do it. I hope so. I hate to see such a good concept wasted.
