After I grew up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what was in Giles, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live as this film indicates. The plot is weak, the fake dialects amusing, and reinforce the stereotype that all Texans drink alcohol, Honky Tonkin, retarded. Accurately horrible Texas dialects is what kills it for me. True, there is some Texas in Texas in most Texas dialects, but these people overcame it. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do the Texas dialects. It just does not work. John Travolta must be adhering to disco or fifties dancing. Debra Wenger was more convincing as a wonder girl than she is in Texas.
