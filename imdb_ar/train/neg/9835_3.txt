Before explaining the "Alias" comment, let me say that "The Desert Trail" is even bad by Westerners who stare at the Three Stooges. In fact, Carmen Larrox appears as a quasi-bad girl, Juanita, when she hears her Mexican accent, she will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from Stooge's short classic "Saved by the Belle." <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail," John Wayne got Moe Howard, while Eddy Chandler got Curly Howard. Like their counterparts in Stooge, a continuous frenzy throughout the 53-minute film is Moe Curly hit. Wayne's character, the skirt that haunts the bully, is not very likable, but is supposed to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> The mobile cowboy has played Wayne with a rodeo box office at gunpoint and gets the prize money he would have won if the attendance was good, and the other contestants had to settle for 25 cents on the dollar Wayne steals the box office). No explanation has been given for Wayne to tear off the riders and still consider the hero who gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Things are getting complicated at this point because Al Ferguson and Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who will continue to play the role of Sheriff Mika on The Rifleman) watch Wayne Robb at the box office Then he stole the rest of the money and killed the director of Rodeo. Mo and Curly get blamed. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and change their names to Smith and Jones. They first meet but their old friend Larry, who becomes his sister is the love interest in the second half (leaving Rita Senorita behind the old town and does not show any other scenes in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is beautifully played by the beautiful and beautiful Mary Corneman (she grew up now but in her youth she was one of the original members of "Our Gang" for Hal Roach). Kornman is the main reason for watching the huge Western and its scenes with Moe and Curly much better than anyone else in production, as if they used a completely different crew to photograph them. <br /> <br /> Until 1935, the sequence of events in this thing was very poor and the film industry was very poor. The scene ends with the main chase footage with wide shots of a racer falling from a horse. Each time the editor turns to one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is quite different, and the character wears different clothes from the rude racer. There is a liberal use of stock quotes elsewhere, so none of them is remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch is a scene in the middle of the film where Moe and Curly ride on their horses and ride (on the right) from a cabin as the scene moves towards the cabin from the left. The photographer follows the two people with a slow right handle, then a left whip handle to expose the nearest veil. Outside the home movies, I've never seen anything like that, not because he looks stupid (which he does), but because the qualified director will never show the scene that way. They photographed the two passengers as they left, then replaced the camera and saw the images coming as a separate work. Or if they feel creative, they will display the sequence until the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the buzzer approaches the background. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
