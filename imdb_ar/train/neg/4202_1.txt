... forgot something here ??? "Unexpected plot developments"? "Plot twisting with blissful sublime"? Are these viewers watching the same Arquette vehicle that I have just subdued (in a conscious shift that is now unclear from Saddamism) ... I just joined this site to make sure no one else is renting this stink. This movie was embarrassing for everyone concerned ... Quick question: Did Sir Stevie read the script before he gave him the thumbs to Kate S.? If so, then it must be Spielberg himself who threw the green light on "Howard the duck" ... Do not give me that, "It was a wonderful play" - I think Egypt. Radin is not too happy ... DVD cover promised "snap angles" and "crooked story ..." story !! a story ?? It's such nonsense that makes old Bobby Mackie and his roving band of structuralists look like geniuses ... Sundance ?? Berlin? Toronto? I have a home video of my cat that is more interesting than Arquette's portrayal of a terrible loss ... and talk about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T. Thank God, soon the time he thought Dave was calling the cops! Thank Shiva that the police have just caught the real killer ... what !!! Even the credits that I was still waiting for to be some sort of friction against Arkit and the "hidden millions" ... No, Mrs. Spielberg, you do not get away with the harm: what the hell was that scene in the kitchen with the "athlete's foot in my crotch" gag ??? Are you worse at this or "just cause"? I do not like ... Lovers movies: Why not make her a lively night and rent it with a "Jersey Girl" and "White Chicks" then commit sepukka (or she seppuka) ... and take E. Donsky with you ....
