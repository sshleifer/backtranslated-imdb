This film revolves around circles, and the viewer does not know where it is. At first I thought that mmmmm, it could be a great movie, but it only lasts, and in the end you do not know what's going on. The main female is a good actress and played her role well, and psychological elephants, creeping, but after a while do not really care about what happens, because this film continues only. It's really shameful that this might be a lot better. <br /> <br /> It can be said that although the female novelist and the psychological bullet, they will have a good career in front of them, but will they remember this film, to make them known, or because they are the film regret that they ever.
