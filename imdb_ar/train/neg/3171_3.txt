Was this the greatest film I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it's good to see something light and mushy. It was wonderful, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> I thought there was definitely room for improvement, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the utmost level of abuse from the other reviewer. Obviously they do not care about Eva Longoria. I think it was better in this than it was in the Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Representatives play a major role in determining whether they are successful or volatile. <br /> <br /> The cast may not have worked. There may have been many things happening. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk about an average movie, not terrible. It can be just a chick flick. Such as The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about these. :)
