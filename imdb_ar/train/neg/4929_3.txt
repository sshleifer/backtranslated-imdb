The spoilers are presented in this review as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this fashion melodrama is to know that our hero, Mrs. Barbara Skelton, is raped and shot at the end. And not a very close moment. I had picked up the screen myself but I was afraid to hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, "The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (I think people did not do that (then the spoilers at that time), written by a woman, a naughty English Navy was either troubled Or sarcastic or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to believe that if you have beauty, nothing else is important. But there are other important things, such as that Ms. Barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in the way is murder. She kills three men in five attempts. It is the story of a fetal series and suffers from a chronic personality disorder that must have landed in Bedlam or Newgate. Lockwood plays her role as a narcissistic figure, wearing so much make-up that I thought she was Joan Rivers, dating back to the Age of Restoration (or "Joan Rivers" dating back to the Restoration Age, ha!). However, Ms. All three main characters - Michael Renney, James Mason, and Griffith Jones - do not resist all of them, and they all do a good job, as Patricia Rock does. Of course, the three fans are briefly aware of what Barbara's mental whore is, but the plot keeps them all in orbit until someone shoots them - by chance, with either the irony or the sweets. Looking at the dramatic death scene with the crane arm that lifts the camera out of the windows and goes towards the sky, I suppose we are supposed to give a damn about her death. But her salary is the first body we do not care about.
