I understand what this film was trying to portray. How the elderly are often ignored and treated as a chaperone, which means that they end up feeling disrespectful and that their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with this letter, but I just feel that it can be developed in a very painless way to watch. I enjoy a good technical film, but when the film becomes intrusive to self-awareness (as in this case) the result is very frustrating. Including footage of someone who slowly fills a bag for 5 minutes, tried to identify a point but ended up annoying the audience. <br /> <br /> Female characters are very weak and eventually end up wanting to tell them to pull them together. It's a movie you feel you should enjoy or appreciate at a high level and certainly have "its merits" but I was very disappointed to see it and recommend it to anyone else. It may have a deeper message than the other Roger Michell films (eg "Notting Hill") but at least it was a movie you could enjoy watching.
