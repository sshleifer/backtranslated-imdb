Primary species (1996, Jonathan Winfrey Abbey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when their shipment turns into live dinosaurs. The army commando team now has to think quickly, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human race, rather than reptiles. <br /> <br /> Look at the cover and gain your first impressions of the film. This is pretty much it. Acting is acceptable only by a few characters. The story is poor, as the entire film relies on the Army and Marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came three years after the "Jurassic Park". Instead, it seems that this film came out 13 years before the "Jurassic Park". Bad dinosaur costumes, I mean fashion. Obviously there are people dressed, this film does not try to hide it. A scene is created when a dinosaur runs in a corridor in a way that looks like someone riding the creature. Is one good thing, which comes out of this film. Short runtime. In one hour and only 15 minutes, do not waste much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a nightmare on Friday 13th." - Officer (Brian Currie)
