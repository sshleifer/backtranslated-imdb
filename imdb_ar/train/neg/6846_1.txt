I am a big fan of Karisma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after watching Fiza, which was absolutely wonderful. <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and there are cr * p movies. But this film only takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> We were so upset that we were upset about paying our money to expect a decent film. <br /> <br /> Avoid them at all costs, so do not rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
