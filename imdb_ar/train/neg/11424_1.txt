I noticed that the "fire" was on the cable last night and started to watch it because I could not remember anything specific about it except that I remember it was a terrible film when I saw it again in 85. Twenty years later, the film is still appalling. Along with the mix, saxophone was the most abusive instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as evident in the title song. Hearing that song again made me want to unscrew the screwdriver in my ears to end their voice misery. To further complicate this musical attack, Rob Lowe played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played alone and continued as if Charlie Parker, only the tone of his screams and his play was more remembered by a monkey playing Kazuo. All the characters were very unattractive, although I must say they did a wonderful job in selecting equally unattractive representatives to photograph them. In fact, I thought Mary Winningham was attractive, and initially felt sorry for her personality because she was wearing funny lingerie, but near the end of the film she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character that is likely to be voted on to move a variety of sexual diseases if voted on this thing.
