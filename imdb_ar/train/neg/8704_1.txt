In general I love dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap. No text, no dialogues, no acting. The brave Colonel Rance tries to show that he is tough and curling his mouth is like the stupid brother Proctor of the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately it was not a waste of money as I saw the movie on TV). I really can not understand 7 people who rated this sh * t 10. They should be joking. My advice, if you see this address starting from it!
