The problem with this film is that it was filmed on the worst possible camera and that the film is misty and grainy. Perhaps the truth is that anyone who was carrying the camera could not stand because he was suffering from a fit or something. There is also a lot of tube and vomiting in this film. There's a person who vomits every twenty minutes, and that makes me think this was done by some shrews or something. It was disgusting. Then there is an annoying scream of high tone that extends and lasts and does not stop until the credits accumulate. I also did not like when all her friends were shot (or do not know), they go in the truck and put in the help of the band. That was just so stupid in the film. How much gas can a person pull to get a car? It must be all because the gas is not running out in the rest of the film. It was a terrible film and I suggest that I have never seen it throughout your entire life.
