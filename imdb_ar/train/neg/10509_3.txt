After being plundered from the sky, a gang of naked female angels (with big plastic fangs) took up residence in a nervous forest where they fed on any miserable souls you had to walk around. It was not long before a group of friends fell on a road trip victim of bloodthirsty children ?? Forest of the Damned, a low-budget horror in the UK, is an interesting idea and is being driven out by some of the worst behavior, effects and direction I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows some taste sometimes behind the camera? The viewer in the late house is somewhat tense, and there are some "shock" moments that are handled brilliantly - but for the most part of the film, the amateurs are technically. Enjoy some truly terrifying displays of horror icons Tom Savinie and Shawn Hotson, and you have one real bad movie on your hands. <br /> <br /> Some fun may derive from the magnificence of the movie, and there are plenty of female nudity to taste, but most will find this a must to sit down.
