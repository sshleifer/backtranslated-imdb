Holo Point is a good movie worth a half price rent or if there is nothing else at a fun time without having to think. There are bangs required and actress Hammy and the ladies are beautiful. Very good team with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow, and beautiful Tia Carrier. This actor in addition to a light hearted touch makes a great film, but it is not fun ... on a scale of one to ten .. a 4
