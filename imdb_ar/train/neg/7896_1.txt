I'm not sure why this movie has got such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the irrational random plot that was on the screen. It seems that the entire film is nothing more than an exercise in self-indulgent self-indulgence, by the director. The fact that the director / writer goes on behalf of just one title reinforces this sense of phenomenon. <br /> <br /> It would be better for those interested in watching independent films to look for something better written and dare say, more enjoyable than the waste of this full time.
