Comedy Central was successful in original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show, and the popular Colbert Report are all professional comedians, all of whom, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were strong performances. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics at work, I was expecting good things when I took over. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Funny sequences, but given that the star is a Silverman caliber, the display may be much better. I was just a pilot and hope to have a better next week's show. If not, ask them for help in a better book format for viewing.
