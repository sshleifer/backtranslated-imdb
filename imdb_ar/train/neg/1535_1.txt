I do not think you can become much worse this. Gather bad actors, fake parties, three stupid stories and what do you get? This is a meaningless excuse for level B of the film. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows poor video quality and really pathetic representation, especially when the 25-year-old girl pretends to be a grandma grandmother usually a cake on a little ears. Plus, the guy is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "Looks great!" Not! The waswolf in this person was the best of the three, but still not impressive because it was a bad costume. The face on the woman was later fit enough for all saints, but not for a wolf film. <br /> <br /> More stories are getting worse. There are two lesbians in this next one who have completely left her silly. The whole "I want to be a werewolf," "How can you do this to me?" It was ridiculous to say. I asked for it now to skip it! You will not even talk about the bereaved ... about mice! <br /> <br /> The third has no point ... Nearly forty-five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and everything the switch still did not make it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... Who could not even hear some of the parts that were stupid. The animals were either mice or pigs that were stupid. They can not use Assad's voices? No, do not use good movies it. Well, I = you enjoy B rates and this is good for you. I've got this movie because I'm a fan of hardwolves and I'll buy a movie of a werewolf and watch it more than once, but that's just me. If you prefer good things, do not waste your money. I beg you!
