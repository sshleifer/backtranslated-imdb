If you love the first two films, I'm sorry you will not like this movie. This is really garbage and not directly needed to video, and perhaps a TV-made sequel. The world is still Wayne Salinsky (Rick Moranese) who is still a stupid but pleasant living with his family and has his own company, the Zlinsky company. His brother. Then his wife and his wife's sister also shrink. Adults now have to find a way to make their children grow up. Very frequently repeated two others with one or two new things, eg roller coaster toy car, swimming in dip, ect. Very poor!
