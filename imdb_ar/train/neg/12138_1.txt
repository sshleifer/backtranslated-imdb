SERIOUS IN THE HOME / KARATE KID stops working enough stereotypes of the bad character to make the writer sue and then shoot him. You can see the use of stunt man in nearly every scene. Oh, the representation also suck. Although I must say that line: "Sorry, my friend, I have to spend a great time in the dump" made me laugh my ass.
