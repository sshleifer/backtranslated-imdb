I saw on TV late last night. Yes, I can hear what you are saying about this. It is likely to be classified as one of the typical television series. In all fairness, the story line has a good twist on it, and you can nod, saying, "Well, that's not what I expected." However, as a film, it is not easy to discover the recovery element. Casting, acting, camera action, cars, fashion, setup, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. R RATING?? Oh, this scene. Do we need it? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you saw it. What is the title again?
