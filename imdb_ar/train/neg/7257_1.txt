I was expecting a B - French musician. After all, Dhéry, Blanche and DeFunès were stars of low-budget French films at the time. It is in color! But I have hallucinations at this incredible hour of 30 from sheer badness. The music numbers are awful, and the comedy is very boring and stupid. And songs? What songs? This is just a series of bad numbers, one by one. The only very rare thing about this thing is nudity of women. It was not familiar at that time. In fact, there are some figures to show us naked women. He adds to the mediocrity! He tried to find young Michelle Serail, the future great actor of French cinema, in part as a musician, in his first film. good luck!
