I saw this movie by accident yesterday in the cinema. I had some hopes in the film because I really loved Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it was based. The film starts well because it initially looks like a great movie. Although quickly the film becomes a mess with intriguing schemes, characters that never materialize and did not care about anyone from the audience (such as Marjoke) have terrible editing. The movie fades into very long black parts, a messy timeline that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that do not add anything to the story and can easily be dropped. After suffering the story you will deal with one of the worst endings I've seen in a long time. Also note that the movie contains a lot of explicit sex scenes that you may be familiar with if you watch a lot of Dutch films. It's hard to mention any good things about this film. About one-third of the audience was already out of the theater in the middle of the film and I did not hear a good word after the film ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. It really destroyed any faith you had left in the Dutch film industry.
