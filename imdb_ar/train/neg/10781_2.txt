In fact, it is not. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to reproduce the 1940 comedy. What a mess! None of these people came close to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc. In any case, today's audience does not accept this friendly mud. The writing is trivial. The vulgar plot is thin and clear. Chemistry among leading figures does not exist. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she embodies some of the big stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, whenever it is. It's an effect you're trying to achieve and failed to achieve again with Richard Gear in the movie Runaway Bride.
