This film tells the story of the open-ended Frannie suddenly returning to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but not aware of the death of her mother. Her sister runs the family house, but plans to sell it and move away with her new husband. Franny strongly objects to the idea, vowing to preserve the family heritage as it was, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> Robin comes handsome and the two will fall in love (as you do), and from this point I put a lot of attention ... <br /> <br /> Nothing is more interesting Farah Fawcett than blond hair And his form, can portray a very convincing figure when she puts her mind to it - and is certainly confirmed here as well as some of her previous efforts such as extremism and small sacrifices - a wonderful display of the legendary Charlie Angel film. <br /> <br /> Silk Hope is the kind of film that is never shy away from its cheap and cheerful television image, and knows there is a budget limit, but it is not the worst film ever produced. Positive aspects exist; you only have to find them.
