Before I start, I _love_ Eddie Isard. I think it's one of the most extreme situations today. Maybe that means I'm going to this with very high expectations, but I did not find Eddie funny on this trip. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as an irrelevant comedian, and we all love him for it. But in Circle, it seems to have nothing to do with the funny thing more than it's funny, and I've totally lost in some places. Many of the topics he has covered and which he has covered before - I think I realized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD, you'll find a behind the scenes look at Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not very funny), and the French version of one of his shows. Die-hards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language, but the translated comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you either got it already or you'll go to buy it all I say. If you just pass, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With the circle, probably will.
