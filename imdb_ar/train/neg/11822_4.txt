I thought Harvey Keitel, a young man, was new to Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, Inio Moricon. I was expecting an Italian Policeman thriller from an old school made in America. I've got a mishmash story that was never logical and a film left me saying: WTF !!! Many questions have not been answered, not enough action. Result: Potential cult classics were thrown down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work together well, so Quentin Tarantino may be able to bring these men together with a better text. Oh, Morricone degree: Well, but do not forget. <br /> <br /> In general, do not waste time, but not a "must see", unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan.
