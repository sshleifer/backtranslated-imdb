First, I would like to excuse my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of HOSTEL, but I liked this movie though. Live broadcast, however, sucked a great time! I have never seen a wonderful film with a wonderful acting, but hey, who surprised? The representation in Live Feed was ... well, there is not! I've seen some commented on this because it should be a school project or something. Well, but not by students in the media or acting school. This was not a row at all! What about the story? Really sad tore on a hostel. What about Gore? What about the scenes of psychological torture that are supposed to distort the courage and leave the cold sweating? This was the most disappointing about the pit movie! Short edge, fast and no. More like execution than torture. Well, there are buckets of blood, but they did not look real. Slaughter and Brindhead's violence are reported more than lodges or any of the saws. Braindead was fun! Well, I've laughed at Live Feed several times, but it was more than just a disappointment over pure! <br /> <br /> So instead of wasting 80 minutes watching Live Feed, watch anything else!
