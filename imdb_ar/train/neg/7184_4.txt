This was not really a very good movie. There were a lot of improbable and unpredictable things that happened during the film ... but I think most reviewers are missing the point that a broad audience should enjoy this film. This movie was produced by Magic Johnson! Is not that enough to inspire us all to examine this film? A film produced by a former NBA star does not come every day, as you know. Beautifully stupid children in a big house are broken by an ax that uses psychic. All the clich√©s went out in order to perish. Teen sex. All of this has been produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen drug abuse! Hynix College! All of this has been produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
