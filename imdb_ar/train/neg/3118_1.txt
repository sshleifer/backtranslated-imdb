I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing no conspiracy .. wait something happened and nothing dries like a bone .. a waste of money .. one of the worst movies Robbins Williams .. If you do not believe me wait a few months, it will be displayed on DVD Because this seems to be a pattern for movies that do not produce good results in theaters where rents before the end of the year ... this kind will not like to see or say why my money spent on it! In addition to being a new film, there were only 8 people watching it .... this was a 9:50 Friday night show. I also felt they needed more excitement or something to keep us awake. When people spoke in the film, the voices were too low and could not hear what they were saying.
