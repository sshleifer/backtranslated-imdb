Yikes. This is so bad. The play is not great at first, and the decision to transfer it to the film does not help it - especially since Peploe does not decide how you want to treat the origins of the play (we get casual looks for a theater audience etc.) and decided to move in a fast editing style to keep reminding you that you see A film, while in fact it reminds you that you are watching a very bad film directed by a director drenched with materials. Mira Sorvino's performance is very poor: the first stage is difficult, it seems as if she is playing in the film "Helena Bonham Carter" of Ivory Ivory. Fiona Shaw only performs remarkably - and its play ratio may mean that it is best able to handle materials - but it's hard to see a single performance film, even if it's as light and perfect as it was. Ben Kingsley turns into an average turn, and his daughter Diana Reg, Rachel Stirling, plays her equally supportive role. Unfortunately, Bertolucci's charm has not been rubbed on his wife if this film is evidence.
