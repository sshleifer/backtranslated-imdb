As you all know, JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the person who sells all video sequences. Recently released a film called "BLEED", he was selling it to the Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW was introduced. The buyer convinced Blackbuster not to take any JIGSAW, and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like flipping, and that BLEED looks successful. The main problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, golden. I urge you all to go to the BLEED website and vote for the movie that misjudged JIGSAW and all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and make high votes for it (if it is not already). We need to get JIGSAW up to 8 or 8.5 at least, and bleed to about 2 (and thus put it in the list of the worst 100 movies online). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you all are fine, - Matt
