When I was a child in the 1970s, there was a local theater with trainee children every Saturday and Sunday (remember one of them?). They showed this thing one year at Christmas time. I and some friends went to see it. I was expecting a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was terribly dubbed (you can tell him) and a really creepy film. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and the charming Merlin (do not ask me what these two people do in the same movie) are fighting the devil (some joker in the costume of a silly devil full of horns!). The pictures were swinging in my seat. I have always found that Santa is a vampire to start up so it does not help. The man in the devil's suit did not help. But what really amazed me was the wooden deer that pulled Santa's sleigh. When they end up with their frightening voice and movements - I remember having nightmares about these things! After all these years, I still remember coming out of this theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were too scared of that. I saw a TV ad on him and all those nightmares went back. This annoying little annoying Christmas movie may scare the pants of any toddler he sees. Avoid this one - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets 1.
