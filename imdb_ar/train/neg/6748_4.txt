Let me be saying that I continued watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw seemed like the greatest horror bout of all time although I thought it was pretty good. Very bad bleeding. The best part is seeing naked female casts. Gore is a very fake looking and more than done. It contains funny but very predictable parts and I did not want to stay to see the terrible end. If I can, I will ban these actresses and actresses, and the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) was in more than a hundred other videos, and I also saw two other members of the animation team in equal or worse. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
