What can I say. The film Kamal Hassan being terrible. It behaves very well, but it is a terrible story, along with the terrible trend. In my gentle opinion, director Gutham Menon should give up guidance. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the film. Apart from that, one can not believe the validity of those horrific crimes. There was no practical application in the film. Gotham runs out of stories. But Kamal Hassan and Giutica are doing well. The bad guys look very ugly, although their performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can watch with family. You will not sleep watching this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj once again did a wonderful job, which is why I was given this movie 4 out of 10. His song "Partha Modail Nallae" is full of vitality. Apart from that, the cinema is great. On the whole, this is just a bad film. I think Kamal Hassan should have rejected this film.
