Ouch! They do not come much worse than this terrible adaptation of the novel Si. Louis. Although the adaptation is perfectly true with the novel, the representation is horrendous and the groups and special effects have an equivalent scale for school play. I've read that the budget for this mini was the biggest that the BBC gave at the time, but it certainly has collected just over $ 2 that seems to have been filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know the effects of the computer were not at the necessary level or even cost-effective at the time, but the fashion shop man wearing a suit was terrible. It is better to cut the character of the film than to do so to the role! Avoid this at all costs.
