Is there a more tolerant and more decisive movement than the environmental movement? For a young buddy who joins the circus, it must look as scary as joining a real circus. Although these people usually outsource Hollywood to these important issues, Hollywood's teachings may seem fragmented and often confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach new hippies in the art of the environment. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of betting your finger against anyone without losing your smile. You will learn how to ignore logic and science with strong arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by marking it as a gateway to Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning how to lie straight, you will also learn how to ignore the accusations that have turned your way no matter how hypocritical you are. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore, while people treat you as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season, it was more useful where we were able to visit other Hollywood goddesses, to be your holy names, and to scrutinize - any judge - their lifestyles. Note: This is the only time that an environmentalist fits into judging someone else because it allows the victim the opportunity to buy all kinds of expensive and trendy environmental games so that they can shake their finger in the faces of others. <br /> <br /> What does Ed have in our store in the third season? Perhaps he will teach us how to be judgmental during sleep!
