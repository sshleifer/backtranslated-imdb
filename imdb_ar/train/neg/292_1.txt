I saw it by chance on the cable that I wanted to like because I thought Sandra was very funny than I remembered. The only facial movement I have seen throughout the film is amazed by the horror of the film I've just had. <br /> <br /> The person who said this is one of the most entertaining movies ever, please point to one line, just one scene, worth a chuckle. <br /> <br /> She's a much better singer than I remember, but I did not want to see a lounge party. <br /> I think this is a movie that you tried so hard to like because they think they should not see it objectively.
