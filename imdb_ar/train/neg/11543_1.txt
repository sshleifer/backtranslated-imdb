Although I frequently use this site to learn how others have rated what I think is challenging or just fun movies, after watching this "movie" in the fourth film last night I felt I had to write something, even if it helped cleanse the time Other. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film was the most shallow experience I have ever experienced - the main characters who played Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be on Scully like Leonard Nimoy) will always be Spock) did not have any real content about them - I'm not sure if the first half of the film did not wrap up the final but certainly in the film Revenge want some sympathy for the victims ... here I could not pay less attention. In fact, the only character that I seem to care about is the dog, where the deer comes in second. Both animals outperformed Dire (sic) and Scully, who were frankly scared. I think you're as good as the text I gave you, and I would like to warmly thank the writers, the producers, the director and all the actors for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some very good electricity.
