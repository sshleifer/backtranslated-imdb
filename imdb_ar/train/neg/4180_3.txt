I picked up this movie to replace the bad choice of television during the day and go with my thirst for dead women. Well, for the former, it's better than daytime TV .... although I'm not sure how big it is. <br /> <br /> He has his points, but after about 20-30 minutes, the good points go up and you come to the conclusion that they are watching a movie dedicated to a TV movie that has been combined with not much time to do something that will be cohesive. In short, a terrible Sci Fi movie. <br /> <br /> His points such as the future are bad, such as "Blade Runner" showed ..... Of course, this is not a "Blade Runner." The captain, like Robert Forster, looks like the kind of person he might want The crew consists of poor copies of the clever defenders of the "aliens", the wool is the vampire and Willow condenses sexually, and the new captain like Jean-Michel Vincent may be running on the "danger island" in "splinters"; he was wearing the uniform The only military with the book; they got very little right in. They all run with their version of gray power inside a ship much like the "Eureka Maru" because they fight a class N "people" who occupy the universe and are divided into several different cults or denominations of evolutionary qualities ....... Just like Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> It may have a recovery feature with Michael Ironside, but after For a while, one feels that he has taken the part as he shouted - he may have enjoyed doing it, but he does not help the film much. <br /> <br /> It's ... well ... well, the way it can be seen DVD once without turning it off; if they see it with commercials, they are likely to change the channel. One can see it once .......... But after a few hours, I wonder what made them watch everything. <br /> <br /> For me, that was the woman's fuse. ............ when she was fighting.
