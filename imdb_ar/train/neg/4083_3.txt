I watched this movie when it was released, and I have been hugged by all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to capture every literary image in the storm and make it literal. If someone is told, "My heart travels," a real human heart will appear, with wings of a pigeon attached, fluttering on the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes some luminous paintings, but in the end it is an easy exercise. It becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I do not underestimate the fun that other viewers found in this film, but we should know that not everyone was upset.
