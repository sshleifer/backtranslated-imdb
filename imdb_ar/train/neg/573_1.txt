The last reviewer was very generous. I am as calm as the first film, but I can not say that I enjoy this film very much. The beginning is possible, but it descends very quickly. I just do not see John Bon Jovi's "Bad Vampire Hunter" and Princess Vampire is neither exciting nor scary. Lots of meaningless scenes. I mean, any ordinary person might suspect something happens when a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone a seasoned fisherman. Why is Ona able to communicate with Goofy? Nothing was explained in this film, you would not mind being amusing, but that was much needed. This must be one of the worst vampires I have ever seen.
