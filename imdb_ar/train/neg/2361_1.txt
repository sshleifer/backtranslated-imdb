This film is the worst in the series easily. Although the new line may only look at sales, they all know the only reason why this line earns more money than it did before because of its 3D end. It was not that the three-dimensional was also good, because it was three-dimensional in the fifties using red and blue lenses (engraving). It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Beyond that this movie was so bad! Bad scenario, bad characters, bad behavior, worse guidance. This film tries to push the camp worker so much that it resembles a Looney Tunes episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not to the audience of horror, because it is tacky and not scary, not funny or amusing to comic crowds. Just a complete mess with some evil demons who are still trying to play this whole thing as a camp and shorten what they probably want. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who were impressed that this series was just praying to end at this point due to its poor condition. This is one of the films that helped to grab the horror of her popularity and ride a lot of the belief that the fans really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy of seeing a good and scary horror film.
