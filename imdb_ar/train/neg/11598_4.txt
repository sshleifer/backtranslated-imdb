When you look back on another bad nightmare like Freddy's Revenge, you have to give it at least some credit for trying something new. Although Dream Dream is more fun, it offers nothing new at all for this series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, such as a child becoming part of a comic book and facing Super Freddy, but even such scenes do not get used to their full potential and parts that do not contain Freddy boring. <br /> <br /> This represents the official death of scarcity in the series. It seems that Freddy is comical satisfaction now ... but to what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
