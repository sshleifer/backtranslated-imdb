This type of film, where a mentally ill of one kind or another tries to damage the reputation (and ultimately the ultimate elimination) of a naive person in order to control his life. Examples include: Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and 1000 movies dedicated to television. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, can offer at least some of the characters paranoid or suspicious or some intriguing plot, Entryful Entry plays everything in the book. This was not because of the reputation of his stars (Kurt Russell, Ray Leota, and Madeleine Stowe). <br /> <br /> Russell plays Michael Carr, unceasingly a na√Øve man who calls for the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his home and tries to attack his wife (Madeleine Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly gives up his anger because he feels helpless in the attitude toward the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a normally mentally ill and limitless villain. At first sympathizing with Carr (perhaps pretending only to do so), the police officer agrees with the couple. But soon the police want to get Carr out of the way, destroying the lives of the players in any way possible (which is very easy when you are a policeman, and when you are the policeman who installed the man's security system at home) Get his wife. It seems less oriented towards ends, and more like a policeman just wants to prove his strength. The wife is like a cup, in other words, not an end. The entire story is displayed by the book, and you can predict each time before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of those movies. From the "horrific" moment, our naive main character is aware that he is a victim of credit card fraud (committed by the mentally ill villain) to the end of its course at the end - it is not dead already.
