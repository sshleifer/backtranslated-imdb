Evil Aliens owes a great debt to Peter Jacksons' innovative Bad Taste and Braindead. I have to admit that I do not enjoy those films at all, and I say the same about this. Those looking to them. I've lost the number of times Hollywood's main film, notably James Cameron, has been outsourced. The amount of blood and presentation here is not funny either, as the final end of the film is tired and may be better than acting as a short film. The actors are poor, the trend is weak and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director was trying to do, the honor he was trying to pay, but others did the same thing much better than he did here. 10/04
