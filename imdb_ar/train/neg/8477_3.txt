I personally hated this film because it was expected, and the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was to tear apart "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a hidden girl being shipped to a place she does not belong to. The whole place hates her, and it makes matters worse that there is a warm man who does not seem to like her (well, the whole damn school can not stand you). She uncovers surprisingly how to fit everyone and make them like them. In addition, she makes the man fall upside down in her love. Then comes the choice, where you must choose between skiing and hockey. She chooses hockey and then goes to the skiers, and she will be in the Olympic team. There is no real surprise there. <br /> <br /> This film was completely predictable. You know what will happen before you see it. It was so terrible that I almost failed, and by the time I finished seeing him, I had a terrible headache and a desire to shoot myself to see this nonsense. You do not see this unless you are under the age of ten, or really love tween crappy movies.
