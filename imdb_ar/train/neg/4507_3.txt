Despite the overall pleasing conspiracy and expensive production one wonders how the director can make a lot of clumsy cultural mistakes. Where was the Japanese wardrobe and advisers? Not on salaries, it seems. <br /> <br /> My Japanese girlfriend laughed loudly at some of the cultural absurdity I saw unfolding before her eyes. In a subsequent conversation, she said: "Imagine a Finnish filmmaker making a Finnish film about the American Civil War using Swedish blond representatives as a union army and French confederates, and worst of all is to imagine Scarlett O'Hara crying in a long skirt missing from the collar and athletic hairstyle 1950. Perhaps not Some people in Finland realize that the hoop skirt was "missing the ring" or to recognize Jane Mansfield's strange hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .... and be laughing in the hallways ... the excellent story and the photography would be cursed. /> <br /> So ... I was watching the diary of the army It is the subject of the film! Hollywood is amazing in its view of shortsightedness in filmmaking, it often gets big money in its right while leaving the details that film polish Wrongly wrong I thought that the "last Samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad a good film on Japan could be.The memoirs of the Geisha are both better embarrassing and worse at the same time.
