Frankly I'm not joking even when I say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! This movie does not contain a single ounce of originality in its imaginary dialogue or starkly stolen storyline. I can not even begin to count the number of things in this movie that have been clearly transferred from "Omen" and other films like him. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this film is actually one of the devil's disciples that sent to guide and protect the devil's spawn ..... Is this sound very much like Mrs. Bayluck to anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage was the first to burn the child on the ground only a few months after it was adopted, as in the "Omen". But fortunately one priest survived the fire and survived severe burns all over his body .... Another coincidence ?????? More importantly, the burned priest remains in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls, like the priest in "Omen" which contains pages of the Bible on walls like wallpaper. Please do not make me begin to draw comparisons between the end of this film and the "Omen" for you because as I mentioned above, there is much to be mentioned here.
