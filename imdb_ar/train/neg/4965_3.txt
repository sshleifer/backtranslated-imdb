For such a great classic tale, and the setting (location), Grindel was disappointing. As a writer, he blamed the scenario, which was lacking in extreme tension. The club story model is useful and would provide a new look at literary classics. For some strange reasons they were dropped early. To know that this has been shot in 21 days, tells me "rushed" and this unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can hold CGI, but the text has to shake, and this was too slow, blurred and lacks drama. I blame them for the actors but ... since I know writing more than acting, I will choose my colleague.
