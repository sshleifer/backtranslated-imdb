You get 5 books together, each of them writes a different story with a different genre, then tries to get one of them out. It's a movement, it's an adventure, it's science fiction, it's Western, it's chaos. Sorry, but this movie stinks completely. 4.5 is given a desirable high rating. However, such films make me think I can write movies, and I can hardly write.
