A stupid and just and strange film about some children who get shocked when Santa discovers is not real (???). He grows up and becomes a grown man (Brandon Maggart) prepares lists of hooligans. On Christmas Day, he settles down and starts killing hooligans - dressed in Santa uniforms of course. <br /> <br /> The boring and deadly Santa movie is bad. If you are looking for Gore, it is not here. Only a few murders are displayed, and they are not so much counterfeit. Most of the film has only Brandon Maggart talking to himself and becoming crazy slowly. The script is vulgar, and the representation is terrible and leads to its end that prompted me to stare at the TV. Seriously, I had to return the tape and watch it again to make sure I did not grumble! Really really bad end. <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas flick hire a "Black Christmas" (original 70s --- not an awesome new edition). Avoid this one at all costs.
