This is the worst film I have ever seen. I was getting up and leaving in tape 4 but I hung out. I now consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Be realistic, my people! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit paintings? I thought the main actor (George Calle) was particularly incompetent. Apart from bad camera behavior and enthusiasm, I thought of using 9/11 as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, all around the screen near you" shameful and timeless for the victims of September 11. Using a phone call from Larsson's wife, Sarah, who was supposed to be one of the terrorist planes she was carrying that day, was appalling. The vibration of the camera did not make me sick, but that cold hearted trick was also.
