Crimly Insane 2 is included on the new DVD from Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, which is very good, because when I saw a film and knew there was a sequel (especially something as mysterious as this) I was always curious. I now felt curious and curious and will not see this again. Most CI2 is only "past memories" of the CI, the footage of Ethyl asleep, remember cherished memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13, she was released from Napa (I wonder if she will see The Cramps while she is there?) And was sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady whom Ethel immediately calls Grandma. All of this was filmed with a video camera, so the picture and sound are rather pathetic, but complete with a few Rolls. Of course, Ethyl is doing her job, sending someone with her to the food, especially the man who is experiencing an act of chaos and swallowing sweets. Also, you have to wonder which house is halfway to the killers they have a large staircase filled with sharp knives in the kitchen marking mice under the kitchen sink. I think it's all a matter of misleading "confidence." If you liked or did not like criminal madness, in both cases there is no good reason to see this except out of curiosity. One wonders why makers are so bothered. 2 of 10.
