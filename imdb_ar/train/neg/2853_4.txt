Vic (Richard Dreyfus) is the head of the mob, leaves a mental institution, and returns to his world of gangsters. How can the director cast with Richard Dreyfus, Ellen Parkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very wonderful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Haines, Kyle McClellan, Bert Reynolds and Billy Idol and wasting such lost time? This comedy movie is not funny, its a constellation in the cast. My four vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Prazer em Matar-te!" ("Fun to kill you!") <br /> <br />
