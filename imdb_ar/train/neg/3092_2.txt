If movies like Ghoulies rip Gremlins, the Hobgoblins will go down to a new level and get rid of trash like Ghoulies. These furbies have hardly any animations of schemas to achieve delusions (involving sexual fantasies of basically appalling characters - oh joy), but what it has to do with anything is to guess anyone, except to allow the director to manipulate his oddity with an apprentice. They show it in the eighth circle of hell, one of the suspects. There is no real conspiracy - just "Orcs - kill!" And weak attempts at humor and a light attempt to impress the public.
