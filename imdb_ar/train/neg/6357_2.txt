I am so disappointed. This film left me feeling like I was out of my time and mental energy. Here was the ideal Woody Allen again: Manhattan's upper-class neuroscientists discuss whether they will deceive their wives or not. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen the story from you ten times already. Where did you go? You need to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since I became a hero - and you need to change with it. <br /> <br /> There are more interesting and funny scenarios where you can apply your brand of anxiety and nervousness - why not try it instead of rephrasing the same old point over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project that will appear, he does not do anything to me - because now I have come to expect the old standby: the couple who get tired of each other and end up cheating. Disappointed and big in age, old. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to regain his fans, he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not insult.
