I'm sure this was the worst film ever produced. If you can not make a 13-year-old boy laugh at the ridiculous humor, you have to give up comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable muzzles (some of them are racist jokes) and jokes are very unknown. Do not forget the scene in which the leading doctor tells the rabbit that he has died and is pregnant (while writing this, I can not believe that this was actually a movie scene). The man runs to a dead rabbit on the doctors' desk and tries to give him a mouth. ROTFLMAO! Not! The punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I'd be in the lead". Ha ha ha ha ha ........ ........
