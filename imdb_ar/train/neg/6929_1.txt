I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. I am an open-minded man after all and we were given good reviews for some bad clicks. As the end of the credits rolled onto this one I looked for meaning and something nice to say. Here he says: "This film was short with mercy." That's all I got. <br /> <br /> Well, okay. The collections and visuals were well done and the music helped in the life of the asylum but the film was painful to watch the film and the endless dialogue about the good pictures. I found myself laughing at this film, but the way you laugh at your best friend who embarrassed himself in front of a big crowd. <br /> <br /> By the time of the "chicken dance" in the end, I just decided to be stuck and rolled with the film and let the objects fall where they fall. I do not know what he could have saved this movie. The acting was not bad and seemed to have a budget, but there was no way to make it viewable; nor even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have lit a spark or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film. In either case, I do not watch this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say to myself "At least I was not in 'Dr. TAR dungeon for torture ... I'm better than these guys."
