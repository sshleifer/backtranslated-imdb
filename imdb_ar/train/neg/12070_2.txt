I happened to have purchased one of the "Legacy of Horror" 50 movie packages and do you think I'm still looking to find a good horror movie. Sometimes you find someone like the Devil's Messenger, The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock movies (some are not scary, but only because Hitchcock has set some horrors and suspense) but at other times they seem to be playing movies like The Island Monster Because they can not accept the fact that it is easy to forget them and they must be. <br /> <br /> So we're open to Westing. The cruel and cruel father of Karadin (the outstanding feature of this matter) died and left his legacy to his sons and servants who still hated them. Carradine performs well enough as always, but it is left essentially in the audio recording sequence and the flashback sequence, which makes us sit in modest / terrible performances. The rest cast either overact or underact the scenes. Since this film was independent in the 1970s, lighting and effects are very limited. It's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what's going on in some scenes. Some representatives, such as Igor, make an effort at least, and I am ashamed to admit a kind of ultimate laugh mainly for the great stupidity but with some minor happiness that they have pushed some version of evolution into otherwise, But not enough to improve the quality of the film. You are not meant to like characters because they are either selfish, cruel or psychotic, but it takes them to a whole new level and makes many of them inaccessible. The death scenes are very bad and the suspense is not really there. It proves that you may enjoy 20 "Chilling" movies with movies like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of Hororor's with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead. This is the best avoided.
