Hello everyone ... <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this movie at all. The basic plot is that the man (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there, things started going badly for all of them. <br /> <br /> I think the story alone (written by the actor who plays Brandon, though I may be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acting accordingly. The Killer Clown is a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being an obscure, obscure predator, but most of all, we provide instead a clownish clown who sings nursery schools and seems to be going through a minor midlife crisis. The only thing that justifies writing this comment is the sex scenes and anything that was there in the film (the quality of the film prompted me to get some fun from such things). <br /> <br /> In short, this film falls under every possible standard. Admittedly, I shared some beer with an intimate friend while watching it, so we managed to gather some relative entertainment value from this film, so it is fair to mention that S.I.C.K was only shy of two ratings. However, in fact, (and with the benefit of hindsight), the classification of one star is more than the legitimacy of the film. <br /> <br /> One star out of ten.
