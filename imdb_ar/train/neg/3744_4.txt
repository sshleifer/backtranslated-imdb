This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamond's theory of "guns, germs and steel," explaining how Europeans dominated most of the world. <br /> <br /> The version you watched from this documentary came on two discs covering 3 hours. I think it was possible to provide information within 20 minutes. There are quite useless scenes: Professor Jared Diamond watches the birds through the binoculars. Professor Jared Diamond fails to use the bow and arrow properly. Professor Jared Diamond shoots a poorly loaded muzzle. Was this documentary supposed to be a hero from "Professor Jared Diamond?" This part of the documentary was so bad, it may be a parody. The worst was when the diamonds appeared as he collapsed and cried as he roamed the malaria ward at an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "guns, germs and steel." BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" are said about 100 times. "Can guns, germs and European steel take them out of this difficult situation? When he finally comes to work, his theory is equally interesting and boring. Indigenous Europeans have invaded other lands, because they have precise weapons and blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans are enjoying the advantages of an invasion are interesting, but the coverage is thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as European as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I know that already. If you are racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me of its humble use of the original tools. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the target audience for this documentary. Children may enjoy this more than I do. I have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
