This film was supposed to depict the bachelor degree "man of Lad" who was ready and ready to settle permanently. However, I did not care about his mission of stability, because I did not care about his personality. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw. He did not have any class, or charisma. He had to have at least a way about himself made the ladies weak in the knees other than playing saxophone, but to no avail. Just because a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention that the things he did to attract the attention of a married woman who fell in love within five minutes of knowing her were ridiculously ridiculous. Does this man have any shame at all? If he had been hired, he would stop doing stupid things and was supposed to be more attractive as a character, but unfortunately, his character was nice and boring. It could have been as simple as its ordinary voice, rather than a poor British accent that might sometimes fade through the film. <br /> <br /> The only character I cared about was the fish and the frog. Now these two have chemistry! Academy nominations for both? STAT! Craft holes, lack of personal development, terrible representation, unnecessary drama, vulgar moments ... What a mess movie.
