Imagine transforming the American national anthem into a caricature. You can throw a couple of cute animals, some horrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you'll find yourself with a replica of this movie almost. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing that when I was younger; I made my mom rent it from the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not too bad, it's certainly that any Marxist watching will surely have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America you will not like this movie.
