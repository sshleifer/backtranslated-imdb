After I searched for this film dramatically and low, I found it already when I was less predictable, I play on the Sundance channel very early one morning. Why I searched endlessly for a small draft of the vanity made by Chuck Barris during the last years of the TV show, I have no idea. The film is simply put horrible. The script part that deals with the week that is. Of course, the highlight of the film is to see the real performers who were "too hot for television" or were rejected for one reason or another. This part is still terrible, but it's very bad and it's fun in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for for a long time do I see it again in my life? Not surprisingly! Go ahead and see "MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH" better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or look for older versions of the actual view. The girl was acting so there was licking the sucker provocatively in a fun way, but having to endure seeing Jay B. Morgon's flicker of the public has made me in all probability sterile. Too late, I'm very happy because this was a huge event, because if it were a big success, there could have been "The Beauty Show Movie" for $ 1.98 and my friends would certainly be coming to the end of the world. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D
