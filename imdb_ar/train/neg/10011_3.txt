This film revolves around the accompaniment of a male involved in an investigation into a murder that occurred in the circle of wives of powerful men. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie "The Walker" would be exciting and attractive, but I was very wrong. Slow and painful speed, even after 40 minutes of film did not happen much. Seriously, the first hour can be intensified in ten minutes. This is how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that he lacks any excitement or motion scenes increases boredom. It is shocking that the scenes of the argument are very clear and devoid of emotion. Perhaps it is because of the extreme upper lip of the upper social class? <br /> <br /> It is sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite this powerful cast. Blame the poor plot the worst pace.
