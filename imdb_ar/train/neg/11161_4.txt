"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Regira, Hector Jimenez, and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: "PG-13" (to do some hard work, hard humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you want (I know some people who despise it endlessly), but I've always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite "It was a funny film - not the smartest brick on the wall, but it's a funny film, though. Jack Black is also a very funny man - sometimes it is annoying, yes, and greatly irritated by the audience of teenagers who adore him practically, but he is funny. Rarely was there a comedy Jack Black I did not enjoy it to some extent. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hesse, writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite" and Jack Black will collaborate together on a film about a Spanish monk who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot looked a little thin. Unfortunately, my reservation turned to the fall of the entire film. The plot, if performed as a play on some programs like "Saturday Night Live" or even "Mad TV", would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs out much over the course of an approximate hour and a half and almost drops this comedy with one humor. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican convent and became a religious man from the Lord. Feeling out of the whole monastery, Nacho (the black), now the monastery chef, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's money reached its lowest level ever, Nacho decided to join the wrestling tournament so he could win the prize money and provide good food to the orphanage in the monastery. This plot looks sweet and caring. It seems to be the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did with Rock School after all. Well, it is my displeasure that this plot is almost completely destroyed by the offensive and massive humor that is far from the heart of the film. It's once again Hollywood's way of showing their feeling that teenagers will only understand the bad jokes and stupid humor? Of course, as far as I know, this may be the general thought of teenagers, as many of them seem to enjoy this film. Watching a fat woman roll like a mouse on the ground will make people laugh, but do not expect to get a prize for putting it in the film. Seven years old can be the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances at "Nacho Libre" are really good. Black Jack proves again that he is too hilarious and he can even make the most stupid, useless lines ever placed on comic paper. Unfortunately, this was not enough for him. He gave him nothing to continue, and the only reason for any of his jokes was because of him. I have never seen or heard about De La Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the prettiest women I have ever seen. You just clicked on the role and it worked wonderfully. Hector Jimenez, who plays as a mature Naco partner, kept Escuelito, laughing constantly. He did a great job and was very effective when he participated in the work of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. It was awesome. The rest of the staff did their work. It is regrettable that they were wasted in such a sub-film. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" not only works. The plot stretched too thin. The heart of all this is polluted with malignant humor and amazing jokes that do not work. I rarely laughed too much, and if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the acting team. This brings me to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": Yes, Cast. This cast was very good, because there was no better word, they were on it. They all clicked, they had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After the film "Napoleon Dynamite" was kept by Jared Hess and enjoyed the entire film, I was surprised to find myself much bored with Nacho Libre. Something has been lost here and I have not yet understood what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good film, but since it is worthless at all. There is a small reason to watch, just to see the work of Jack Black. However, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, you should avoid this movie like Plague. I love Black, but I finished this movie with this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: Yikes! This is a follow-up to Jared Hess amazingly disappointing for the hysterical "Dynamite Napoleon". <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 4/10 (C +)
