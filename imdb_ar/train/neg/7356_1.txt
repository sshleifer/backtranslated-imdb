I entered into this, as it was at the beginning, in the afternoon where I was at home with a touch of flu - otherwise I missed it. Maybe that's better. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Cross and Jay Thomas - both of them very good artists - and I thought this might be worth a look. It has proved to be somewhat, but only because it is one of those amazing stories that dazzle it. <br /> <br /> Zoe McClellan has little to recommend her talents, except for Jayne Mansfield or Loney Anderson, who looks like a bosom. Unfortunately, her skill in acting - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis as compared. <br /> <br /> The white rat for the small walnut case, the owner's cat, the young walnut case that drove the owner and restraint in her house, and a handful of doophus (including the young nut case) running around a bio-risk facility, the result is ridiculous. I have waited at least some elements of the scene or conspiracy to contain at least a little realism, credibility or the ability to stir some sympathy - but it proved to be useless.
