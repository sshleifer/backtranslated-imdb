Well, I was taken out of the Woody Allen film I left half an hour later (I realize the moral fragility of commenting on a film I saw less than half, but I hope you understand why). In essence, it became clear very early that we would be shielded from the screen by using: a script that defines its entrails as if with bullet points; actors were all trying to be characters from Hannah and her sisters (except Clavy Sivini) and were badly directed to do so; I sat around, just to have something to photograph but the chat and actor delivered. drama? None; it is partially listed, but the procedure does nothing to develop a dramatic position. <br /> <br /> You may have left early in this case, but by that time I decided to oppose another hour and a half - clone Lenner Allen. Scenario has funny moments? I went almost full on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (hooked again, do you!)? But there is little speed to let them fly carelessly, as is better. Worse than this there is no liquidity. The words of this wooden film make the forest look like jelly: the confined discussion in the cafe is the most obvious. The only thing to be done through the numbers is potted review? 10/02.
