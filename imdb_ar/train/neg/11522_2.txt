First, do not be a personal title is the main character in the film. He is the companion of the leader of worship. The actor who portrayed Igor imagines that loud screaming, hysterical laughter and crooked smile while tapping your eyes, would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling (because he never spoke of his voice) loudly. He was also saying one idiot hardcore. For example, when the worship leader kills one of his followers with a buzzer, when he sees this, he yells "Paul! No Paul! Why did you do that? I could have cut it clean! In another scene, Igor told the victim she would have to "get her own surgical instruments because at the moment it was time to work." Apart from the bad behavior, the end was illogical because, as the story accumulated little of its steam to its climax, Igor, who gets the bow on his head and the rest of his fellow killers, is shown again twice to kill the remaining "good guys". The film offers no explanation for this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? The bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could return to the moments when I lost sight of this.
