I found this film tedious, uninteresting and not very interested in the end of the "optimistic" hasty and theft did not match the overall story. The follow-up of these characters during a weekend of terrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news is not just my idea of ​​an interesting and enjoyable film. I was tired of the "one observation" theme and could not wait to finish - in fact it almost stopped halfway. The entire film seemed meaningless and wandering, and the characters were mostly frustrating and unpleasant, although the acting was good. Small film with small ambitions and small attraction - Sorry, but did not make it with me, I love good little movies! This one just did not shake, although I kept watching it with hope and confidence that it would be. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on the "Top 10" list. I highly recommend watching "The House of Sand" instead - now there's a good little movie!
