First seen on 28/2/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - A DVD copy I saw "3 Days of the Condor" - so it was a CIA drama full of reruns made for the break movie . The story hypothesis revolves around about 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group being murdered by Robert Redford, code name = Condor, being left. Who killed them and why? This is what Redford tries to discover while trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. Along the way, Faye Donaway's characters participate in the engagement, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then help him in the end after a little time of love. This is one of a bunch of innocent guys in running stories but this does not have much of a thrill. Flat offers do not help and the result does not lead to the conclusion of the transaction to the public as well. Although there is a good way out in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the shows are not as it should be, so the film is not as it should be.
