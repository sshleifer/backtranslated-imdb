Drake is about three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festivals (or something). All the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they do not know is that there is a creeping animal that loves killing ... <br /> <br /> Yawning. The film "horror" dull, meaningless, completely stupid. Bach and her friends are certainly beautiful but the film itself is boring! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are empty all the way. The ultimate "Revelation" is laughably predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested on the road. There are some unexplained female nudity but this is not enough to save this. Boring, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). 1 along the way.
