The cover of the box makes this film look really good, and do not be fooled. The scattered university came out in 1984 which was another good year of horror, but sucked this film. The characters are very annoying. The only teacher is cool. There is no conspiracy to this film, who will produce this hell of the film? <br /> <br /> The spoilers come forward <br /> <br /> The teacher dies in this, and he was a female, we all know that we must have a female alive, if you break the rules, you should do so In a good fit of horror do not miss this
