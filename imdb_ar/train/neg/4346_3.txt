Why oh why people take good materials and feel the need to change them somehow? After reading the book on which this film is based two years ago, I can say that there is little of the original book. I went to this movie with low expectations - I knew he would feel crazy TV - but he failed to achieve these goals. <br /> <br /> This is not a prepaid package - the only relationship between it and the origin is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is a story of a completely different character given the same name. They have spit out completely in the face of all the Carlito Road fans there; add insult to injury by portraying Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial role in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that after this film, no other film will be produced to address the original material untouched by Carlito's Way - something I really wanted to see. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books in addition to interviews with fantastic non-fiction material that could have made a great biography of the biggest hidden figure in Australia, and instead made a fun film about a freaky but strange person. The crook was a pathetic little time (although Eric Pana's performance was immediate). We will not be able to see the real rise and fall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> The three stars are, given that it is just a stand-alone click, is not horrible - there are some decent shows (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but he can be good at other roles) and the story is not too bad. Combs up puffy fit course. But they misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I'm a non-fiction fan) - which is what the original film and books got right (after being written by the lawyer at the time and now Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The truth is that it is not stand-alone - it's probably the most disappointing collection ever filmed.
