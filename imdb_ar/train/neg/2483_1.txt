Turkey is indescribably misunderstood, a mixture of anti-Nazi music (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, a parody with a big, big problem: it's a deadly deceit. Besides the number one number plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk casting. Jane Wilder (the star and the participant) is trying hard in everything: he plays a romantic role (in appearance and age!) And Allen Allen should create a club for older comedians who do not know the mirror), trying to be moving, funny, Dance, and succeed in nothing !! A long shot of his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> I thought for a while that I was suffering from myopia, because everyone in the movie is still saying that Cherry Jones is this very hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is such a handsome and impossible horse! The man who plays the role of secretary Claire Bloom is a thin actor wearing glasses short and sexy chair and is the passion of two adorable ladies !! Mike Starr, the most incompetent and efficient character I have ever seen, deserves to be ranked among the 10 most repulsive performances in the history of a modern film. The most sad observation is the vision of Claire Bloom and Barbara Scowa, who is brilliantly wrong and aggressively wasted. At least I hope both stars pay their bills back home (and then fired their clients) with this flipping. No wonder that acting miraculously returned Scowa to Germany after she saw what Hollywood did in her shop !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make a really bad movie from a really bad film with the director's berserk appearance, study this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
