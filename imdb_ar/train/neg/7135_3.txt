I am sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that Enzo will be able to really keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The weight-bearing capacity of the S7 will be very large. The S7 has a power ratio of 3.93 lbs / hr while an average of 4.61 lbs / hp. The low end S7s is also much better. We are sorry for Ferrari fans but the Saleen team made it much better. <br /> <br /> As with other parts of this film, I have to say that it is below the required level to be pathetic. The story is too weak. Representation in this lemon is worse than daytime soap. <br /> <br /> I can say that as far as research in passive psychology is, it is a kind of gemstone. This film is nothing if not a clear definition of narcissism and social injustice. All about these rich villains springing from their rocks while showing only the traces of artificial remorse for all innocent road users who cause injury or death as well. <br /> <br /> I can not give the movie "One Star" rating because it did not force me to actually get out of the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with blue eyes is deadly as the leading female prevents her from being too bad .... although there is no way she can be singled out by her on the cover of "Variety". <br /> Note: The person playing Jason is SOOOOO, the ski version of James Vanderbeek.
