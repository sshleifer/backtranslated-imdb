Well, frankly, I do not see why everyone thinks this is very cool. It really does not. There were two good things that came out of this film. 1. Jack's performance, it was very good I can put in it. 2. Danny's performance, was good. No other so after he became very stupid. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking of drafting "Chile" as Wendy? It was very bad. She looked the same every time she felt scared. The problem with this film was the end. I would have respected her more if Kubrick would have ended it differently. Most of all it was just a stupid movie. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So do not see the film read the book will be better off. 10/03.
