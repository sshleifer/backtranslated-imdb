I had been exposed to this movie for a relationship class at my school. As I reckon it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Although he tries to be original by focusing on the teenage father rather than the mother who shows the problems that the father will face. It had an interesting aspect but it did not live up to its authenticity because of the fact that nothing else in the film was original. Our main character that has an older sister that you like in every other movie like this has something against him, we have a stay at home mom that you expect a lot and when he gives more you feel insulted and leave him in the dust, then we have a father who always went. Then the side of our parents girls who want everything and expect them to be perfect in whatever they do. To a story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good representation of the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. All about this happened in the cliches, the nerd starts school in school with a girl, they meet and have sex then our little boy thrives. Maybe it would have been better if the writing had been better and the acting was improved, I've got more seriously than the passion of Leatherface and its portrayal than I was doing from any actor in this film and that's too bad to see like Leatherface Films are crap and acted horribly . So far the only interesting pregnancy film I've seen is Juno. So far, the comic side of this dangerous attitude has proved to be more entertaining while still giving the same message. As I said, the idea was original. Most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but this film chose not to focus instead on the drama the father performed, but once again the originality did not save the film from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to reproduce this film with a better actor and a better writer or just making another similar film because this movie was lost.
