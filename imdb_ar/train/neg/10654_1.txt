Big hair, big breasts, bad music, huge security pin ....... These are the words to describe this terrible film. I love cheesy horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but this has to be the worst ever. The plot is thin and ridiculous, the representation is abhorrent, the text is completely funny (the best is the final confrontation with the cop and how he worked to figure out who the killer is - it's terribly written), the funny funny clothes and the same scales, The breasts are bouncing, the men are wearing those shirts that adorn their bellies (pleading that the men were actually wearing it !!), and the music just blending the tune is turned on and on again ... in almost every scene, there is trivial music, thugs and paramedics ... And the gym is still not closed because of the loss of life !! No matter what the joke, this is a really bad film, and its only charm is to look at the disaster of the 1980s and enjoy the old laugh over how bad everything was at the time.
