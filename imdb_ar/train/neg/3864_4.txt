Just Jason Lee normal film, there were some parts of the film that was funny. The task of this step is to live a life on the edge that I think. These are the kinds of movies that I think the 14-year-old girls are watching at night parties. It was a very good film. It's one of those movies you have in the back ground and searching for from time to time to anything that attracts attention. I think the Julia and Selma Blair clips are a good mix and want to see them in a movie with a good story and a plot. It's just a kind of boy meets a girl's movie. This is the perfect film they show on central comedy. I'm glad I did not see that movie in the theater, I'd be angry. But I think that's why I have not seen it in theater.
