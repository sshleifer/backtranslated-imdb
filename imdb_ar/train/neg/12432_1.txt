This is the worst rush in the Home Alone movies I've ever seen! Watch the first and second part, but do not let anyone say that this is better than the first! I mean, really, you do not make a film, then make a complement with the same characters and actors, and then make another complement in different characters and representatives! I mean it was good if it was not "Home Alone", but they made it Home Alone. Culkin is very old, so it is supposed to stop making disciples! Well, this movie makes me know! Buy part 1 and 2.
