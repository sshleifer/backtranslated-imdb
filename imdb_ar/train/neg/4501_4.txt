True, the setting in Paris is wonderful. The actors are okay. The story is a twisted moral play. Are you supposed to say that if you want a bad enough person, is it okay to hurt others along the way? In a true love story, you want a less vulgar than a man who is bored with his wife and ready to drown his family, and the woman who agrees to encourage him to do so. So what if they were looking decent and if Karen Allen showed her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and deniable. The story may well be "getting what you deserve". I give it number 4, only for quick scanning capability through "male attention" bits.
