The final result (average of the various classic cinematic qualities - acting, visualization, creativity, yield, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> " Atlantis: The Lost Empire "came out a few years ago it seemed like a new and bold trend in animated Disney cartoons. However, it comes just one year after the innovative "New Emperor Groove" and semi-genius, and represents a step back in Disney's release of the recurring Disney Formula. I'm a big fan of Disney's long-lived animated films. We must see them all like it or hate it. "Atlantis" is a mobile bounce of "20,000 underwater patrols" and live science fiction adventures in the 1950s and 1960s. The problem is that this version barely contains one original idea. It sounds like a remake of something, more than a real Disney remake (Tarzan, the Notre Dame Hunchback). The characters are nothing more than vulgar passages of the usual suspects who usually fill this kind of film (eccentric mechanics, general-general, tough tough woman). Behind Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rurke (Garner) cast are abhorrent. The film also suffers from its short speed. Instead of embodying it in an epic story, Disney often contends in a short run time that usually outperforms opportunities for development ... suspense, characters and anything really. They are pushing us into this new and wonderful world, and hardly inviting us to get explosions. Sometimes, the difficult pace is confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark, depressing and cheap. This thing seems to be slapping cartons on Saturday morning. Let's hope they do not forget that traditional two-dimensional animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant" among others proved it. <br /> <br /> Cons: Images, tempo, lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Pros: It is probably the coolest death scene for Disney the villain in a long time. They highlight creativity in the film.
