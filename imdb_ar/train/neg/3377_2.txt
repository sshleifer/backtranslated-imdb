The Broadway Musical, "A Chorus Line" is arguably the best music in the theater. It is about the experiences of people who live for dancing; their joys and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer tests in parts of a chorus line on Broadway, but what comes out of each of them is stories about how to live their lives in finding dancing as a rest period. <br /> <br /> Although the film version does not reflect any passion or beauty of a theatrical performance, it is arguably the worst adaptation of Broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any passion for dance at all. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake has been made in giving the post of director to Sir Richard Attenborough, who showed his direction of touch and the right step for Gandhi. Why does anyone in his right mind ask the epic director to direct a music that takes place in a rather narrow place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater with no real collections and limited changes in fashion. It is the least glamorous of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity is its glory. However, this does not translate well into the film, and no one really thought that would be so. For this reason, the film should have taken us into the lives of these dancers, and must leave the theater and the testing process. The singers could have made their songs in other environments, and even introduced past memories for the first time in ballet or jazz or clicking. Heck, they could have danced Broadway in their vivid imagination. However, this film did not invent any atom of imagination, as Attenborough's complete disregard for the dance and the presentation itself was clear in its bad direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are just as strange as the dancers tell a story by director Michael Douglas whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas's character is volatile about the choice of extending his sympathetic ear, and has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" was removed - a break-up number that brought the dancers back to adolescence - and replaced with the dreaded "Surprise" song that Oscar was nominated for. Adding insult to injury, "Surprise" simply recounts the same story as "Hello Love" but without intelligence or lamentation. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to see this movie unless you want a lesson in what not to do when you move the Broadway show to the movie. If you want to see a movie version of this show, the closest thing is the wonderful Bob Claus movie "All That Jazz". While Fosse's daughter was in "A Chorus Line", it was Fosse who had to be involved, as a director. He knew what to do with this article, which deserves much more respect than this sad effort.
