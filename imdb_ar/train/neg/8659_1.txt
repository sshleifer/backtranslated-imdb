There are some things I can never understand. Such a film. What if you were to create a truly polygon model Dino and alligator really looking at Maya and then go ahead to cut and paste it into a video clip of amateur screaming people and getting eaten the same? How can anyone even believe that the completely fake fake dinocroc CGI remover that looks completely out of place, will affect the events in this movie? I know that its budget is in the category B, and its budget is low, and all producers, except producers, can do better than making a piece of waste that nobody has seen or sat on. It just does not make sense. Are people really stupid enough to sit in this? Seemingly. Laughing? No, this thing is not worth even laughing.
