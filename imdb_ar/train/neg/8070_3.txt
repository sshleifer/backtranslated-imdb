This is not a very good film, but it is not so stinky. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so hire it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> We and GF have filmed this movie (as we think), so here: <br /> <br /> * ** The main spoilers below *** <br /> <br /> First, This movie is very simple after removing all unwanted junk in the dream state (95% of the movie.) <br /> Discard the scrap, what actually happened is this: a group of school friends go to rave one night . They leave and enter a car accident where everyone dies except Cassie and Shawn. This is a simple broken version. (That's right, I said to Sean, carry with me) <br /> <br /> Immediately after the accident, Cassie puts the hospital in the hospital between life and death until the end of the film. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called "SOUL Survivors", is not it? The mind and spirit of Cassie continue after the incident and he interacts with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 weirdos and Jude) with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls continue to do what is defined as: Annie, the raving chick, the strange killers (from the opening scene), Father Jude still helps people and so on. <br /> <br /> A long trip, I showed a lot of photos (still can not GF and much of me linked) but it all comes down to the fact that it was not time for Casey to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up in hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Shun are there. This is reality again. It's okay. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds some extra spices by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream of her in a wheelchair that is strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside Sean, and she is obviously still dealing with her painful experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we have not covered everything small, but feel free to send us an email if you want to. <br /> <br />
