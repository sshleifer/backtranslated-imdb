The Battlestar Gallactica was great because it had a court writing, a great look, excellent actors, and fun stories ... and yes, wonderful men and women were running inside and outside uniforms. Just lazy. Lazy writing. The actors smoke the storm to give them a "personality". Outdoor sequences destroy the feeling that you are somewhere else (yes, this is Ford Focus sitting in the background). Lots and lots of teenage anxiety. A lot of naked women are gears (but in the background, which will certainly be cut for serial) and a symbolic sight of some men in towels. Did not draw the attention of any representatives except for Paul Walker. After an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> So what exactly is supposed to bring me back? Science Fiction? It's awfully light on it. The actors? Besides the good role of Paul Walker, there is not much attention here. There is not even any "hotties" in the cast, except maybe Esai, although for the younger group, he is older, since he is over 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I expect the very short term for that as a series unless they have already sharpened the SciFi pencils and start making this over OC on another planet.
