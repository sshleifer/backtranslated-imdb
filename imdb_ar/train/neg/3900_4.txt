As someone who read the book, I can say that this is less than the great American version of Gwyneth Paltrow. There are many reasons for this. First, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, he has flaws, not the easiest one he likes - but the viewer must not start to be disdainful. Secondly, Mr. Knightley is wrong. His bosom and sadness in this version is more suited to modify Bronte or Gaskell than Austin, and casts the mood of the whole issue "out". Thirdly, Samantha Morton is so powerful that she can not be relegated to Harriet's role; why was she forced to look sick? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - does not look as though she will be carried out by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the temple was demolished and scenes were cut. In the end, when Emma decides she likes Mr. Knightley, it seems quite puzzling because this novel has not been properly presented throughout the film. Fifthly, what exactly happened, in Ms. Elton's tone? She moved from her beginning as an American actress trying to suppress her own tone at first, halfway up, and then back to English. Finally, this is dragged in the end. The book and the large version of the film end with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightley. This version continues confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the concert. <br /> <br /> All in all, a random attempt. Read the book or rent a copy of Paltrow instead
