It's unbelievable that it has managed to be terrible on many levels. The script, representation, output and selection of actors are all appalling. Fashion collections and pseudo-medieval language are also absolutely awful. In a strange way, I really enjoyed this movie, once I accept it will not be good. It seems a shame that people spend too much time and effort to produce something very poor, while they could really make something fit (although it is not very reasonable!), But instead we are dealing with a feeling of nausea and cheese The tale of dragons and horsemen lacks any of the witches found in other fictional films. Let's just hope that the Lord of the Rings a little better! Oh, haircut David Theois makes him look like a man. Yes it is!
