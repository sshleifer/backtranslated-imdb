I found it a real task to sit in this movie. The audio track was not the best and some dialects made it difficult to understand what was said. There was not much to trigger the plot and the work simply stopped and there was a long period of conversations that seemed strange to the film. These conversations turned into family groups and the controller was left to try to compile the common thread that linked them together. I rarely write a movie that low and do it in this case because the entire viewing experience left me thinking "how" and "why do I waste my time watching this"
