They built this kind of fantasy as a man from Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and Sundance, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe to play with high-end talent, and young married women bored of wealthy old people. Well, there are a lot of legends about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well-documented facts, which still leave room for artistic creativity to produce a good historical drama. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, nor the myths of Arthur, not Beowulf, and not a person with so many clouds in the last several centuries that any recreation in their lives and times is a 99% guess. It's only a couple of times old. My grandparents were already in school age when the hang was hanged. <br /> <br /> So I'm silly because I thought this film was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. Having recently read Peter Carrey's excellent novel "The Real History of the Kelly Gang," I was eagerly anticipating this in a similar context. But no, the fact is that Kelly was very ironic in 1970 from Kelly was probably closer to reality, and a better film in general, who does not say much about it. <br /> <br /> Said it cost me so only two bucks to hire a DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's just because some nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
