This woman, who works as a photographer, returns to the house and bathe, where this hole is discovered in the ceiling. I went to find her neighbor above her pictured. This film could have been a wonderful plot, but then the conspiracy drains no hope. The problem with this film is that every ten seconds, someone snorts heroin. If they take out scenes in which someone is making fun of heroin, it will be a good film. Every time I thought that a scene was somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have a lot of drug abuse in one film. Attracted attention from the main plot and a big story about a photographer. Lesbian stuff did not bother me. I was looking for a film about art. I found a movie about drug abuse.
