As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of the young director. I doubt whether this is the work of an ordinary man who happens to love movies or if this is the work of a film student, as there is a reference to the Oporto School of Arts in the final credits. <br /> <br /> However, director Ricardo Pinheo demonstrates in this film a complete lack of awareness of some basic ideas about cinema. what is the movie? How do you tell a story? It does not matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when studying cinema is how to tell the story. You know that, as in novels, in movies, you must also write your story in three works: introduction, development, and outcome. You know that your story must contain a protagonist and an antagonist and that there must be a climax. You know this is true for 3 hours epic, for a regular movie, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You also know that there can be levels of dexterity in your approach to the academic structure, and that in the end, you can even disassemble them. <br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER gives us its main character, and then the movie ends - the entire film looks like the introductions of characters in Jeunet's AMÃ‰LIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or a technical film, so you can not even try to justify not respecting the academic structure. You expect to tell a story, and this does not happen. Even worse, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; one without a real goal. Do not raise a point, or at least, not valid. The point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The picture positions are quite simple and their approach is mannered. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot of this shortcut. The film begins with a fairly good credit sequence, and you quickly realize that you are seeing something of better production value than the ordinary Portuguese film. I do not know the budget of this film, but thanks to the thank-you list in the end, merit should go to the production team for such good communication in a country where it is difficult to open doors to young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, along with a great score. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no conspiracy. This is a shame because it seems like a waste of production values. Barely, you can see in the regular Portuguese diversity this short diversity of locations and a lot of additions are available to enrich the story. <br /> <br /> Since the comparison may seem silly, I should refer to the BMW shorts as a good example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film that is highly conditioned by product placement and elegant cinematography.
