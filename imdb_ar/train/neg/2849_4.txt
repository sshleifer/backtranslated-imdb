This movie is compared to "The Last Detail" by some, but "Chasers" flatter more than the Interstate Interstate Highway in West Texas. Like the landscape in the desert, there is nothing that distinguishes it much, not even the fact that a prisoner is being transported by two marine escorts this time. No one in the cast comes well; with this lame scenario this is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much space to this article if he writes memoirs before, I do not think so.
