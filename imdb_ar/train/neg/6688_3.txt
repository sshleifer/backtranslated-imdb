This film is very cool, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona, and in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. Most of the plugins in the movie are then drama students from the NAU. I was a student there that year, I was learning in theater, but for some reason I did not participate in production. However, I knew many people who had this strange truth, and they could give it: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this film where two school principals, as part of their harmful rituals, have to run naked in the forest. Seen from behind in the film, they do it. The thing is that these are not actors at all, but people I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "exciting background paintings" will remain anonymous, at least for this site, unless they decide, "revealed" themselves!
