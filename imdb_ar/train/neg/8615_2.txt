This film was so bad, so old and stupid that I had to face difficult times to see it to the end. I saw this guy Rodney in Natural Born Killers and I thought it was funny as hell in it, but this movie was crap. "Jokes" were not funny, the funny people were not funny, nothing was funny about them remotely. Do not waste your time for this! The positive things on this subject were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, whom I certainly tried, but the scenario was so bad. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
