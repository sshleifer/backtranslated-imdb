After reading the other reviews of this film, I see that the high marks may be paid in the studio where the film I saw was very harsh, with wooden representation, faded text and predictive output, one of the few extra points should be the stunning scene, This film has some amazing backgrounds with great dramatic and dramatic horizons and wide open grasslands, unfortunately when the most unforgettable thing in the film is the part that appears behind the actors, this should be a warning sign of quality for the film, all in addition to an uninspired addition OK A Western type which is best avoided even at a very reasonable price.
