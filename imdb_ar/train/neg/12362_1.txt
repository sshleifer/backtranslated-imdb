I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining and you did not want to wait at PORT AUTHORTY. I went across the street and watched the worst film in my life. It was so bad, I chose to stay and watch the whole movie, and I have not seen anything else bad since then. It was 69 years old, so call me crazy. I just stayed because I could not believe it .........
