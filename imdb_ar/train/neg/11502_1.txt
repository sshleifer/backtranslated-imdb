This slow film is painful and has no plot. It conveys the lives of a group of boat crews. An honest elder is trying to get a job. There may be some social comments here, but they are confused because no one is drawing in a very sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why they contained 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I watched everything boring and built expectations for a huge refund reward. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been a good match for my tails. Anything higher than 6.5 is worth watching. <br /> <br /> My wife says that Javier Parm does not look good in this film. It's not my kind, so, it does not mean I agree a lot. <br /> <br /> He sighed. Give it 1.
