My friends and I went to this movie not knowing what to expect, but I hope for the best. When we came out, we knew little of what the plot was. If not the worst movie I have ever seen, I certainly do not recommend spending your money to see it in the theaters. Maybe you have a friend who rents to you (not even worth the rent cost, too) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When the movie is so complex that you do not know what's going on even in the last five minutes, there's really nothing to say in its defense. The acting was more appropriate than I expected from this film, and some of the shots were good, but all this was influenced by a lame plot and a bad script. <br /> <br /> Actually very bad once I went out, I bought a ticket to watch a good movie just to cleanse my mind. I recommend all of you just skip the first step and go to see a good movie instead.
