For those who want to see this movie? I would say: Go! Without narration it may be a very good documentary / film. But the music, narration and some storylines make it very difficult to watch someone who is skeptical like me. After several animals, the person feels in several seasons that animal soap is watching him. But the melodramatic view does not break for me. Moreover, if the predator is finally caught on a prey (one of the remaining exceptions), the camera will zoom out or move elsewhere. I ask myself why this happens, if they want to show reality, why cut scenes that are still stories of melodramatic fantasy? I think the moral is important to the masses of the crowd, the reason in the end: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
