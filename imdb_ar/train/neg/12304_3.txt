I watched this movie last week at some point, and I had the biggest laugh I have had in a long time. The movie plot is very stupid and twisted in a way that is poorly developed. The only additional feature that can be found anywhere in the movie is Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think this is her name) is as horrifying as the wife of a caliph who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is a stranger and his character is stupid in the first place. As if the fact that you think she has sex with her son is not enough, they throw Saks alone unnecessarily at every opportunity! End and Peak This movie is very annoying and very funny. I mean the one who wants the hell to carry a child of deception who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were in a relationship with him!
