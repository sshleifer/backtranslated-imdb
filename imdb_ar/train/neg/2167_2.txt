To Die For (1989) was just d.t.v. The feature appeared on the nasuem ad cable during the early 1990s. The only notable feature of this feature is the recent film in which Dwan Jones appeared. Other than that, there is no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like the fake chick clicks that disguise as a horror film. Vampire tired looking to love and looking at the back streets of L.A. Will he succeed or will Vlad return again as he did in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie should be great because of a series of snapshots shortly after. They are very bad and make this look like a classic. I know this is a film about vampires, but filmmakers could get used to lighting. <br /> <br /> I did not recommend it because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> said nuff?
