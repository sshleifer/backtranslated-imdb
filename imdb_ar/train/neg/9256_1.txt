Short meaningless around a bunch of nude men slapping and punching each other. This is. For 5 minutes we see this. It was filmed in black and white with a lot of quasi-naked men running around slapping each other into the awful music. Looks interesting but there is no conspiracy and truth - the inherent violence in this has become worrisome. Sex erotic also played in this matter but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people might like the avant-garde materials, but I found them incomprehensible, boring, stupid and sometimes disturbing. Really - what's the point of all this? I saw him as part of a gay shorts festival and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really hope to go to less than 1.
