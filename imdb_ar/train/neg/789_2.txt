After five minutes of watching this, you are logged in to IMDb to warn you all not to be interested in this movie ... Genre: Horror? There were moments of moderate suspense and throughout the whole movie I was thinking of myself "Something Must Happen Soon" Never Happened ... When the film ended I was very embarrassed by the writer / director and I was never one of the biggest fans of Patrick Ria. This guy just does not know how to make films After watching this unfortunate excuse for the horror flick I went from the biggest fan I would not see another of his works .. <br /> <br /> Taken through the plot summary, please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> This movie has been given to 2 actors ... it was not bad and there was no mistake they got in a bad direction ...
