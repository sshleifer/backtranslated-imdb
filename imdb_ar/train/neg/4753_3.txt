Director F. And. Mornau is stuck with wisdom with the silent film he knew well to cover the life story of the indigenous islanders in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The scenery is beautiful, and the daily activities of the island residents are interesting. The film loses momentum, when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of infected fans. The story is never interesting, although Mornau treated it well. He won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, although the award was probably the best scene. You can not really rely on DP to get shot at such a nice site.
