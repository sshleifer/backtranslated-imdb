It looks like this ... put in the DVD, and the most professional things you see in the next 90 minutes are the company logo. At this point, you know you have just been strained. <br /> <br /> People generally trust enough to assume that if something is put on a DVD, it will be a certain level - at least financially, if not creatively. But unfortunately this is not the case. The distribution companies are quite happy to collect DVD movies for amateur films and ship them directly to the stores waiting for the reassuring buyer covered by the well-designed DVD cover. The project is likely to be the leading independent horror film Kevin J. Lindenmuth, whose name may be known among genre lovers because he is responsible for many low-budget wolves - "Rage of the Werewolf". <br /> <br /> The book "Blood of the Werewolf" consists of three short stories of the Independent Werewolf, with no real connection other than their dealings with genetic changeers. The first part, "Blood reunification", largely determines the tone of everything ... A man returns to his hometown to look for a crushed girl, only to find that her autocratic grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men and for reasons somehow related to a dark family secret . This batch is poorly routed, badly oriented, and basically does not outshine what you can throw out with some friends and a home video camera. <br /> <br /> The second story, "Old Blood", may be stronger than the three and is run by Lindenmuth himself. Tells the story of a lesbian couple, one of whom is vengeful and the other wishes to grant this power. Her wish is granted, but she does not become the creature that I imagined. This short film shows that Lindemuth has more talent and experience than other filmmakers who have worked on this project, but still not enough to raise it above the level of amateur film. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have "Manbeast", where some army men run through the forest while being chased by two others.They want to kill him because he has been bitten by the monster and thinks he is dangerous, but may not be all This concept has an interesting concept, but it has been extended for a very long time, and if you do not guess what "evolution" is in the first 10 minutes, then you are probably not glamorous. Good ideas are not enough to justify spending money on something like this.After all, do you pay for a picture you can draw yourself?
