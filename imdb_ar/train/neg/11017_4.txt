Women's nightmares feed their fear of being buried alive. The cheating spouse wants her death and decides to take advantage of her phobia by gluing it in a coffin and leaving it in the basement. Of course, Queen Brink Stevens is Queen of Films. A ghastly creature. The only reason to see this unwanted flick is Michael Periman in a really small veil and two sexy scenes with Delia Sheppard. In the last 20 minutes of Brinke's bloody agitation, it's very fun to watch. Special effects eg laughable head-head really horrible. Watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect to be a stylish entertainer from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is so boring that it can not be enjoyed.
