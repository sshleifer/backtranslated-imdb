A brief review but ... <br /> <br /> In no way avoid a total 90-minute dissipation. At the end of the film I was no more wiser than what actually happened. It's full of stars (Steven Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), Philadelphia girls and some people who know vaguely, but that does not make sense, if the story has just been lost, jeez ... <br /> <br /> Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for boys and chasing Morris Minor) <br /> <br />
