Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Elm Street series Nightmare and another bad hit. I think this is related to the last part of Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get my Nightmare DVD on the Elm Street series for my birthday, so I got to know all the results. Do I have to say I was more disappointed with this supplement, at least in the last two years, Freddy seems to have lost his ability. It seems as if the writers are trying to give Freddie a soul and only destroy it instead of re-inventing the story. This was an unnecessary supplement, sorry for Robert England, but that was much less than Freddie Krueger. <br /> <br /> Freddie returned, but he got something we do not know, Daughter. Maggie, did not realize that she was her father, but she soon discovered what his dark secrets were and wanted to help her. She must do her best to resist his powers, but it is difficult with all the good memories of her loving father. Atronic, right? But Freddy does not give up without being manipulated in his ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy Dead: The ultimate nightmare is presented in 3-D, Radical, huh? Note the irony. This is one of the worst results, it is linked to the fifth part of the Nightmare series in the Elm Street series, the second best nightmare in Elm Street to be honest. This was just bad behavior, stupid editing, and above all a bad idea for a story. I did not like this concept, the whole idea has been destroyed about who is really Freddy Krueger, the master of nightmares death, not the father knows better. <br /> <br /> 2/10
