I was watching a lot of animation movies or animations because I have a baby girl who likes watching TV. I started watching this movie to see if I wanted to watch his pet ... no. At first I thought it was a nice film like the Bambi movie, but all the way it seemed like a hint to the beloved was a lesbian. The information said they were making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but it was not. It looks like a movie designed for kids to learn to be gay. He was also very sad, as much as the duck father and all. I do not know, I think if you are gay want it, but I do not think I will see it again with my little one.
