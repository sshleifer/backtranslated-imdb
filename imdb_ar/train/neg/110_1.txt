I have this movie from the library right now and I have not seen it yet. It is very bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn lost her talent completely by then, although she had largely ended up in the film "Robin and Marian". This is the worst thing in this stupid stupid movie. It's really just a matter of interest because it was her last feature film because of Dorothy Stratton's appearance shortly before her murder. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but folly between Gazzara and his companions. Small signs and small arches and gestures to the real spiral comedy, which are the most expensive shades and shadows. <br /> <br /> Who could have believed that some of the suburbs of Manhattan itself, which Hepburn housed in a magical and even mythical way in "Breakfast at Tiffany" twenty years ago? The sound of ancient Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken out loud and clear - you are sure you do not have to wait for credits to discover that something has been incorporated into the picture's music. To know when the songs will explode. <br /> <br /> "Back to Writing" means going back and going back, I think. In this case, the elegant European lady Audrey Hepburn is all that you see for a person who was previously an actress and always a star. I have lost her talent here as a star. If someone continued his talent to grow during this period, like Anne Margaret, he played this role, there would be some life in it, even if we take into account the incredibly bad material and Mongolian attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a wonderful person, of course, bigger than the dream of most movie stars at all, and was once one of the most charming and beautiful actors. After this terrible performance, she continued to produce a terrible TV movie with Robert Wagner entitled "Love Among Thieves." In "They all laughed," it was as though she was still playing a role in her fifties. So many of the worst and less intelligent actresses who have decided to do so, like Lana Turner, have been more effective than Hepburn. Turner took it seriously even when it was bad. Hepburn does not take it seriously at all, and can not be bothered by it; so her hair and her clothes look vulgar. Her last really good job was "Two for the Way" and was probably the best, if not the best, in many ways. <br /> <br /> This girl playing a rural singer is just a disease. John Ritter is terrible, there is nothing I recommend to this film except watch Dorothy Straten, which was really beautiful. Otherwise, the critical phrase used by critic David Thompson "lost his talent" has never been logical. <br /> <br /> Ben Ghazara has not lost all forms of sexual attraction by then, so we have two films with Gasara and Hiborn - who can ask for anything less? Sandra De's latest film was pathetic "lost", two years later, a little budget thing, more. At least Ms. De spoke with her voice; by 1981, the tone of Audrey Hepburn sounded silly. PBS Gardens will continue to work with the world Audrey Hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent as she strolls through English gardens with aristocrats or candles effectively about "What I like most when flowers return to nature!" As in natural daffodils, but in a real fantasy film , Looks silly. <br /> <br /> I think "Tiffany's Breakfast" was such a kind of light poetry with Audrey Hepburn one of the most beautiful women's films in the world - it was certainly one of the most beautiful presence on screen in "My Fair Lady ", where she met Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in" Last Year at Marienbad. "Then this was her last "As always," more than just lady-vulgar things, without lightness and choking. <br /> <br /> I went to her memorial party at the Fifth Church Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that included a choir of boys singing a hymn " Simple gifts. "The only thing not included in the program is the sudden play of Hepburn's singing" Moon River "to escape the fire at" Breakfast in Tiffany's "and this brought a lot of feelings and some real tears into the group. <br /> <br /> A great lady was once a wonderful actress (as in "The Nun's Story") and one of the greatest and most beautiful film stars in many of the 1950s and 1960s movies which became very bad - that's not all that's common. He may be just a great man, in making things like trivial film shows, yet he has the tyranny of the mind in wanting to point out faults mercilessly - which included all her late film works in abundance. Most of the talk revolves around Hepburn's misuse of "my beautiful lady." But the person who should have had the original actress in the film was "Wait until Dark," who starred in Lee Remick on Broadway. She was not celebrated like Hepburn, she was best represented in several ways (Hepburn was not quite able to play anything really dirty), although Hepburn was at least adequate in this part. Then, all of those acting went down.
