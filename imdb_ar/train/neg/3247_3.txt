I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed really promising from the following attractions: Jim Carrey was with Goodlake's powerful idea that certainly worked for me. As a great admirer, I was sure he would have the highest score in his promising hypothesis, and what could be wrong? Yesterday, the big bubble burst, boys and girls, because I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where he was made to hate his life, he is a disgruntled employee and Caravan is not very happy with an ax to grind against God) can be performed, and the second act (called by God on the phone and receives Powers Almighty) - Carrie enjoys with his new "toys" and I'm happy to see them, it's really funny. But the third act is desperate. <br /> <br /> The rot begins to appear after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who comes well enough in this film as part of her drawing machine; even NAME's name is blurred) - she thinks he He would ask "the question," but instead tell her (on the curved knee, though) that he is finally getting a news anchoring job, and is it exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. See, even though she still loves him so much, you see, and the rest of the film is spent hitting us on the head with a pathetic one that goes beyond his weight. I delivered the Clichy resonance after the next, and until the end I was praying, too. . In order to be over. <br /> <br /> I had no objection to inaccuracy in the first two works (Example One - in the second chapter, after gaining his powers, Bruce goes to the room singing "What if God is one of us, just like us "Blah Blah Blah), and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions thrown upon us (for the opening, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce that he can violate anyone's free will but he does so a lot). These choices were forgivable - it's Jim Carrey's comedy, directed by Tom Shadyak - it's still the day. <br /> <br /> Or rather it was supposed to be a comedy. When a screenwriter loses that (in the terrible act 3) and tries to convert actions into a kind of gag, then what we get instead is hell on earth. Bruce realizes his selfish ways wrong, and he realizes that Grace is his saving - I must say - a blessing, and that his priorities in life have been badly misunderstood. All this could have been moved in a much less harsh way. The film did not have to enter the dump truck to make these points. Unfortunately, it is clear that the writers and Shadyak had no idea how to solve the story in any smart and intelligent way, so they took the hopeful path of hope in the hope that we would not notice it. So they dealt with some outside players unexpectedly in the end, hoping to reduce this bad taste. That did not work for me.
