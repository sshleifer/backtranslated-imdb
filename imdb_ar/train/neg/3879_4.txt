Iron is an astronaut who makes the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course it's a horror film that turns ugly and returns to Earth as the only survivor. Suffers from a state of strangeness that makes him slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, kills what appears to be the only hospital nurse and flees to the neighboring town to chase more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the assumption, the effects of the monsters and the dose are very good indeed, but the space scenes are glued together outside NASA footage, and the hospital looks as curious as the repository. A very weak script, a little character development, and generally acting badly, prevents that person from rising above anything other than a modest flick with the novelty of having a live candle as a killer, and has more or less only the enormous effects that hold your attention. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, exclusive to the most brutal monster movie lovers.
