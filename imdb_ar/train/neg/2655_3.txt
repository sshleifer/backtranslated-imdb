** 1/2 For this farce Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton, enough of your own Annie Hall philosophy and hats. <br /> <br /> This kitten dies Keaton's daughter Sarah in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, which was not accessible by phone at first, because she was in a bag with her boyfriend and had pulled out of the phone plug, grieves in a new way for those affected. <br /> <br /> Back to the summer place where all Sara's friends stay. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to reveal things that would have been best not disclosed. Sarah seems sweet and slept with her girlfriend and the man who finally married the latter. In addition, she had an abortion thanks to this man. We are all in this sinful journey. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find elusive memoirs kept by Sarah. She also hopes that her boyfriend, Adam, a playwright, will not integrate this into another play. <br /> <br /> When notes are found, they are written in Japanese. Sarah got a PhD in this language. This is not great news for my mother when an excerpt from the diary is translated by a Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything seems to have been well linked in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time my mother and Sara talk, they talk about Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, during this extraordinary period of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Allen Allen in his domestic film, where he tried to successfully simulate Ingmar Bergman. Mrs. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind can mourn this way? <br /> <br /> It is best to summarize this film moderately.
