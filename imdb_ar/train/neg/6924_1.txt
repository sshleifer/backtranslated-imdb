If this movie is worse, it was directed by Uwe Boll. This illogical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been some time since I saw this heap, but I remember that I wanted to inflict serious bodily harm on all concerned. How can anyone give this movie more than one star amazes me for the generosity of all who watched this trip. I give it one star because there is no lower rating. All copies of this film should be copied from the salt-cultivated land and placed as a burial site for the largest toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept under ultra-high protection and only shown to filmmakers as an example of how not to do so.
