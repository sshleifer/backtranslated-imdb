Weak performance of Sinatra, Martin and Haier. Supporting characters are significantly backward. An annoying conversation with no real conspiracy. The finish leaves you flatter over pancake, with more loose ends than can be linked in four strings (ie, even if you care about these wooden figures). McLean is the only true origin. This pre-final sequence where the Chicago hood looks for Sinatra's personality is laughable. The music in this sequence is also bad. In the final scene, when Martin removed his hat from the woman he called "pig," he almost took me out and found a stone to throw through the television screen.
