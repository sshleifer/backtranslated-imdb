There was something I really liked about the short films of this woman - the elusive theme - especially in Living With Happiness. This film has some nice beginnings - an unusual location and a strange cinematic treatment, but it fails to succeed with the highly-coded induction dialogue, unfinished presentations and very TV coverage. <br /> <br /> It's a very charming TV again for regular cinema. The ideas are so simple that they feel like they've become like a TV ad. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I really like to see this director making full-length animated drawings and trying to work with a product that does not ask for much boredom and clarity.
