Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about thirteen seconds of etchings and what does Gene Barry do in all this film? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This film has no sense at all. The writer / inefficient director (the same dude) has killed everyone's talents through his terrible work uh ... I got a DVD for a single shark so I can not complain! It's strange! This makes you feel alienated and not in a good way. This was in the seventies and it seems that the director was on a bad tart trip and everyone wanted to test what they looked like inside his head. It is a somewhat controversial concept, but controversial, like a scratched record. It is characterized by "Manson family on acid". <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything they did from this film? Maybe they did it again? However, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life you will never return to. Yes, this is terrible!
