Alex de Linz replaces McCulay Kolkin as the central character in the third film in the Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies get a chip-guided computer chip and smuggle it through an airport in a remote-controlled toy car. Because of the confusion in the luggage, Mrs. Hess (Marianne Silides) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor Alex (Linz), before the spies emerge. The spies rent a house to rob each house in the neighborhood until the vehicle is located. In the house alone with chickenpox, Alex calls 911 each time he discovers an ongoing robbery, but spies always get away from the police while Alex is accused of making joke calls. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, unaware that he has rigged the devices to blow his entire house intelligently. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but maybe it was not possible to make it. You can not replace McCauley Kolkin or Joe Bisky or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I do not like when characters change in a series of movies, the show is at your own risk.
