I rated this movie as wonderful (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be great. "Guaranteed abuse ... everyone!" A trailer said. Well, I got angry because this film really sucked him. It is hardly a comedy, as I laughed for two seconds during the entire film. And what is all gays in this film? I'm not gay and I have no problem with those who are, but what is the point of adding many gay scenes in a comedy called movie, when these scenes are not funny at all? I think the director gay man in denial, or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice to you is: If you want to lose good money, hire a good comedy that I've already seen a million times, you'll be better off watching Mother Of All Lousy Comedy. It's really a total crap.
