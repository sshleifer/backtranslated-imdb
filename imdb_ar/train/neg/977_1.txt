"Playground fever" is not a bad film; it's a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Is it possible to seduce American audiences and critics and subject them to feces so much that Hollywood is hiding so much that they will be praised in heaven even in a modest film that barely laughs? That's the only reason I think of why this horrible romantic comedy (I use the term loosely because there's nothing funny in this movie) gets good ratings. <br /> <br /> I sat in this film surprised this script for Lowell and I thought Ganz and Babalu Mandel for a moment that their line was funny. <br /> <br /> The great Nick Hornby usually translates the film well. He adapted Fever Pitch for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was directed to a film in 2000, authors D.V. Devincentes, Steve Pink, John Kozak and Scott Rosenberg did not make mistakes because they kept the essence of Hornby's intelligence and humor. They produced one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> So why does the American version of "Fever Pitch" stumble painfully? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny and unexpected and gave us two characters we could love, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Janez and Mandel stirred up everything funny in Hornby's work. When the story was Americanized, they cut it off and removed everything that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replaced it with traditional masterpieces. <br /> <br /> They have turned a funny story into a contemporary romantic comedy, never deviating once from the miserable formula. Lindsay (Drew Barrymore) has three friends, each with a distinct function. Weight gain, the second cynical and ambitious, the third romantic. Do you want to guess the number of male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon)? <br /> <br /> What made a "high fun" such a pleasure was not just a man and a well-prominent woman, but also co-supporting personalities. In "Fever Pitch," the six friends support or do not say anything particularly funny. They are not very important, so they are not ornate. The only reason for their presence in the film is that the formula requires it. The poor Iye Skye concludes Lindsay's role as a thankless actor. The beautiful Sky must have wished Lloyd Doppler to break it and take it away. Come to think of it, I have made Cusack Ben excellent. Of course, Cusack is so clever that it does not connect itself with such a completely boring scenario. <br /> <br /> There is no single moment in this film that seems authentic or unenforceable. Each predictable plot cycle, each lame telegraph joke. Ganz and Mandel work for laughter. The first 45 minutes are too slow, wondering if these classes realized they were writing a comedy. You can select a plot turns in this movie from your watch. It seems as if Janz and Mandel put it in the form of some of the writing teachers on the screen glued to the wall. When they reached a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "Well, the teacher says that should happen now." The masculine! <br /> <br /> Bobby and Peter Varelli do not help the film. They have no idea how to present their story and personalities (they deliver V.O's not to the protagonist, but to someone else sitting behind Ben in the Fenway Park). Thanks to some of the most shameful writings, we have to see Barrymore and Fallon stumbling over their initial, unfamiliar meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore does his best and most wonderful. It's so good at Goldie Hoon at its peak. But even its attractiveness can not save this horrific film. Trying hard to win some energy and humor from this story. About 30 minutes after the film, Lindsay Ben told, "You're funny." The only explanation for their statement is that it was in the script. Ben will not say anything funny even remotely. Fallon is neither clever nor funny; when he makes comedy, he is overly exaggerating. <br /> <br /> Fallon was not good at "Saturday Night Live". Probably the least funny person in this show. Remember to draw lame about the DJ radio who did all the sounds? The only reason "weekend update" has been successful from time to time is that the Fallon group, Tina Fei, knows something or two about comedy. <br /> <br /> The actors who think they are funny and act in this way rarely, if it happens, are really funny. This is true of Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely makes a chuckle. His clumsy and uncertain story on the small screen did not work; it was bad on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this picture also requires some exciting moments. If you think the movie comedy was bad, wait until you get a lot of dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular - the first in the park, the second in front of Ben school - painful to watch. The viewer requires a cleverly intelligent actor, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make it work. A set of emotions does not even run a string from A to B. <br /> Ben does not have a character or depth. Often, it just happens to be a raft. And not loved in it. The mind boggles what Lindsay might find attractive. Compare Fallon's performance with the British version of Firth, and you will understand how wrongly Falon Ben was flat, very funny and how wrong he was in this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" makes one yearn for the stunning depth and comedy differences of Ashton Kutcher! <br /> <br /> Just as High Fidelity did, the American "Fever Pitch" worked brilliantly. It took a better book and a good director, and certainly a stronger, more entertaining and intelligent man. Do yourself a great interest: avoid this rotten movie. Rent a 1997 British version and read the Hornby book, instead.
