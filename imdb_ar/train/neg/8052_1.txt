I sat through this turkey because I had not seen it before and because the hypothesis seemed to have potential. It was mildly amused until the cyclone sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to pull the windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are fully upright and no paper moves! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the bright sunlight is visible as it lights up the heads of the trees. At that point, whatever credibility filmmakers developed was faster than the heavily translated rain of their film. Too bad all hurricanes are not like this one, it certainly will help our homeowners insurance rates here in Sunshine.
