I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of film junk and it took at least two pages to know that someone else did not think that horrible montage was not the height of humor in the 1970s or anywhere else! If this is not the least funny collection of drawing * comedy * I've seen it will do so come. Half of the theater performances have already been completed (and infinitely better) through works such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I had to say that a beautiful piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film does not come close to summarizing The 75-minute waste of this waste is lost. Sex comedy? Only in the world where semen really means. Funny humor? Only in a world where feces is actually feces. Precursors jokes? Only if we mean that this is proof of how not to do comedy. Boobs and bums and a strange beaver. Nice ... if you are a boy who is engaged in at least one free hand and you do not discover the existence of Playboy. Give her a break because she was in her early 70s? Not possible. There was an initial comedy that dates back at least ten years. The only way I can even forgive her this film is to be at gunpoint. Retro? barely. There may be skits about clowns who cleverly mischievate children in some circles (and it may be funny in fact), but it seems very sad. What made me last for 75 minutes? Just a belief that they may have saved a really funny comic play of the end. I was given the film 1 because there was not any less degree ... I can only recommend it to insomnia or coma patients ... or maybe people with a lower jaw problem ... their minds will eventually open up to disbelief.
