I do not think I ever felt this before a film. After my love Guy Ritchie in two previous films (I do not count Soipt Ao - he was blind pussy), I was looking forward to seeing this. <br /> <br /> The ratings were bad, and then again, I do not trust the press anyway. The most worrying thing was the fact that the Internet buzz was that it was a bit stingy, so it was with some of the concerns that I handed over after Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not even try my experience to explain this film, mainly because I had no idea what was going on, and at one point I was honestly standing near the stand and asked me if I had just not got it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Richie seems to have fallen into the trap of his wife by taking himself too seriously. It seems that he was not good enough for him to make films with good schemes, laughs, quick dialogue and good personalities. It looks like he had a checklist of movies he wanted to rip, here are some of the movies I've noticed: The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were in fact very good and they really were the amazing story and editing / direction that allowed the film to be down. <br /> <br /> So, a big big thumbs down.
