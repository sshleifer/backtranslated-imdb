It is a fool to indulge in such great actors in a weak and boring film. In addition to all the unanswered questions published in other comments, what is the difficulty in capturing thieves? You only have to eliminate the bank staff and find out who was in the bank - from all angles of the camera shots - before the thieves enter and you have those remaining thieves among the hostages. Where is the thrill that everyone talks about? It was quite clear the moment when the hostages were asked to turn into this uniform so that they would all come out of the front door ... they saw him several times. At least, Mr. Spike Lee had experimented with some good musical scores and artistic shooting. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
