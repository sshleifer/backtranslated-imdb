Really scary movie. I did not know at first that this was a Kiwi effort - but I soon began to realize that all the characters were speaking in kiwi dialects disguised with difficulty under the American counterfeit. Why do you need to adjust n America anyway? - It could be set in NZ and then the actors can use their normal voices. Surely someone on the production team can hear the terrible attempts to speak in American dialects? Bad movie bad. I'm surprised it lasted for a long time - how did you make it out of the box? It looked like a very bad attempt at the game of Segal / Willis-type flick. If there is any money from TAXPAYER in this piece of garbage, I will drive a revolution to return all the money to the treasury. I still stagger (get it? Punk, reeling!) In the absolute garbage that I just saw. Why did you keep watching? Well, I'm a film fanatic and cant help, myself!
