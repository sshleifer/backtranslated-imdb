I've seen every episode of this spin. I thought the first season was a good effort, taking into account the expectations of such success, Gray's Anatomy. So continued watching. I am afraid that the second season lacks magic and chemistry, and more importantly is the drama of his predecessor Gray's Anatomy. Relationships seem fabricated and representation is not so. Writing lacks the intelligence and comedy hints that were seen in the General Assembly. There is evidence that the equation but do not feel that the formula is volatile, unfortunately PP is not. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in the General Assembly. I fear that the life of Kate Walsh in Los Angeles is not interesting.
