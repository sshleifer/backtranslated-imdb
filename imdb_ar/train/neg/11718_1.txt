It's unbelievable !! .. Yes, someone before me wrote that it was a waste of time to sit and watch this movie .. It! Do not do it! I am completely artificial! I liked Wesley Snipes and I found it funny that he played the meaning of his name in the film. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (at home only of course) but now (after that) I'm very disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! A bad actor playing! Bad photographer! Bad scenario! .. think one good: that wonderful girl! Must be a dwarf for sure! Eeeeh !! Â· 10 minimum lines? I do not want to waste your time anymore reading my opinion! I hope to be clear and less stable, because English is not the mother way to talk. So you have a good time, and watched good movies, as I also try .. Peace!
