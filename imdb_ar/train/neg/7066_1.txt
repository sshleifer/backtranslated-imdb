When I go into this, I was expecting anything really good, but after the damage done to me, I'm happy to think about this strait. It's hard to think about what film makers (HA!) Have been doing well. Stories, I use the world loose, incoherent and meaningless at all. There are only stupid things that happen randomly. Representation, if representation can be called a terrible thing I saw the mixture acting in the game ads! I know they are bin nightmares for low budget budgets, but still so as if they had tried. After I thought so, I feel very sleepy and still have it, I will go to lie down. <br /> <br /> Warning: Do not try to drive, walk, read or do anything after watching coolers.
