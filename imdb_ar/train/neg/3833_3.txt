This film is a farce, not fit to keep the original original company. The plot is an absolute mess, and the film is too long. Each time they struggle, they inject desperately with a passionate reminder of the first film. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the top 10 British films ever, this movie is very bad.
