There are three types of bad films - cheap, boring, and tasteless. The only really bad films are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> Boring movies are fair, boring, and if you do not leave fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Tasteless films are protected by them; but the fact remains that they help to practice masturbation for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only cheap bad films are really funny, because filmmakers want to make their films desperately, they've gone beyond their capabilities and available resources. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is just a dull, natural and tasteless. Fortunately, their fate and lack of money and skills replace them by making them look cheap as well. This movie is hilarious and may be the last really bad film it ever makes. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time in one of the demobilized, God forgive me; I was laughing hard I was giving up my seat, as well as with the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> Derrick and her husband, the promoter, are clearly a partial reflection of the film. Unfortunately, Derek clearly lacks any resources to pull it off; so the "sarcastic" element is based on the impression of some schoolgirls The impression of a young man like me of Gurshin's frank impression of the mystery in Batman as he tries to pretend to be Robin - he does not fly over our heads, and has no idea where any human head might be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some serious moments assumed in this film - the action film is supposed to be, remember - to be amazing cheese, and one wonders if someone's milk is flowing in the eye. <br /> <br /> As for the evil Miel Derek to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine a photo show less nudity exciting, she is very curious looking with these broad shoulders, imagine what anyone saw it. <br /> <br /> As with the plot - as it is - well, it is not; Derrick is chasing Africa, and God alone knows why. Her father, Harris, pretends to work in some obscure puppet shows, and of course there is a large piece of Tarzan who seems to have wondered about the ad without knowing that the subject has changed - perhaps because he has not seen a scenario - apparently no one else has. <br /> <br /> Camera action is unimportant, and unmatched editing - if not in the direction of the trio with the chimpanzees - the film will be unlikely - <br /> <br /> As it is, it is a real scream.
