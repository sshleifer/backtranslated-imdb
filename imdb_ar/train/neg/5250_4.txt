I adore the book written by Robin Klein completely, so I was very excited when I heard that a film based on the book was in the making. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the film when I saw it because it did not understand what I liked in the book - Erika was very ridiculous and ironic about the way you look at the world. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film, I have realized that things have gotten worse is the same as I imagined in the book. So, just went for a ride. Not all that was bad, I think. Miss Belmont was quite different from what I imagined! I did not think they would be the one to smoke and drink - Jean Kitson, who plays, hilarious! <br /> <br /> By itself, I thought that the film and its actors / actresses did a good job, but unfortunately, I'm a book lover (one of my favorite books at all) I could not help but be disappointed = P
