If this can be classified at 0, it will be. From the terrible woodwork to the slow pace, the exploitation angle of the boyish and the bipolar chant that was added just for the sad viewers, this is a disaster for a film. <br /> <br /> Predictable, starting from the beginning, is quite sure what will happen to all characters and how the plot will begin. From the dull and extraordinary start to the pathetic and depressing endings, each presence is lost in this film, and every tiny scrap of talent dug into this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with lots of the same babyish tickle, watch one of Elsa's movies. At least they are not aware of what they are trying to do. How a very bad thing has been rated above 5 is a miracle how people who do not have taste or distinctive standards can sometimes meet for dubious purposes. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it does not make any sense to the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime in which such an abhorrently cruel and incompetent piece has been conceived and given the necessary resources to exist, and even the most tragic tragedy that is still being defended by some deceptively misleading viewers. <br /> <br /> Even the delightful character of Elvira and the ways of joking can alleviate this terrible horror picture of the film. Avoid at all costs.
