This excuse to get rid of trash for TV is the most inspiring piece of trash ever made in Australian television. His colleagues at home are boring, disinterested and unwise and chosen on the grounds that you are likely to try to kill them if you have to live with them. As far as I am concerned, the older brother is the deterioration of Western society, showing us as a society on a steep slope to become a dead brain genius. What happened to television that did not target the lowest common denominator of society as a public? This can not be classified as Entertainment. I think it's true that Channel 10 can remove your spirit. That happened with Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedy, and after moving to Channel 10, he was not too scared. With the exception of the Simpson family, which was very smartly manufactured.
