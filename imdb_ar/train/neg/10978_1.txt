Usually, when a movie receives one vote, it is because someone simply hates it, gets annoyed, does not have a lower rating, and therefore decides to withdraw it as much as possible rather than just giving it a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. Do not do something right and do not have the opportunity because it is not trying to do anything. There are filaments of a bad D & D novel type of plot that do not stick together and total lack of any kind of acting all the time. It is clear that no one involved in this project has made any serious effort, because even the hard work of the very talented people will be more. Really terrible film.
