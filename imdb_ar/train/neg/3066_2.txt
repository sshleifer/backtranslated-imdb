This is a terrible new film for a marginal but lovable film from the early 1970s. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute 'packed' movie in two hours or whatever run-time. A cheesy story, which by the way, is completely different from the original. The main government involvement was elusive. There is no flow from one scene to another. Originally, you can go for a beer or hit the bathroom and still continue. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours to change the oil pan on the car. It takes several times longer than that in real life. Men car notes these things. Also, the heel must be shot foolishly or a lie invented to get rid of the 1968 charger and abuse the Challenger 1970 model. The fact that they are not painfully "car people" will not grieve their death. <br /> <br /> Representatives lacked any feelings, everything was cut and dried. One step above monotonous. barmitzvah more exciting and lively. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not least, Radio DJ stated that Challenger hit bulldozers in 180 or 185 (??). This is the total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics, or not? Hahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this one.
