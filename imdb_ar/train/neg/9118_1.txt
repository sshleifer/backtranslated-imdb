It's literally the worst movie I have ever seen. The worst movie may be possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; this film is so bad that it has gone through an enjoyable camp and has simply become so bad. This is anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of checking, and gathered all my family members into an enjoyable evening of smart notes; instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying the poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the consequences of Matrix. It's worse than Krol. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Do not let this movie, under any circumstances, come within 10 meters of the TV.
