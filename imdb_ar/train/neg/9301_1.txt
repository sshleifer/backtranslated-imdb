Spoilers forward if you want to call them ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie almost so people can really see 1/10. From where we start, we'll start from the top ... <br /> <br /> Story: Do not believe the premise - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people completely understand what is happening in the mysterious events of. It's a basic film, go to the movie cabin without any intensity or "effort." <br /> <br /> Screen: I usually give credits to freelance script writers, it's hard work when you start ... but that's crap. The story is flat - leaving you without emotion in the entire film. The dialogue is very weak and predictable with lines "Woah, you scared me completely" and "I was wondering if you wanted uh ... if you want it ... will you come to the cabin with me?". Makes me want to rip all my hair, once every time and feed it to myself. <br /> <br /> Characters: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as flat, and I want to take them one step further and say they already have the opposite characters .. They actually start working on being parallel and start working almost ... <br /> <br /> Cast: The worst of characters They are the actors. They are already taking poor written characters and they are adding a dramatic drama to a terrible high school. It was said that "Woah you freaked you out out" was uninteresting and slow - as if absent. I can only complain to the representatives for hours. <br /> <br /> Technician: Lighting: An eight-year-old boy will be disappointed by the lighting in this film. Very ambiguous in areas, too bleak in other areas. The output should not use light as a passion until it learns how to properly illuminate the primary scene. Baby steps! Sound: How many audio players need to produce a very powerful movie? 9. With that many sound players this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has happened. There is one scene in particular explodes really, these guys driving the car and changing the sound of the car with every corner camera .... WEAK! Camera: Learn how to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm out of the area of ​​complaint ..... I hired it - I dare you ... Hire it and learn from it ... Give it one assessment .. worth it. <br /> <br /> Sign out ... Amanda Christmas
