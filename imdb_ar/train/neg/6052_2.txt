Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," John Carpenter's Season One in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed to be a cheap intersection between "the mouth of insanity" and "8 mm", but it was still good for budget constraints and time allotted. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints certainly appear more than anything else. There is a strong steering as always from Carpenter, but there is quality in the writing and full production itself gives the feeling that it was made in full and complete thrust. The text is not always clear, the message is vague, and the story is filled with certain holes as soon as it is referenced. Perhaps Carpenter rewrote the script, it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest fun in. Certainly the worst of what Carpenter did. 10/02
