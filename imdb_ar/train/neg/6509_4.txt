Shawn-Penn is gorgeous as well as photography and fashion websites. However, the piece of land is rather confused, and the conclusion is flat. The plot has been dramatically changed from Cornwell's novel, not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than seen. Sharp was drawn here very narrowly, unlike his literary ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension of his new role as a promoted officer of rank. I really enjoyed the short scene in which Sharpe was stumbled by a "real" officer, and after a quick pause and a piercing piercing, the officer suddenly pushed back. It defines the tone of subsequent trials as a commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" from "10."
