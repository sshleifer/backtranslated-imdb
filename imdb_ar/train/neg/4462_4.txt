A "real" story of three girls going to the wilderness of Connecticut and ending up crazy. This is the kind of film that could have played its part in North America thirty years ago to receive mixed praise. Especially in anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is viewable but not scary at all (some of the scenes of the attack are blamed). It's the kind of movie you might forget when you're done. The odds are that you will never think of seeing this unless someone is handed over to you and tells them, "Watch here here," and that's what happened to me. If you hand out a copy to return, the movie is not worth the effort to see it even if it's viewable.
