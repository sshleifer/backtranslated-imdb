Okay. So it's a low-budget "movie" (I used quotes because it was filmed in a Hi-8 video). The representation is horrifyingly universal, the makeup is laughable (the blood seems to come from Sherron Williams and I see more convincing bruises made from the ghouls in Halloween), and the lighting generally looks like they used a Toyota Pickup pickup for someone to shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I may be able to forgive these low-budget features if there is some actual content if a film tries to tell a story. But this collection of videos can boast of no plot, real characters or momentum. It is an overwhelming mess. <br /> <br /> Do not worry - there are no spoilers here, because nothing is ever spoiled.
