I hate throwing lines like this, but in this case I feel compelled to do so: The new version of The Grudge is the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last five years. I said there. Now that I have gone out of my system, please let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When a person dies in the grip of strong anger, a curse is born, the curse in this place gathers death, those who face them will be consumed by their anger." This is the premise of the grudge, I will admit it seems intriguing. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not take it. Those who face "damn" are already consuming their anger and that is all you get. you want more? Well too bad. Some critics and admirers point out that the only purpose of THE GRUDGE is to intimidate you. The problem is that when there is no plot to talk, the scary images and sounds can go away. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulls out George Sluizer and re-produces his original film (his films), trying valiantly to build the atmosphere in the first hour? Repeating the same scene over and over again. This unfolds dramatically: <br /> <br /> - Someone enters the house <br /> <br /> - Something flickers next to the camera and / or hears a strange voice <br /> <br /> - Someone goes to investigate <br /> <br /> - The sound starts to get loud - <br /> <br /> - A person who sees a ghost <br /> <br /> - High screaming and / or cat screaming <br /> <br /> /> - select black <br /> <br /> Even before giving the audience a hint of planning, this same scenario unfolds exactly 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually rather creepy. All subsequent use became funny as the film continued. As the end of the film unfolds, my friend and I wonder whether this scene will end "loud and cut to black." We were never wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no film in the film, but it unfolds in a series of short articles that left the audience mixed. I have no problem with nonlinear storytelling when it is done correctly. The film jumps from time to time without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a film in such a situation since the opening of the high-drama version of HIGHLANDER 2. This storytelling technique tells what kind of ambiguity this film can have. If you already know that ghosts dimmed two characters to death, how come it is shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? Why should we care when a detective tries to investigate mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> The second version of the US version of THE RING is clearly $ 15 million on the first weekend, thanks to green. It is only the calculated calculated imitation as the actual film. The most terrifying thing about The Grudge is that it earned $ 40 million on the first weekend, while some consider it "the most terrifying film ever". I wonder what happens to those who consume the wrath of paying to see the grudge?
