1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can not believe you wasted only two hours of your life seeing the role of credits. I honestly think I can get the best vampire film .... and I do not know anything. The only thing that is not just absorbed (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... his character is at least fascinating, and has some mystery, and kicked a bit.
