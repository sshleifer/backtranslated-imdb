This film was a great promise. I was very excited about this film. In the end, it was funny at best, and painful at worst. The representation patterns of a series of really, really, flat (angels, wife and daughter) turned to animation (the character of Casper). I felt that dialogue was just an attempt to convey information to the public rather than real people trying to talk to each other. Pay particular attention to the scene on the "bug". It is an insult to the public's ability to discover things. In defense of this scene, he got the biggest laugh of the entire film. I have read that they have spent a lot of money to travel to different locations abroad. Very bad did not benefit from it. I did not feel like I was moved to strange places. Anyone can insert footage from the runway in Rome. However, to put a positive end, I thought the groups were good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on PC decoders. In my opinion (that's all there is to it) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would be much lower and the ACTION factor would increase significantly, this movie would be good.
