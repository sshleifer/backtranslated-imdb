If I had not read his name on the cover of a DVD, I would never have thought that this rich old musician was presented by a man very close to the new French wave. In fact, the film is so far away that I wonder if the authors of the new wave in the 1950s and 1960s will hate this kind of film altogether - it's ... unrealistic. He seems to have nothing to do with many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just something surprising. <br /> <br /> What I found also somewhat surprising is the amount of praise some reviewers gave to this movie - especially when there are many better French musicals there. The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting, and all the characters seemed very nice and stereotyped. If I had to see another rich person worried about how hard it was to be rich or get a good sale price in one of the designers' clothes, I would. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that like American musicals, not all French music is gone. This film is not "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (Eight WOMEN) and although there is Audrey Tautou, I do not see much reason to recommend it as anything strange.
