What Hopkins succeeds in this effort as a writer and director gives us a feeling that no one knows at all in the film. However, the problem may lie. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were clearly complex and derived from his depths, but very impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who is one, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It may be a filmwriter interfering with his characters. Really? Can. I do not mean that Slipstream is fuzzy. I mean there is no saying. Hopkins movie is an experience. On the face of it, one can make the case revolve around the existence of a potential screenwriter, who realizes at the moment his destiny meets that life is beaten and lost, and / or success is a blind chance, because a "collision" is thrown between the collisions between points in time, dreams , Ideas, and reality. However, it is so continuous that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even to the very primitive extent that allows us to communicate with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the nipple and a thriving school of camera-making and gun-shaking editing had spared me, but thinking about the film, I began to realize it was about him. There are many films over the last decade where the segments or motion camera have sound effects in addition to other artistic dads that deteriorate the atmosphere. I suppose in this case that this is justified because it is intended to form an impressionistic response to dreams. However, I hardly knew anything about Slipstream when watching it and went out the same way. I do not care, because Hopkins did not make any effort to make us care. There are interactive films, there are movies sitting on a rocking chair and lovers, not knowing your existence. Sleepstream is the last.
