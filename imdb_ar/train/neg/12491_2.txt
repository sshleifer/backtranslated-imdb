His Majesty the King. While an interesting film evokes intriguing plots, references to terrible influences, special (at best) primitive effects (all of which have made me watch this film three times over the last six years), Severed has ranked among the worst ever seen. I'm not sure who the heroes are. All I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as shown in the scene of the murder in the ballroom. All in all, I do not really like the film, because the first 30 minutes are just fun, and the rest is a mix of dialogue and confusing images that fails to make the story a logical one (I can not remember anyway).
