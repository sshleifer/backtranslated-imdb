After watching this movie on DVD, you watched the trailer. Describes the film as a surreal film. Well, there is surrealism, and there is surrealism. <br /> <br /> There was only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more disconcerting than Surrealism. The other unusual pictures, especially the lunch room scene where everyone was on the ground, were so illogical that it made no sense. I do not mind images that mean nothing, but these scenes seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director was trying to transfer Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what to explain. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any idea what Logan was thinking, what his point of view was, or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he was more crushed than an old boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the end would indicate what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much happened. Intentional deliberate scenes with those that were more obvious were more like a police conference than a technical one. <br /> <br /> However, because the film was exhausting and free of content, it was a clear change in speed. I loved Madagascar strongly and I felt that this film looked forward to this kind of narrative and perhaps even style. Not even close. For me, no doubt about it: this film deserves A for effort, but D for execution.
