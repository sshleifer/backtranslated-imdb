This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy comedy about two Hollywood investigators, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are investigating a shootout at the hip-hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is fabricated and there are a lot of persistent side problems. Ford is marketing the real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients). Hartnett runs a yoga school where he collects the chicks in his free time. They are under investigation by internal affairs. Ford spoils former friend Lena Olin of the IA investigator, a psychologist with a radio program, The man who was killed in the club is a dirty former cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Toss in the compulsive car chases and some lame attempts at humor, this is about the essence of this Turkey.
