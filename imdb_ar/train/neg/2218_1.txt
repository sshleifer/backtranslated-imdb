I admit that my review is from the perspective of 2006, almost 30 years after the production of this film, and at the time it appeared, it was perhaps a wonderful film of horror / excitement. <br /> <br /> From Halloween night in 1968, Michael, aged 6, committed the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution, and after 15 years he runs away and returns to his hometown to be killed again. <br /> <br /> From this point, it is clear that the film will follow a basic and primitive route that is highly predictable. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it ends up while the music for each scene containing Michael (the killer) is exactly the same during the film, thus alerting the viewer to potential events that must be followed. <br /> <br /> For fans of horror / excitement, there is a severe shortage of blood / unfairness compared to modern-day movies although I am not as much of the quantity offered in this day and age. A happier middle can be found. <br /> <br /> From half an hour to the movie, there is no one unexpected scene. Representation for the horror / thriller is fairly typical of the age, and therefore lacks any weight for modern-day lovers. <br /> <br /> Among the positive things in the film are long camera shots and dark lighting that create a frightening atmosphere. The second positive aspect would be the personality of Michael's physician who offers evidence of the potential lead story. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie Lee Curtis, in her childhood stages of career representation, thus failed to deliver a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It is hard to evaluate this film as it was in its day, but from other horror films / suspense really in the 80s and to a lesser extent, in the eighties, the film was away from the horror film / excitement really wonderful. <br /> <br /> I suggest moving and finding a classic story from the 1980s. Cheers!
