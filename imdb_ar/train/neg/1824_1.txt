I do not envy Barry Levinson or Rachel Weiss or Ben Stiller or Jack Black to do this movie. It's one boring word. Perhaps the fact that the role of Ben Stiller the loser or the funny scenes that can be predicted more than just exploitation, makes it possible to forget this film. Even the appearance of Christopher and Kane ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved him in most of his films, the last film I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not so bad. About Black Jack ... Well, apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do anything good. What about Rock School? Sorry, scary.
