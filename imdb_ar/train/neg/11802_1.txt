Drake the Absolute. I got 16 minutes / 27 second points and surrendered. I've given him a negative number review if possible (although "pissible" is a more relevant word ...). Unlike the sizzling that you can see and feel practically between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dumb 'ol' Dicky Crenna and what exists here is absent. An anklet becomes a chunky bracelet unattractive? Is there no ciggy lighting by finger? I thought I would be sick when they had a shaky (and believe me) look to me as Jay Kopp as Keyes, swallowing / practically bouncing his way through Mr. Garlubis's "Little Man" explanation. Not an insults to the unseen, but it seems as if a group of blind men have adhered to the specific design of each of the Detercion odd houses. The same goes for those loose-cut pants worn by Phyllis. And the crikey, how much is $ $ that makes it Neff, a living overlooking a huge marina? This, people, again, all happens in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get more, you have a stronger constitution than me, or you're a masochist. But please take some of the Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop your own "little man" that may never disappear. Go ahead with caution, obviously.
