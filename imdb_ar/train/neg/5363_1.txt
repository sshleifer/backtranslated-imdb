I did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except Janine Turner, no imagination, stupid plot, stupid husband ass and unfairly seizure. If you have not seen this movie before so do not bother, it is not worth it at all. The only thing that was good was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a defense lawyer for stuck intelligence, won many cases and even got murderers guilty. He thinks he is very intelligent but he is really just a frost. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and fears her. Pretty girl huh. Yes it's real peach, no. It's not a day on the beach either.
