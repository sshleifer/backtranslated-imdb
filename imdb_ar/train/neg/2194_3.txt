The premise is neat. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that speeding out of control insanely on the weekend might not be the best idea at all. I loved how Bill spins comfortably out of the car and down the hill without any injuries at all! Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said for him Gal. Oh, and the police never found the vehicle or tracked down the wreck owner. <br /> <br /> Lots of scenes have been pulled out including a plain stripper (she still has nightmares from this scene). Poor poor man and his hands useless useless. I admit I was fascinated to see what was the mysterious "thing" behind the door, but when he appeared, I just laughed. Ha ha ha !! The girl really sounded angry sadite from the revival. Personally I really want a new body after an exciting experience like this!
