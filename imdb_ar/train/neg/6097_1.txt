In 1985, this thing (I can not even name it a film) caught on the cable. I was in college and I was with a friend in high school whose hormones were out of control. I discovered early that this was hopeless. A stupid scenario (a bunch of older people employ some young people to show them how to score results with women), bad behavior (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. Naked female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even bored after 30 minutes. This was once again before nudity was so easy to get through the internet as well. We kept watching hope in something interesting or funny but that never happened. The crux of the matter is the original advertising campaign in which the studio admitted that this movie was nonsense! (One of the posters made a fictional review saying, "This is the best film I've seen this afternoon!"). Grant Kramer only showed up at the forefront of any talent and already went to a career in business. No budget and boring R & A. skip it.
