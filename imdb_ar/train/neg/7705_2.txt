(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I figured I should count. The DVD did not display the time or time it took. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime film I've ever seen. This one is much worse. Does not make sense. The plot was thrown together. All that so we can see large breasts on a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It was a student film. This horse got a grade C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out it will not end.) Finish making any meaning darn <br> /> <br /> Replayable: 0/10
