This was a new all-time low among Westerners. The writing is very bad, the characters are impossible to emphasize and are either disgusting or bad, violence is appalling and not technically enforced. Toby Maguire shows us the other side of his talent, walking on his part through those eyes that do not express the expression and arrogant voice that betrays here only behavioral. "Ride With the Devil" is one of my worst five films ever, as the West is never overlooked in negative respect.
