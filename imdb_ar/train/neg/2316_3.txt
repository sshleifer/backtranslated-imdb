After reading over many years about the magnificence of this film, and how Ruiz founded French critics (especially the crowd of cynical caves), when I finally saw him a year ago, I found it very frustrating (but then, I think the expectations were sky high). This intentional black-and-white film (fortunately made for only one hour) was filmed in the form of a conversation between an expert and a novelist outside the screen as they studied a series of paintings (shown in tableaux) and tried to find what If they have some clues about a hidden political crime. (The terrifying "Kate Beckinsell" has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this film, but I say that the story of Borges is almost more interesting than this film.
