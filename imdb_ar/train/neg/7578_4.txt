The motion of "Super, ick American Style" (1973), which refers to at least a long version of a television movie called "Love, American Style," filmed with a glitter of nudity, is a piece of fluff that is still capable On the entertainment. The prominent figure here, Tara B. True, really kind of supernatural softness. A hostess (not a flight attendant) so well-dressed that even the autopilot of her plane passed her (!), And with her intimate boyfriend at each outlet, this two-winged galaxy really puts "put" in a "stop". What with the New York-based Juro Group surgeon, flattered by the problems of the Miami gangs, and her rock star who defied creativity in Los Angeles, Tara sure does not keep busy. When these men do not exhaust themselves with all their masculine energy, as the viewer learns, they are exposed to karate lessons, batons at high miles, flashers and rapists, and attend grand parties and stop the attempted hijacking on her plane. . As I said, fun, fun, and definitely good to spend the night when you feel you are somewhat dead and just want vegetables in front of the tube. A future astrologer, Joyce Gelson, has succeeded in giving a certain amount of extra magic to her role in Tara's film, and the film seems to be enough to please. Disappointingly, Osim DeGard and Marie Gavin (known as Candy Samples) were killed in the 1970s in very small roles, but still have to do what they do best - offer their minds! Although the picture is not funny at all and does not contain a lot of ideas in its head metaphorically, it succeeds in being entertaining constantly, and I think this is something. Strangely, the end credits must draw attention to Mrs. Gelson's body double, but; I do not think I've seen it before!
