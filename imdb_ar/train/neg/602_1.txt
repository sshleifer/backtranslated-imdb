Another example of the total waste of UK lottery funds. How commercial did not prove this film. The movie board, which financed this miserable waste, at one of London's abandoned subway stations, should be allowed to allow this vulgar, vulgar specimen to commit to the film, a half-veiled feature of all the horror films that the director saw and felt appropriate to the tradition, most notably Deathline. Among its many failures is the apparent failure to make the leading personality sympathetic remotely until the last minute. It's too late! Certainly all development executives, at the Film Council in the UK, may have noticed this at the stage of the scenario. Add to that the terrible representation and funny appearance of the creature and you will get a prime example of how not to fear.
