It's one of the funniest things about being small and easily fooled by advertising. I've already talked about another film, where the commercial of comedy seems more entertaining than it is. Made me see this advertised in 1981 I think this would be a very funny film. What I did not know with my brother and saw with me was that the scene used in television advertising was the last scene in the film! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything in the film before, I can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use! The last scene is, thanks to the young dose, Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long-bearded old man, to a bright young Asian / Elvis like a rock star! (Because the players did not keep a backup!) <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers was appointed in the 1930s without any real reason, but he did not give any really good reason to "comedy" moments. The rest of the representatives were just boring and my brother and I sat throughout this barely laughing at anything. It was natural to expect a comedy of the "Pink Panther" type, and Peter Sellers was very wonderful at it. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this is his last film before his death. His appearance in Muppet was more entertaining than this erroneous twist. Still, I do not miss it. Everyone who took part in it was mistaken because he did not try to make a better film than this. 2 stars being cream!
