With this line, a silly British science fiction film begins. The Great Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" builds a transmission machine only to cut off his funding through Blanchard, the bearded man who has something for bow ties and big-boned men. When his experience fails, the good doctor knows that Limbach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to show himself at Blanchard's house with the help of his beautiful laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, there was something wrong and it ended up like a rat. The rest of the film is devoted to the good orange-haired doctor who walks around London and is shocked by the people and his mutilated hand and wearing diapers on his face. There are more murders, some modest paperwork, and finally, the doctor disappears to where the doctors who face the mice go. Thankfully, no one has decided to do a supplement.
