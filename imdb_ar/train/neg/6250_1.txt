I really liked this show, once. That is, until I realized all the flaws in it. It's very unrealistic. I know this is a fantasy, but it is not even the least believable thing. Here's why. Spoilers before people ... ** Are we really supposed to believe that a child like Yuji will descend from the Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Come on! He is the biggest nerd on earth. What is the matter in Pharaoh's poetry (such as Atim and / or Yami)? The last thing I examined, the pharaohs were shaved (except for a little hair over their heads) and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be convinced that the genius of a wicked little boy named Seto Kaiba can run a legally successful business while still spending time to go to a poor little school like Domino High? PUH-leeze! First, you must be a legal adult to manage a company. This would make him really not a genius, because he would be the only adult person in his class. Second, why did he attend a school like Domino Hay, when it was clear that his business was successful enough to attend a reckless academy? In addition, side plots with his little brother are very happy and lame. Every time you turn around, this kid is kidnapped by fools for the sake of the beggar. * Yawning * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor child who lives with a good father. She says Joey earns all the money to go to school because his father is addicted to alcohol, but you never see Joey doing anything like work. So it does not mention work. And his sister serenity is a complete fool. Why would she choose an imitator like Duke (who wore her brother in a dog's costume and publicly insulted him on television) on a gentle man like Tristan? Are they really ignorant? Various characters throughout the show, possessed by satanic forces, robbed by demonic forces and prey to mental illness. (Oh, this is safe for children, not). Tea is the type of girl next door model, the only purpose of which is to be a girlfriend Yugi / Yami. Although she has some brilliant points, she does not have enough time to shine as a main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is simply terrifying. All characters look nauseous and loss of appetite. The perspectives are awful (especially when they make close-ups from someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not astral. <br /> <br /> But the worst plot in the chain was the fact that Yami says that the Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. If so, how did the grandfather save Yugi in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul, and saves himself from having difficulty retrieving it? <br /> <br /> Everything that is in fact, is trading for itself. Its only positive aspect is the "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more important. Like, see the short version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
