When discussing a film called "Snakes on an Airplane", we must point out early that snakes are very important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a very bad Seiji snake that does not look or move like real snakes. Snakes are scary because they look soft and crawl and slide. These snakes do nothing like that. They slip as if they were in a video game. They are cartoon snakes. I will go even further to say that even a person who has been plagued with great phobia against real snakes will not find those terrified terrifying. Why on earth do you want to include extreme fluctuations of these failures? Why not rely on suspense .. The whole morality "less is more". Or better still, why not make it look good in the first place? Then maybe still use them frugally <br /> <br /> Take one look at the John Carpenters "thing". Here we have the real mud, the gore of strange dimensions. Passed 20 years ago, we got a pile of sfx snake crap "on board". When do these people wake up and drink coffee? Special effects go back! <br /> <br /> Surely you can say .. But the movie is a joke, do you get it? Sure I'm with this idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this film has a nonsense dialogue. Music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I can handle every other actor as part of this film, except Jackson. What was he doing there? The man who has starred in the Pulp Fiction 10 years ago. Is this career advancement? Do you offer people value for money? No. I would like to know what Tarantino thought when he was halfway through this stinky movie <br /> <br /> It looks like the current generation has very low expectations. Hollywood seems to offer them what they want. When I left for the cinema, I saw a number of ads for some really dreadful future releases, including ... DOA: Dead or Living, (Another) Animal CGI called "Wipe", and another comedy film looking "click". In addition I saw some terrifying trailers, including one about (another) crap horror / British comedy. I have never seen filmmaking in such a mess for a long time. <br /> <br /> I expect to see this movie on sale in the DVD deal section for one pound in six months. And if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of snakes with a gorgeous appearance, and a cool cool cool dialogue comes from the lips of samuel l jacksons. forget that.
