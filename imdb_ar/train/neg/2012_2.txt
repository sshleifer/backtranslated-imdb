Life in some future fascism or near the fascist state that severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurring theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such actions disseminate warnings about unwanted trends in our society that must be observed; but to be effective they must be entertaining as well. Unfortunately, most books may be more effective in spreading warnings of entertainment to us enough to become widely read; while the problem is usually in the opposite direction. The first such work has become widely known, perhaps entitled "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), and still available in the form of a book and a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read: Then, when you feel a bit depressed about human inhumanity, you can reach Cinderella 2000. This is a lightweight, lightweight budget comedy based on the same theme that offers a simple but unbeatable show. ; As in 1984, the calendar has now passed its previous validity period. Most comedy is put with a shovel although there are a few really funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long term between these periods, you can focus on whether this movie will gain a new life by releasing it as a DVD or whether it will eventually disappear into oblivion with the deterioration of past tape versions. There are many worse movies that appear as DVDs these days, and frankly, I do not care much what happens in both cases. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best film of this genre so far is "The Maid's Tale," but I will happily exchange them for a well-made film from the prestigious London novel The Iron Hill. Because of his ambition, it still seems unbelievable that no modern filmmaker has dared to experiment with him (IMDb lists only a silent copy of B / W made in Russia in 1919).
