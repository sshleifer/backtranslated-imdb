This movie was on TV the other day, and I never enjoyed it. George I of the woods was a good comedy, but the sequel .... absolutely awful. The new actress and actress, who played leadership roles, was not good at all; she was supposed to have the original actor Brendon Fraiser and the original actress (I forgot her name) so that this film gets a rating of 0 out of ten, not a movie you can sit and watch and enjoy It is a movie that turns into another channel or returns it to the store if it is rented or purchased. It was good to see the monkey's return, but it was not as enjoyable as the first, they should have had a new George as the son of George grew up, and had still had Bridon and (what she addressed) in the film, .
