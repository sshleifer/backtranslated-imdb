I watch a lot of bad movies, a lot !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday almost a group of friends meet and watch garbage from around the world - anything. Turkish super hero films, vampires from Brazil, Italian gorilla films, Kevin Costner movies, and anything except Raising Helen, but I did not watch a movie worse than THEODORE REX. Start. And it's not terribly entertaining in a way Ed Wood Kinda - it just sucks. Now this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was produced because Whoopi removed the gloves and explained to the press and anyone else who would have heard that she hated this piece of CRAP = tried to get out of her contract, while the complainant was complaining, Pour it in this narrow skin future skinny policeman who despises him, jerks! You can just see her get angry while doing - do everything but look for the camera for her agent so you can scream at him. Dinosaurs have about three facial expressions and texts so horrific that the third semester can do better if the cookies are promised.
