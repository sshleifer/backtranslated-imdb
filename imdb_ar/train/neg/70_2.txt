This movie never reached the theaters in our region, so when it became available on DVD, I was the first to hire it. For once, I must listen to the critics and convey this news. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent selection of actors, the film was very disappointing. I can now see why I went directly to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush could have some value. They all did a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was slow and never attracted me. I failed to develop much empathy with the characters and I had to fight the urge to progress quickly to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie even if you're considering renting it for "eye candy" only. Would not satisfy even that.
