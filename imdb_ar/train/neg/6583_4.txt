Interesting idea and story did not work. <br /> <br /> When you see a movie, you may feel dissatisfied with the end as you did. I did not really know who had his root in the film, Tai Deegs looked bored as a detective, and the rest of the characters seemed to be one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirchner) was more than a pretty girl, we may have already enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and bring the culprit to justice. The problem was that she was like the other girl, turning from a sweet girl into an opportunistic cocaine bustle. I can not understand the moral message of this film, and the story of detective and excitement does not work.
