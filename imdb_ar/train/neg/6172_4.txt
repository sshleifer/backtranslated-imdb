I'll get to the movie in one minute. First, someone wanted "evidence" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the United States "deserved" the September 11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first crusade, when the Christian soldiers seized Jerusalem, they first burnt down a synagogue with 300 Jews and began to kill every woman and child who was a Muslim on the Temple Mount, I can tell you The story is still being told today in the Middle East and we are still paying for it. "<br /> <br /> We are still paying for it? Whaddya means "we", paleface? The Marines broke into the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> In fact, Clinton never came out and said unequivocally that we "deserve" 9-11. Like all his statements during his presidency, implicitly we deserved 9-11. Just point to the "truth" A, B, C, and perhaps D, and let the listener conclude that they must add up to the X conclusion. When the truth is, Clinton's "facts" are added to guacamole. <br /> But this is next to the point. We are here to discuss films, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a film, you can not escape his distorted policy. It was only a matter of time before he focused on the paranoia and bitterness of the Reagan era, and what was the best time to realize the dreams of almost sixty, on the day that Reagan almost bought the farm. Unable to find any plots or sinister schemes in an attempt to assassinate Hinckley, he invented one with frenzy. From a simple misunderstanding to the constitutional power chain, Hage turned from a public official who should in fact have been interested in civic education in his paranoid delirium. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "Release the Hounds". Even Stone is recruiting the most intelligent people in Hollywood to play the role of our former foreign minister, Richard Dreyfus. A man loves to hate him in full view. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is fine. Average, hovering below average. Do not bother renting or buying. Try to catch him on the cable. 4 of 10.
