It is a very strange film ... I was not really sure of the subject, some strong N in London find a muted child in the forest all think that it is a kind of Oracle in a way that makes them all their own way is nothing about their lives ends in disaster. The film ended after about 90 minutes, which made me feel very dissatisfied, almost upset by the futility of everything. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them had a chance to tell the audience. <br /> <br /> What is the message? Am I gloomy? It was just too weird. What happens to the enemy? Why does Emilio shoot the baby? ... This makes no sense at all, meaningless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of film?
