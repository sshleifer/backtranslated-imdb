I started watching this film with low expectations, in fact I noticed it only because it was adapted to S.K. Novel (novel I have never read). <br /> <br /> I'm happy because my expectations were low because the film was not close to good, but it runs your attention. What really draws this story is the work done by the director and actors. The movie is stretched, there are no "nice" shots and no scares, stupid dialog boxes and special nonsense effects. <br /> <br /> The only good things are, as I said, they keep you interested (I think the book should be good) without using a lot of scary cliches. <br /> <br /> My voice is 4/10.
