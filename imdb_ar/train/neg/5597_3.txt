I will say that the film is at least logical, but bad. The representation for the most part is not good (I think Sky just showed no promise) and you feel embarrassed when you watch it. All the scenes should be really shallow meaning, just as Ng happens to her parents. There are a lot of amazing details, such as the Kanji tattoo on Sky's shoulder, the magnets in the girls' fridge and the impressive decor in sets ... music ... clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been such a movie. The boy says at some point "I'm gay, not rude." Not aware. So the comment was awful, it was shut down after Ng talked about how strange she was in playing lesbian.
