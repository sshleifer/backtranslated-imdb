Did anyone else notice where they were in the car each time the camera took a new angle to change the roads. As in one scene, it is a single lane apartment with sidewalks, beside it is located on a multi-lane highway with a divider, next to a rural road consisting of lanes with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget, but that was just a filthy movie work. <br /> <br /> I also read other reviews and disagreed with it was a bad film. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and a comedy you might enjoy this movie. However, if his / her works are found / not funny, I recommend that you stay away from this work.
