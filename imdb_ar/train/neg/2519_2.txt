I paid an interview to watch this film in the theater. <br /> <br /> It will get one rating, but fighting scenes between robots are okay, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies may be the most suffering on a small budget for obvious reasons. But one way that this film failed is that each piece of each group looks cheese and cheap. I mean, can not they even make it "look" good? <br /> <br /> The other main reason for this film is the terrible act of acting. If I saw the film now and I knew what to expect, I would only enjoy the cheese factor, but at the time I was expecting a good film and I had no idea how much The magnificence of it all in the end. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was over in just 85 minutes.
