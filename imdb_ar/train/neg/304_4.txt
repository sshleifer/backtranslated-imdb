This film portrays Ruth as a female sports personality, as well as alcoholics, gambling and over-eating with little baseball. Babe Ruths was very interesting early and this was for all purposes and purposes that were deleted in this film. Also, Le Guerig was barely covered and this was a good relationship, bad good or indifferent, it should have been better covered than it was. His life was more than anything bad. He was an American hero, an icon many of the great baseballers were designing their lives. I feel fair to the memory of a great baseball player completely ignoring this film. Shame on the makers of this film to take advantage of his mistakes and not his greatness.
