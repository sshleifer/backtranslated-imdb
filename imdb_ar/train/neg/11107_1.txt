This was a terrible film. There was no story line at all. In the first place, when they could not explain the blood and dose (the only good part) ... thrown in a few foreigners! I hate when the directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the foreigners! Watch this movie if you like. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: How can Finney say the word "welcome" when he does not have a tongue? Unfortunately, Mr. Jones did not have a bigger role. The second thing that made me feel guilty was why we showed Winnie Jones's boils and cut him and put him in a blue liquid, and then he had no extra role. why not? I do not like to show anything and nothing to do with the lines of the story at all. In short. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I wish I had seen mirrors instead.
