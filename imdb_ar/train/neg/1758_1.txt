If you have not seen this yet, I just say move, walk in the garden, and do not waste your time. Neither script nor representation is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide what is the worst: the film itself or Baldwin hairstyle? Elaine Bombo's talent in acting is highly questionable and I hope you can improve it over time. The story is just incredible. Loose American policeman cannon fighting criminals in Europe alone ?? The notorious Slavic mafia is protected by only two pieces ??? A teacher of passionate arts leads a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police executive of hammer bag ??? Give me a break. There is one good thing about this film, though: at least, production costs must be less than "Ocean's 12" which was meaningless and above the film.
