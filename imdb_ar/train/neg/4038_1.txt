To sit down how awful it is, you should write pages and pages, so just say it's a monument to bad guidance. <br /> <br /> "When managers go thin" it should have been the title of this production. In fact, directors are supposed to give their work a sense of the visual style and storytelling that pushes the story forward. <br /> <br /> How does the camera shake continuously and play with the "style" zoom lens? How is the story going forward? Of course there is also nonsense "editing by random numbers". It seems that it has just become a random hip cut. <br /> <br /> I think it is very necessary to make good adjustments. <br /> <br /> Well, I've made it very much for most people to watch The Armor that he has developed as one of the most excessive and unattended performances of all time.
