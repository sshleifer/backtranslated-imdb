With the story of a script that seems to have been written by a high school, the "art of seduction" failed to offer a sophisticated romantic experience trying to describe itself. The two main characters have the ability to be fun - both male and female are "single swing (or female)", but the "art of seduction" does not even try. In more detail than an explicit examination of these two characters, the "art of seduction" avoids anything intrinsic on the basis of the high and meager stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The Art of Seduction" is an insult - an insult to its characters, an insult to men and women, an affront to the expectations of its masses. It takes the most beautiful people we all know and play their painful reactions while expecting us to empathize with them. Ji-Wan is immature, spoiled, bitch manipulation. The viewer is expected to admire and forgive her flaws because she is beautiful. Min Jun, well, is exactly the same. No nice people. The "humor" in this film revolves around the attempts of Ji-Wan and Min-Min alien to overcome each other in the art of honor, lying and manipulation. There is no evolution in character, and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are similar. We simply expect to take it as it is, and not ask questions - it's nice! , That's all that matters. The heavy references to celebrities are the main actors in the reviews of the movie Scenery may guide you to the shallow "art of seduction." <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, I loved Grease, or you were a victim of yellow fever, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Romance" tag, this is not a very good movie history.
