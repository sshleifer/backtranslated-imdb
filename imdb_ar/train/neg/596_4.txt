Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the massive horror of the classic softness of the 1970s, "The Line of Death", which was ironic that such cavalry, as was partly filmed at the abandoned Duyuk metro station. <br /> <br /> Of the currently abandoned Jubilee Line platforms in Charing Cross, in addition to the aforementioned Duhish, this film basically contains the same plot - the zombie murder in tunnels that take advantage of missing passengers who have lost the last train - authenticity is not strong for this film Point. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are strong points, unfortunately. The size of the rose ranges from the poor to the poor too much, while the glute under the gloom is not entirely interpreted as more than just a piece of developed land. <br /> <br /> Frank Bullent has nothing to do with anything thin. The scenario of running in many tunnels and shouting often, was actually like everyone else in this movie, surpassed by a small dog and a group of tame rats. <br /> <br /> If it's creepy, the movies that are shown on London Underground are your bag, or you just want to turn on "Locate the Tube" where they pick it up on a DVD when it hits a box of bargains. If you're looking for classic horror, go and dig a copy of Death Line (also known as Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good-quality, well-written movie, you'll need to change trains .....
