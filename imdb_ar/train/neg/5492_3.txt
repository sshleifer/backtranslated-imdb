People at Disney have a lot to explain. First of all, why would anyone think that these less comics articles would even make a decent half-moving picture. In the 60-teleplay of Kooky, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us was not granted after the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Exotic visions of young young men have long been dispelled by the likes of ET, CLOSE ENCUNTERS and ALINENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> The magic of the property was mainly due to the lovely relationship that arose between the late Bill Pixby like Tim and Rayston as a non-earthly visitor. It was conceived that Mars had an antenna that looked like a dobby at the time. Now it looks positively positive. However, Christopher Lloyd, Martin's uncle, is attached to metal accessories. In an early shot, the antenna on the TV Tim is supposed to make Mars work! When the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, right? <br /> <br /> Disney does not trust strangers or relationships and overshadow this effect with special effects that attract the attention of young people, including a space suit called Zoot! Yes, I read it correctly - you speak silver suit Uncle Martin. It's supposed to be a real hilarious chop! Figure again. Got the funnier rubber stockings from Zoot. When the movement is lagging (and constantly delayed), the computer graphics are turned on to activate things. Tim plays here by friendly Jeff Daniels, who can not (or does) do anything to save this disturbing mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to the role of her neighbor's lady. Even Ray and Sixty himself were dragged with pain in the proceedings - but to no avail. This foreign visitor died on arrival. <br /> <br /> The ongoing talk about the sitcoms that turn to the screen makes me only hope that I DREAM OF JEANNIE will not show a talking harem group. I pray that Samantha cat in the film BEWITCHED has no lines. I live in fear that I love LUCY - the film will proudly show CG Conga Drum named Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your leader.
