Although Misty Ayers is certainly attractive as a blonde leader, this click is just an excuse to let her strip off her underwear several times (without nudity in 1954 when this film was made; not 1965). <br /> <br /> The man he rents up to work at the Abb Abbott & Costello whorehouse.

Some of these "exploitation films", which are usually produced later after this film, are interesting in one way or another, but this is a very exciting festival. Mr. Milton (make room for father) directed. There are some facial expressions like Samurai and interesting apartments, but there is nothing here.
