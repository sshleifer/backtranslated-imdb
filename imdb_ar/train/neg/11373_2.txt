It is not clear from watching this film (so I recommend viewers to look at the people who are presenting their case), but this presentation about the reality of Islam, and its promotion of violence and intolerance against non-Muslims lacks objectivity, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. One of the things to be documented is that the Qur'an says many things about how to ask a religious Muslim to interact with non-Muslims, but any real person can realize that not everyone feels himself or is a follower of Islam, will agree with all the principles of this faith and order and comply with it. There's a reason to raise a lot of questions about bidders, so viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; do not swallow everything, hook, line, and dive, without thinking about your personality. <br /> <br /> For example, a specific person searches for Walid Shuaibat, who claims to be a former Muslim who committed a terrorist act in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in any of these assertions. Neither I nor I am Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am neither a Christian nor a member of faith. But I am a smart and distinguished person. While the film is very disturbing, in its presentation of how some Muslims see their commitment to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than fundamentalist views. Like fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are differences in the intensity of faith and commitment between Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, you must have a hand salt shaker. One pill will not be enough, you'll need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is being presented, assess the state of the world, and how Islam fits with that based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, suggesting a clear bias. Be your own mind.
