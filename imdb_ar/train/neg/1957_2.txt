I enjoyed this film most of the time, but I kept feeling that I was watching a children's film. I honestly think that someone wrote a small scenario, then during filming, he decided to add some blood, nudity and language. It was a big let down. There is a belief that the magic of children is found in films such as "Babe" or "Angels Abroad" which defeats the evil fairy fairy. The parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and take advantage of this skill to defeat the supernatural fairy teeth. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a response to B movies to the awful dark falls; somehow managed to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they did not. They made a worse film and probably lose the same percentage of money lost when the dark falls.
