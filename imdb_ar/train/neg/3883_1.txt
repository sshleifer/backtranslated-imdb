No, just kidding. It was great. <br /> <br /> I was watching my local science fiction station last night, which shows movies every night, on a monthly theme. This month "space Turkey, or: how I learned to stop worrying and love bombs." Movies are too bad, should not be made. This was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is very bad with two exceptions, make-up JUR (which showed potential) and editing (done by the rest of the film a bit, in terms of being awesome). Representation is terrible everywhere, dialog box is terrible, scenario, direction. It's not a good film. <br /> <br /> It consists of two shapes of special effects, a large area of ​​images. I will focus on Gore. When I watched this movie, I thought to myself, "What is the motive behind this film industry?" People certainly love making things, but I was reluctant to think that anything good could come for anyone concerned. I came to the conclusion that this film was made as a way to increase the demonstration of Make-up Effects. Rick Becker actually went to a beautiful career. He worked in STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and even The Shrinking Woman (1981), as well as a number of other notable hits. Other than that, I can not say that I have actually seen a real man and a real, incredible or other - but I must say that this seems to be a fair representation of one of them. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of a bad adjustment, I usually think of a scene where someone may be talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone moves to his shoulder, or something in that sense. This film really highlights the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, the scenes are long and completely useless. Almost every scene lasted too long, from a little dead air to a long crazy screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. This head is cut into the river, the head is thrown into the river (slow motion), the film continues for a few minutes, then back to the floating head and watch it fall into a waterfall. While I'm sure they're all very proud of their cropped head, what the hell? <br /> <br /> Finally, I will mention the scene of the fat lady / slow motion near the beginning. The slow, volatile motion tells me that they did not shoot the scene with a slow motion originally, but later decided that it "did not work that way" and then slowed it down. Hey vey. However, if you are supposed to see another movie in which a hysterical woman walks into a hall and then straight through a closed glass door - all in a slow motion, keep in mind - remember the incredible melting man, because this is where he started everything. <br /> <br /> It's best to watch movies like this at home with a group of friends. This device is slow most of the time, but it takes a long time to get to your lines. It's not the worst thing, but it's very bad.
