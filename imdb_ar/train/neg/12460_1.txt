We surrendered at the point where George Clooney's fingernails were extracted. We were not very sensitive - after sitting for an hour in this group of leadership, we knew what I felt. To say this movie was incomprehensible, boring, the buzz file will be praise it! How did people manage to sit in this slow false corner and depression of a movie, not to mention his Oscar nomination? Clooney looked sick as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. And what was with that translation? - Do we only have DVD dud or was the original movie done in this way - I left the strings hanging in the air? The film was hard enough to follow without it too. I pity the cast, who did his best with the material available.
