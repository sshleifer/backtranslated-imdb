Funny how the studio thinks it could be a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with a completely new crew expected to float. They certainly used different actors for Batman, but in that case Batman was a classic figure before any actor wore his head. In this case, you had a classic figure in blond-haired blond-haired Ralphy-wearing glasses that wanted a red pistol on Christmas... Somehow, we should forget that and accept another little boy unlike the original. - If I did not know it was a complement to what I had guessed from the cast ... except of course Charles Gruden tries to imitate Darren McGowan to the extent that your character is constantly reminded that the original was much better ... In the end There may be work if they film better. They should have looked for a look they simply liked or ignored, not trying to copy the look and feel. This one is just a cheap imitation. Raleigh does not raise any sympathy just wanting his character to look or die.
