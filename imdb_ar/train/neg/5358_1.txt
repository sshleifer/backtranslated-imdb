It is clear that all the good reviews published for this film so far are insiders who participated in the film or who know someone who knows someone and have seen multiple extracts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, I have seen the final conclusion, a pure trash. The only thing that happens is the ambition and multiple version of horror legends (nothing on the screen for a terribly long time). It seems as though filmmakers made the film on a weekend at a horror conference and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Periman to film scenes during coffee breaks. This is a wannabe X-Files very cheap price, filmed on video with a terrible representation of a group of unqualified representatives who have a larger number of columns than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no work; it is an overly illustrative dialogue that seeks to explain a meaningless plot. The FX computer is a joke, but there is not enough of it and there is not enough action to make the movie fun in MST3K. After about 8 continuous scenes of speech only, you will find yourself heading towards the fast forward button ... and do not leave it. Not worth it at all.
