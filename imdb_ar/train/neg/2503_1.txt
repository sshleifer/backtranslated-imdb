It's a bad excuse to make the new Zealnd movie. I am ashamed to call myself "New Zealand" when this movie is on display on New Zealand's satellite television (August 2006). The staff consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship is, in fact, one of the ferries between the islands that travel daily between the two main islands, and even the company logo (Dolphin) still exists throughout the group including the ship's suppression. The vessel is supposed to be a maritime vessel / ferry between the United States of America and Mexico. It has clear signs of rust and aging everywhere but it is supposed to be a luxury vessel on its first trip. One scene shows snow peaks covered by New Zealand's southern island in the background for God's sake! It must be a very cool time in the USA / Mexico area! The story is weak, the representation is weaker and the New Zealand / American accent does not work. I expect the New Zealand taxpayer to have contributed to the cost of producing this film and it was a waste of money that was better spent on real production. I know New Zealand high school kids who can make better movies using their mobile phones. Geek: There's a truck waiting with marks on it and the Taco sign stuck on the door of the truck, supposed to make it look like an American. But some signs are above the top of the markings - you think they have noticed it in the props section before attaching it. I like to keep going, but it is not worth the hassle in any way.
