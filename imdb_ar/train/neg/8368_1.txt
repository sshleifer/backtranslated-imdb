When you watch a small man, you will spend time running them trying to figure out many of the plot holes. This is not a good sign because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You're supposed to laugh at it !! But you will probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little guy is his concept - it's very ridiculous that can not be accepted (even as a comedic comedy), so when the loud, serious jokes and the jokes start, they make it all seem stupid 10 times more Than it is now. <br /> <br /> "But comedy" some of you may be screaming. This is true but there is no excuse for such a stupid plot. I mean, come on, think about it if you see a child with a big man face, would you be less suspicious? If Calvin wanted to hide diamonds heavily, why not put him in a nearby shelf instead of a random women's handbag? How can a qualified doctor not realize that Calvin is a grown man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about laughing." Well what you see thing, there is hardly any laughter in the little guy and this makes the dumb ass plot stand out more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a comedy for brothers and Ian with faith in suspending the plot, hold on to the white chicks because at least there was a little decent laugh.
