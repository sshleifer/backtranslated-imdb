If you do not mind playing your emotions, you will not mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy the secrets of British crime, follow the clues and see how they all fall into place in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical contradictions that lead to this disappointment: <br /> <br /> While police use CCTV cameras early to gather clues about the puzzle, the huge truck that stopped and closed the view Children before their disappearance directly camera. This is a crucial piece of mystery. It is not consistent to have the car where the children are sitting on the camera and not the large truck that is critical to the puzzle. <br /> <br /> * The film extends to the extreme to show the evolution of equipment in tracking down the movements of children but miss the opportunity to take advantage of the same advanced equipment is to track vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from the sites of video cameras next to the crime scene as part of the development of clues . <br /> <br /> In England, drive on the left. The manager gets out of his way to get the car in the crime scene garden on the right, a few meters from the flower stall, when it could have been parked easily behind him directly, or even on the side; as did the huge truck. <br /> <br /> The police forensics team is so thorough that a cell phone disposed of in sewage can be found several miles away from the scene of the crime, but no blood evidence can be found directly from the head injury The crime scene, although it secured the place after only hours of disappearance and without overlapping rain. <br /> <br /> * No search dogs were ever used to find missing children; this is a country famous for developing hunting and hunting dogs. <br /> <br /> * It makes no sense that this famous story does not lead to the appearance of the innocent truck driver who stopped at the flower stall. <br /> <br /> * Does not it make sense for a mother to go to these extreme cases and do a lot of effort to leave threads of carpet fibers under her nails for the investigators in the killing in the end? Himself - while they simply can not crawl from a mobile home unguarded. If she has enough sense to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her fingernails, she can easily ask her daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. > <br /> * The suspect who abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow / faint - the reason for his unknown sinking. However, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also exercise his rights fully in self-incrimination. <br /> <br /> More contradictions like this will lead to real disillusionment. "Five Days" is a very weak British crime story.
