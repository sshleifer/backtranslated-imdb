You do not see this movie if you like classics like TOM WOPAT, John Schneider, BACHINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, and BEN JONES! This movie will spoil you! First of all, this movie begins with Bo Run and Luke's Laugh for Gossip. Bo and Luke will not do so on the real series! This film depicts unimaginable characters doing things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respectful of the law. In this film, he is a criminal who makes a cannibal gang with the governor of Georgia. In addition, if this is an extension added to the Reunion Hazard Dukes! I have Dazzar Hazard in Hollywood, I have one question: How could Jessie fail to make human beings when he died before Des Hazards in a Hollywood movie? And how is the pig alive when he died before the film was reunited in 1997! The film Rosie Ran Hazard? It seems magical that these characters came back to life, when they died for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wants to make a good film, it must return James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wapat, Benn Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and make a family-friendly film with live original characters that made the show what was and still is compared to this disgusting movie! If you want to watch good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy a set of 2 DVD discs including Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both star cast original, family friendly! Do not waste your time in a movie that does not deserve the CD-ROM written on it!
