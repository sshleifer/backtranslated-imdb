Unfortunately, this movie is very bad. The origin of Out of Towners was very humorous and funny, of course they used the text written by Neil Simon. For some reason, the Neil Simons script is not used in this movie, so it falls over and over again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The trend is very slow and boring, and when there is a joke, it is discarded until the joke dies, that is, the couple has sex in the garden. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, we know very well that the lights will come and we will be able to see the beautiful and wonderful Goldie & Steve with a slap stick. The entire film concludes being like this ... A joke has been set up and given away. Why not wear the hair of Goldes in the film. You'll also notice every close-up of the Goldie (using a soft, ultra-dense lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
