My friend and I rented this movie for $ 2.50. We both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> This is the worst film ever made! <br /> <br /> Also, my friend and I have returned 475 facial shots. (Which make up 95% of the film). <br /> <br /> In other words: Do you see this movie unless you love wasting money! And I do! <br /> <br />
