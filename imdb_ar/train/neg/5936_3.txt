This film was a disaster from start to finish. With presentations from "The Next Generation of Beautiful Losers" interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for Leonard Cohen himself, who hovers over everyone else in the film with his gentle leadership, wisdom and humor. The rest are very busy trying to adapt them as Saint Leonard or the prophet of the Old Testament. Many of the presentations are inexplicable explanations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or poor performances. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got a stunning distance from Leonard's releases by using a little restraint. Fake little fake gestures throughout the film - such as red-spot focus overlays on many concert clips and interviews, unclear blurred camera work, the use of digital delay in some of Leonard Cohen's comments to hear what is being said) and a low-pitched unmanned aerial plane Interviews (try gravitas added?). For the real thing, see The Life Of Life documentary produced by the BBC in 1988.
