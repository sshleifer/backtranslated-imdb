I love the portrayal of the 1930s and 1940s in the film. I love Salma Hayek I was more than willing to like this picture. But . . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No sir, nothing good in this regard. The only entertainment aspect for me is the character of Colin Farrell, an unsafe writer, and this scenario, despite addressing the theme of juicy racism, approaches the audience in a special way ABC Afterschool. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not appear to be "acting" was Sutherland, and was a few minutes away. <br /> <br /> The meaningless approach was a tiring plot.
