Believe me, I wanted to love the "soul". The stupid comments made by people at the time when it was released about how strange the old and hand-painted animation was once again, as if the last animated cartoon of the pencil had been exported twenty years ago, the most stupid comments about how computers now made ancient techniques obsolete, I raised my blood ... but then, the indecent and indecent nonsense that I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" raised my blood more. <br /> <br /> The designs of public figures, animations (partly as a result) are only qualified, the artistic direction as a whole is completely, and the dullness is so dull that you wonder how it could have happened (we know, from "Prince of Egypt" and " Eldorado, "that there are talented artists in DreamWorks), and the evolving use of CGI is in every bad situation. (Why do they care?) There is one thing worth searching for. In a moving cartoon, this is deadly. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> Horses can not talk, but they are much more stereotypical and unconvincing than deer in Bambi, which can. The horses seem to talk in some way. Spirit presents itself in the introduction (looks like the whole world like a 21st century actor picked from a mall in California), and since then, his certainly uncertain accounts of soundtracks are no longer vague, although he never tells us anything We did not really know him or express a feeling that the artwork, though weak, was not able to express it twice. This introduction, by the way: (a) contains information that spirit, as we later discovered, knew the way to know; (b) expresses ideas that the spirit lacks to express even if spoken. (C) rubbish includes a new era such as, "This story may not be true, but that's what I remember"; and (d) will give countless children (production is produced, I suppose, in children aged six years) It is a native native of North America, and this is fairly true, since it is a common ancestor of local horses, zebras etc. It was native to North America - but all kinds of horses on the continent were extinct long before the arrival of early humans. The swamps of the herd of the spirit (supposedly "belonging here like buffalo grass") descended from the horses introduced by the Europeans. <br /> <br /> So the introduction to the introduction has bothered me somewhat. <br /> <br /> Spirit often sings, Brian Adams, seems as normal as if he had a bad ring infection - not that he sings or even how he sings, he sings: stories that contribute less, if possible, From Sprite's spoken novel, which looks as if they all have exactly the same tone (although I was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably did not). If Brian Adams and the man who pretends to be a horse can be silent for a minute or two, the film may have been allowed to take its true form: medium and derivative, rather than bad jaw.
