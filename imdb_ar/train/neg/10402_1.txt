Well ... the first tremors, the original started in 1990 and I found the movie very interesting to watch. However, they proceeded to make the second and third tremors. Trust me, those movies started heading down just after I finished my first movie, I mean, ass blinking ??? Now, God alone is able to answer the question "Why in the name of the gods will they create another one of these dives from the trash film?" The fourth tremors can not be considered a bad film, and in fact can not be considered an example of a bad film, because it lives more than that. When I tried to sit down though, I noticed that my eyes were starting to bleed, and I was desperately hoping that the little girl would creep out of the ring over the TV and kill me. Did they really think that wearing clothes for people who stared at other films like they were from the Wild West would make the movie (with exactly the same repetition) better? Frankly, I never suggest buying this movie, which means there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
