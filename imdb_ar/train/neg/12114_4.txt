Strange people living in a town go to their lives. There is the man who licks everything, the dumpster finds a body that takes her home to live with her, a crazy girl with a doll wearing her like, and a man who wants to cleanse the girls of their evil ways ... Extremely odd, this shot in black and white films is better without the color. Monochrome takes the edge off two steps of the home movie feel. Like Troma, this is a fun and appropriate movie, but it is often strange to foreigners and quickly becomes disrupted because one sees a range of games that you can guess, where it goes a lot of time - not always but enough to be fun That I have not seen the cleansing coming). Well worth a great experience if you do not have something else you can watch while you wait for the next group of Golden Girls to arrive at Netflix.
