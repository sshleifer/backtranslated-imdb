1) I am not an expert on weapons, but so can I see the difference between US Army rifles in World War I and World War II. In the film, we can see the armed conservatives of "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not the original "1903 Springfield" (also known as "Silent Death"), used by the private sector until World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times the shooting rate! M1 was semi-automatic, and Springfield requires reloading after each snapshot. simple difference ?! 2) German army uniforms were borrowed from 1940 as well. Special - helmets. German helmets until the end of World War I have a large shaft at the top, we can not even see one in the film. If we do a little more archival research - how true is this "true story"? I am surprised to what extent the "honest" directors can be directors of the pursuit of cheap publishing.
