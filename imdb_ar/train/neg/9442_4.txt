I tried to love this moderator, just as I try to enjoy all the bright films. I mean the reckless slaughter mixed with some nudity and some suspense, how can you make a mistake. But I think this is an example of this formula that is going wrong. The main issue is the terrible representation of the three main girls who fell into the house. It was as if they were under anesthesia, and that prevented me from paying attention to their plight. The film aims to thrill and creep but the direction of the figures interrupts and leaves the film boring. It is shameful, because if the film was performed better, it would have been done. The story and figures are very creepy and there are some dark moments and an exotic sense of humor from the interaction between the mother, the girl and the daughter in the old house. There is some good nudity, accidental bloodshed, not enough to give the film the kick he needs. The end is crooked and pretty scary, and they do not give the movie a big boost but alas, not too late yet. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love vague mysterious movies. There is a lot of potential, but the film offers so little that it is not worth it.
