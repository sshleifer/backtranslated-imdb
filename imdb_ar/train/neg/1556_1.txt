I was China in this film. I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was introducing at that time in Italy and they could not pronounce my real name correctly, so I chose Sheeba and then I added Alahani because it was like Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I did not act before (and this shows), but it was very fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously were not helpful). Call my voice name (thank God). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were an explosion on the group, full of humor and jokes. This film was not supposed to be taken seriously, it was written off according to internal information. <br /> <br /> I give her number 1 because I'm in a good humor, but number 10 for fun I had a "representation" in it.
