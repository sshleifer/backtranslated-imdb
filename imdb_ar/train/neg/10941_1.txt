Wow what can I say. I loved the nice movies and got out of my way to watch the flick of the flick, but I was going to carry a snake in the hole of Paul, while my grandmother gave me a lap dance. Lorenzo Lamas, more like Blorino Lamis This man has a measure of acting like Bill Clinton has self control. He has all the goods to make a really bad movie worse. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! Needless shot shot (with real weird scar) Yes! Soundtrack crappy YEP! I wish I could give the movie 10-stars but 1 as low as it goes. Seriously, I think someone was playing a joke on my face when I saw that it could not be real ... The worst thing is having more than two thugs in the eating movie! ...... guess the demand.
