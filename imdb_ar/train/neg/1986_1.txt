You must agree with the other reviewer. This film must be the worst, not to mention the West that I have seen in my life. Terrible representation, a dialogue that was not fantastical and pathetic (not to mention its incompleteness of being supposed to be in the 19th century), and oh, did you mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of a character? I was waiting for the fall of Mike Bum in the middle of a scene. And finally? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... absolutely awful. And yes, it contained all the cliches in the book of slow walking in the dusty road to "Let's remember when" laughable shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw this on a free TV. do not waste your time.
