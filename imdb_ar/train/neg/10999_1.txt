Imagine the worst performances of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90-minute film. Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad stories is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Did you get this? <br /> <br /> Well, go now to see The Underground Comedy. That vision you've just had will look like the most extreme thing of all. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. There was a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Even if the intent of the film was to be lame, it was so lame that it was not funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry about wasting my time watching this is someone else I know he bought. He wasted his money. Vince's presentation did not write or direct anything else, and not surprisingly why.
