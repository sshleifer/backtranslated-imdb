Seriously, I have read some reviews on this film, and I must ask, were you watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the group managers a lot of credit for being able to recreate the 1930 vintage Los Angeles, but what about it? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are loved, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is simply not very well represented. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (And his character "Homer Simpson" make me wish to get the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had a scary child actor, creepy Billy Barty and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those love movies movie lovers and the rest of us look at each other and go, "What a heck!"
