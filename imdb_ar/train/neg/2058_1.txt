I can find very little good to say about this film. I'm sure the idea and the script looked good on paper, but cinematography and acting, which I fear are not the standards I would expect from some talented people. I would like to doubt that these features are extremely biographical in their filmography. Michael Kane sometimes seemed to be a wood in his role as a doctor, and at no time did I really believe in his character. The plot was incredible, especially with regard to the young victim. Some of the scenes reminded us of other films, which I sometimes wondered if they were actually a parody. The lighting was sometimes dark, which made it feel like watching a low-budget movie with some big stars called, wondering why I'd been bothered to see it at all.
