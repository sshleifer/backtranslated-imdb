Bollywood Hail and Men Managers! <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the absolute limit of sacrifice offered by Indian women !! <br /> <br /> The current state of affairs in India, where wives have become more virulent day after day and have wives - directors can also call them "Uncle Scars" (see The Lion King) came up with a whole new concept of how Each of the surviving spouses and the wife can live happily ever after sharing everything with each other ... including sperm! <br /> <br /> The story line: A married couple - very happy - but by chance happens accidentally and the wife is subjected to abortion - lost fetus with the ability to ever become a mother! <br /> <br /> Now in India, the family is usually separated from the father's wife if she fails to grant her an heir! So the wife ran into a grand plan - the surrogate mother ... But the scientists intervened - "certainly artificial insemination" - did not say the artist (actually director) - "The neighborhood will recognize that the father's wife is very barren they are going to the alternative mother !! <br /> < People watching fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the ages of 14 and 40 ... Panties - Well, these neighbors are suddenly taking the upper hand in family planning and decision-making! > <br /> So the wife sends her husband away to the beer bar where the girls dance onstage - most are uneducated and illiterate - but men love it <br /> <br /> He rents the main dancer in the bar - asks her to have her baby - for money - agrees - goes home - becomes pregnant - wife and stays - both coexist in the same house - At the same time, the bitch also feeds on the taste of the house Yves - many people who care - miss them all and silently cry !! At the same time - no one in the family knows that the real daughter in law is walking around with a pillow under a petticoat !! - The mother or other elderly people never took her for tests - and did not try to feel the movements of the child in the womb !!
