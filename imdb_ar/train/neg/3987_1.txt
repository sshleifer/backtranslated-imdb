I came out of very few films before it ended, but I could not finish this trash. This was the biggest burden of racism that has been trying to pass a legitimate film since the birth of a nation. The characters were a little more than cardboard. I do not see how any actor wants to be associated with this film. I have to have better things to do in order to put out such garbage. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do .... like watching paint dry. I hope that someone will make a film about the inter-ethnic relations that dealt with the subject in a realistic way. There is a lot of depth in the subject, the shallow scream of a bitter manager like me.
