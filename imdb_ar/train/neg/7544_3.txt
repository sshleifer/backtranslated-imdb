First, this was not a bad film. It was amusing ... at least for me probably for all the wrong reasons. I have not seen the original before, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of this strange film Christopher Reeve, "The Village of the Damned." Two films have different plots, but this creepy spam and unwanted comedy are present in both. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be a coarse man of mystery / excitement / man, please do not get angry with the female film. I do not know that the whole pagan thing and the sacrifices were a bit distant. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his bad, glorious soul, goes to an isolated island called Summersl when he receives a calligraphy from his long-lost fiancée who claims that her daughter has been hidden and hidden by islanders. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and because he is a tired cop he goes to the almost unknown island and leaves no information about where he is to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> It is even more surprising when illiterate Amish women who fill the island and litter around the place of the lost girl walk around. His fiancé is not the help of who seems to be elusive and exhausting all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the lost girl is his daughter, the lucky man who has been deceived to come to this island as a sacrifice victim during the harrowing festival of the islands. <br /> <br /> In this movie the male does not fare well. View Twisted Patients of Femininity? <br /> <br /> I found the film laughable at times, especially when the cage pierces some women and runs in the bear's dress. I think there is a lot of pits in this film. I find that the whole concept of angry women isolating themselves on an island without any attention to males is very entertaining, but the way they were photographed in this film was strange. While most women have been hurt and angry, it is clearly a form of sexual discrimination. I had closed the movie in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something that can only be seen once or twice. It is not an exciting story that should be classified as strange.
