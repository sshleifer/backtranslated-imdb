Pam Jarir Stars Kofi. She is a nurse seeking revenge on drug traffickers who have made her sister a spoiled heroine. Like any Blaxploitation flick in the 1970s, you can expect to see racist bad guys getting just desserts. <br /> <br /> There were dozens of such films produced during the 1970s, and were already offensive to both black and white audiences. This is mainly due to excessive racial hostility in these films and degrading stereotypes. Especially female figures. <br /> <br /> Another common theme of Coffy, and other films of its kind, is brutal violence, corrupt police, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and women who love sex. Not to mention urban neighborhoods inhabited by drug dealers, pimps, gangs, and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Pam Jarir was an undisputed queen of the 1970's Blaxploitation. It was wonderful, being solid nails, and other wonderful. As in her other films, Pam excels at other characters, in Kofi. In fact, the Pam character is very attractive on screen, so you can not access these types of movies, without being the main character in them. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, it's better to watch her other movies, such as Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have much less rotten, than Kofi does. Pam's character in Kofi, degrades her ability to win the bad guys. Pam characters in her other films Blaxploitation, do not descend to the minimum of revenge, as Kofi did. <br /> <br /> I say, just watch Kofi, if you cant see any of the other Pam Greer movies. Otherwise, Kofi is a waste of time. Pam's talent only as an actress, makes watching Kofi possible.
