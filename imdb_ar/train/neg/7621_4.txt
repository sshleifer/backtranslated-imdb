As noted, this version was filmed several times, most recently "You Got Got Mail," with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Among the many versions, this is my favorite. The problem I think is that the studio has settled on star charisma, which is not quite interrupted here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between qualifications never comes to boiling in this film. There are no real sparks. Both Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the old, cute but cute cake. When the evidence is boring, the rest of the film can only follow it. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she does not have a neck! I do not know if she has a problem with pain or something like that, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it straight into her, all stuffed and everything. I could not know what Van Johnson was. You've made a bee line for this cute violin player. Van was not that great either. I've always thought of him as a leading man in Hollywood, and he does not do anything to dispel that image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or early 20th century, you might want this movie. But there are plenty of entertaining romantic comics out there, and they offer you more than just a lot of stale sweets.
