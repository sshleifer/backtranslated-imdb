The main problem with "energy" is that it also has a way of adding meaningless characters to subsections that add nothing at all to the film at all. The situation becomes dull after a moment, sitting waiting through scenes that do not relate to finding something that drives the film forward. It is likely that everything turns out to be an evolution of characters, but all of them are recycled from previous scenes in the film, or simply flat and uninterested. Lumet does not give enough time to allow any of the dice booster. He had to cut off a few characters (hackman, wife) and focus more on others (Billings). It could have been a great political film rather than a mixed mess, losing any message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that surprised me to think of the cast. Even the performance of Jane Hackman was not equal. Denzel Washington is the only real representative of the note here. Gere and others performed much better elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet needs to return to the fierce man he appears to have done in the 1970s (Serpico) and stop trying to restore his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sydney has not yet worked, and most likely will not succeed. He left the drama band to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
