Without doubt, this is one of the worst images that actually paid my money to see it - the kind of clicks I chose from desperation at the Cinema Mall during the Christmas holidays when I missed the start times for anything good but I'm still dead set on seeing a movie! This is exactly how I came to see this stinking bomb ... <br /> <br /> At the distance of the best part of three decades, I can still smell the rotting fish that make up this storyline. An incredible plot - that killer whale carries a grudge against someone not from the sea - is funny. That's all, except the "Love Theme" is completely complete and is run on the end of a movie free of love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris chews the scene. Captain Quent (Robert Shaw) was not this "jokey". Fortunately, most of them have been put into my mind, and when I ran through them on the television screens, I move immediately. "Danger, Is Robinson!" Watch the current TV ad showing a husband and wife watching whales ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it ended in sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life I will never go back to.
