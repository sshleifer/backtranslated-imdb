What a terrible film. The acting was bad, the playback speed was bad, the filming was bad, the output was bad, and the "special" effects were bad. Expect a certain degree of bad in the runaway, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the previous event that put the motive for the carnage lasted for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what had happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then, the victims were called to "reunion" in an abandoned school where all the facilities were still operating. One of the victims thought that was a bit strange, but they refused and decided to break into them anyway. > There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, not very good breasts in it. This film makes Showgirls almost indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
