This film features former football players Fred Williamson (Mac Derringer) and Gary Bossi (Lenny), who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of men and women with bad backgrounds. McCain was approached by his ex-wife, Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who engaged in sexual dialogue over the phone. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do terrible things to her and asks for help with many other ladies. Mac and Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Florida. Golf courses or you can sit in the Sports bar where all kinds of things are available in the city. There are a lot of punches, killings and a lot of double-meaning words that convey this movie to the big zero. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me just 50 cents and that was exaggerated.
