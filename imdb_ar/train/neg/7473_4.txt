My husband and I were intrigued by the scene - a strong southern woman with a chaotic personal life that solved the crimes committed in the Los Angeles police. The first season was the TV that you should watch for us. Unfortunately, her personal life stories in the second season have become too boring to fit into the strong personality we have stopped seeing. <br /> <br /> My husband and I have been disturbed by this episode where you try to hide it or the fact that it is restricted. But the deal was the episode where she conceals her potential pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why does a strong, middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is they will not do it. In addition, my husband and I meet the bad man with almost complete precision. It is always a white male or female being inserted into a hijab at the place of murder or in a perfect family. Can script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer performances that do not betray characters and insult our intelligence.
