Well, filming the "Indians" molded in this story is just a simple mistake. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the film. I was thinking, well, ... it was never really. It's the most obvious brown "Indian" make-up I've ever seen. It's as bad as "Indians" in "F-Troop" and Hollywood's old West, played by Jewish and Italian American actors, not real Native Americans! The story's songs and the medium literature, as in all subsequent Elvis films. He did them just because Colonel Parker made him tied up with long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money as possible from Elvis! I still think, thank God, that Elvis stopped making films forever and it was not long after this film appeared. It is wonderful to see representatives of the character Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones and Henry Jones and Bourgas Meredith in this film, <br /> <br /> The makeup of Meredith Bourgis 'Indian' is very cool. It is definitely the worst group. What did filmmakers think? Was Mr. Meredith doing this one just for money or what? I love some Elvis movies, though. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock" and "Viva Las Vegas". I can watch his film with Mary Tiller Moore and Ed Asner, "Changing Habits" in which Elvis plays a doctor in the city. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis has produced a few good films, but bad and bad movies have overtaken good and good movies. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you thank you very much!
