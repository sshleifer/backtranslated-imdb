Since this image is classified as "pure entertainment" and because there are already many comments on it, I would like to touch upon something related to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of Joker in this film. Certainly, as long as he took part in acting, he always acted as a small man - the actor could change his usual clothes but could hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter could be an advantage when necessary. No matter what I expected, I saw a very disguised picture, pretending to expose various aspects of a child's life by mistake to a forty-year-old criminal. And with a happy happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some of which are violence, sex, and criminal activities, including a very bad story and, to some extent, a lack of common sense: Where is Vanessa when she violates the peace of her home and her husband's life continues? In addition to the diamond is the world's No. 1 collinan! But the most disturbing aspect is the continued attempt to compensate the young man as a super man by showing his physical weaknesses. They call it humor. The diamond is precious, solid and brittle; it can not be cut by any other substance but is invoked only by the hot blood of a male goat. Thus no longer diamonds but pieces of debris.
