The film begins with a good start in Shannon Lee's interesting and powerful portrayal, and offers two very sympathetic side effects during the first half. But later something happens and all of Shannon's sudden turn into this straight girl, the bad girl used and the film in its own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad representation, terrible plot and even worst coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Death 2" was bad and Bruce, but his daughter tops her making her embarrass herself more than the double man Bruce Lee played at the time. I really think they can do much better, I hope to participate in the best production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the real hard movement and do not care about quality, keep watching this movie. I was looking for him personally but I was very disappointed.
