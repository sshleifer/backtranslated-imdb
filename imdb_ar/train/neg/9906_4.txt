After reading the reviews, it became clear that everyone thought about this work. How utterly boring. Oh what about the good ol days and there was something like that. Of all the comments, no one expressed any passion for this work or anything else. <br /> <br /> It grew up just after the end of the steam era, and this film jewel alongside Daniel Boone was characterized by accountability on Saturday afternoon. . This was an annual film making tours and filling the seats with playing, jogging, laughing and laughing monsters like me or I myself. He was stuffing the movie theater at the time. Almost the size of Wizard Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every critique contains something about the plot. The problem is that it was rather a mold. Here goes. Randolph Scott (Cowboy / Hero) gathers friends and goes defeats to these wicked people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> We all discovered the children of the plot before we dropped it by quarter to see it. This was just a plot line for each of Scott, John Wayne and Roy Rogers. If you take the time to go back and review every movie - do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> One must remember the context of the times. There was no television or a little of it. Nothing for kids. There was a school. There was great outdoor. There were toy guns. No cyber time. The steam era had just collapsed. But such films provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young robbers. So girls got it. <br /> <br /> This movie was entertainment. It is just as reckless as anything produced today. The purpose was originally from being a propaganda. But soon became children's films. <br /> <br /> Our parents have suffered from reality. This will not be the case even Sam Beckenba a decade later, which eventually gave rise to replicated red blood spots in abundant real quantities. No one died so slowly that he was subjected to severe pain and misery. Even the Beckenba war and the arms battles were a bloody affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a film that had little or no blood, the adults did not mind. They would not have tolerated that, I think. No courage sprinkle the lives of plant smashing. So this film had all the glory and not glory. Gung Ho was suitable for children then. <br /> <br /> You will see that I have allocated four for this category. Why did I do that? Okay. It is a terrible film. It does not matter how I like it. I loved this movie because it brought back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But not all that is good for a film in terms of quality. Basically, Go Gong is go to become a romantic novel for children. <br /> <br /> People should see it. Of course, of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. Shallow characters? They are shallow water. You can love a bad movie.
