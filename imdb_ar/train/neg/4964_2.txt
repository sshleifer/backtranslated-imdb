This movie is a farce! The names are blatantly wrong and the plot is filmed and classified into something unrecognizable by any literary lover. They have the bitterness to give Beowulf a ridiculous artillery weapon / clips. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, Grindel's arm ripped his bare hands! I can not believe that the script writers did something like that. The way of filming Grindel is impressive. This is the only positive point of this feature. The English teacher would have been mad if she saw this atrocity. Unless you are a fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this movie at any price. Until then, I would not recommend it.
