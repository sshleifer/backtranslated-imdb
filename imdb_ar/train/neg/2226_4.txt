DD movies were full of curse, stupid and curse and had a plot that looked thin but in those days it was a conspiracy at least <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy but a combination of melodrama and romance everything Each dramatic scene is blown disproportionately <br /> <br /> Comedy is funny but very popular. However, the film keeps you entertained, in those days Govinda's movies were high, and copper, but they were funny moments I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job. Music is fine <br /> <br /> Govinda behaves well in comedy and charisma drama respectable in parts and harasses in parts. Prem Shopra is a shakti typecast that is hilarious
