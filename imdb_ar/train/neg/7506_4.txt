Good actors and good performances can not disguise a meaningless mask, bad dialogue, and patterns of behavior that do not turn into something you care about. The most interesting character is David Berkovich. No personal development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering for no particular reason, they teach us nothing and do not even bother to entertain.
