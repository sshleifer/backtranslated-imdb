This film is a big yawn proving that Americans did not get a farce comment. Even when he has already written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is an ingenious comedy of 8/10 mistakes. It is not just a linguistic translation, but some absurd strings of events are completely skipped, stealing the film from its original smart comedic nature and turning it into a balanced style of "mocking my pleasure."
