Del - "You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin - "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in rewriting." <br /> <br /> I think the most I find awful about this bastard in Asimov's work is how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first powerful protagonists, able to think her way through a problem. She is just a girl in distress, waiting to be rescued by Will Smith. <br /> <br /> There are passing references to Asimov's Robotics laws, but they are an afterthought of CGI and motion scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is lovable, because in most of his movies, but honestly, the story is not good. You figure out a long time before these genius characters do.
