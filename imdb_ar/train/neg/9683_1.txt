I give this piece of trash 1 buzz simply because I do not think there is a worse film in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and I hate representation, dialogue, preparation, writing and directing. I hope everyone who participated in this movie will rot and rot in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Damn a waste of time is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Everyday I call this movie a piece of fiction. I pray that I dreamed the film, and I will never have to watch it in my local shop for video again. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
