I did not see the movie clip when I went to watch the movie, and instead, I relied on a friend's opinions. I really like Chris Rock and comedy, but this film is still flat on his face. <br /> <br /> During the film, Rock presents a few funny jokes, but unfortunately, the film lacks comedy. It seems that the film wants to merge both laughter and love into one, and this endeavor fails. The love story in the film is straight forward (fortunately), but it greatly detracts from the film by making Rock serious and gentle. After all, the film is first and foremost destined to be a comedy, where laughter must be the main concern. Not so much in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot is also not as interesting as a whole. Some parts were quite intermittent. If the aim of the cast is to be funny, they certainly did not do a good job. The couple of angels tried to make some jokes, which were dry and boring. The first couple of rock-making were also nice. If there was one thing they did correctly, they made Rock seem more entertaining compared to that.
