I have now seen this movie twice, and I must say I enjoyed it every time. Fast paced and fun, but ultimately ridiculous. After I said that it deserved to be broken by tension, which could be a good follow-up to the original origin. It is clear to those who have watched the horror film "Zombie Cribing Fleisch" that the films can be attributed to Bruno Matte's enormous shortcomings, and that the praiseworthy thing about him could be worthy of Folsi. This is not the idle state of Folsi, and the styles of the directors are starkly contrasted all the time, and you can tell who faces what, especially in the case of matte. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the outbreak of a virus (strangely referred to as a "big secret" by a scientist). It is clear that secrecy has become more remarkable than its potentially horrific impact on humanity (somewhere in the southeast) Asia. The virus causes behavior such as zombie in the infected, and the virus spreads rapidly in an apparently arbitrary land area. Our heroes are inadvertently wandering in the danger zone, and they must fight for their lives against the wounded Asian legions. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film is stuck midway between being a zombie and an outgrowth of the adventure of motion, and this confusion is captured more clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have a set of common characteristics for everyone. Some of them are mixing mix without the usual spirit, well presented in the original, and perhaps create a fulsi here. The other major group of those who have contracted the virus have lost all their feelings, but they have suffered from brutal aggression and the desire to win a black belt in Ninjutsu: Unconsciously jumps around uncertainty as to whether they will continue to strengthen their technology in the upper stage or engage with their brothers In what resembles a festival of collective tickling for their unfortunate victims. Martial arts skills are not only their talents, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, hiding in wooden rafters and under straw bales, sometimes falling inexplicably from nothing but the heavens themselves. This is definitely the work of Mattei. <br /> <br /> There is a third more coma group of zombies. It seems that this kind of thing also keeps the irony: "I'm really thirsty ... for your blood." The funny twist at the end when the DJ turns into a zombie but continues to preach the fate of humanity, only strengthens the WTF factor and blurs any hope for a serious solution. <br /> <br /> There is a notorious zombie head who slowly pushes himself through the air, a skeletal smile on his face, as if to say, "Yes, we know how bad this is." <br /> <br /> The characters are all exactly one dimensional as you expect. But the comic dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. After saying that the first soldier of death made an impressive brave display against the unstoppable zombie threat. In fact, this is the first and perhaps the only time we have encountered the real zombie, and one of the only effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The man who played the role of a great scientist has a heart, but has no talent, and takes advantage of the stop. In its lines quite randomly, so the sounding ends like a confused asthma. The scientists on the screen trying to find a completely unconvincing antidote "Now, let's put these two molecules together!" <br /> <br /> There are some moments that are still really effective. In an early scene the protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering the room, we encounter a mysterious view of a changing figure in the corner and a twisted mass on the ground, all released in light diffused into the atmosphere. The silence was interrupted by the appearance of a quick sickle that uses a coma that destroys everything in his back in his disturbing desperation to take her. Pure aggressiveness is one of the moments of real horror in the film. The idea is transferred before and after through the hotel that hosts the events in the first phase of the eruption, and later as a refuge to our heroes saturated with a thick moist atmosphere. There is a scene where one of the soldiers approaches cautiously from a confined room that clearly includes hordes of undead, and this is very tense. Things become more dramatic when they are in the hotel themselves unaware of what lies on the top floor. But this is handled in a slow and inefficient way as much as it could have been. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this film may be worth calling it the "Royal Screw" for a potential tropical coma festival, rather than just through and during a bad film. If there is nothing else, it contains a lot of unintentional laughter which I expect from anything Italian and the glory of the eighties.
