The Omega Code was a model of cinematic contrast. There was little (but little precious) good conduct, primarily by the Prophets and Rosenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise acting was definitely bad. The plotline was rather weak, and was based in part only on an already dubious interpretation of the book. Definitely not one of the best year.
