Thumb idea is not a winner in the second round. The ThumbTanic program was not as good as Thumb Wars for several reasons. In the first place, I think Mr. Odekirk had much less to work with in sending the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, Titanic has not yet become a cultural legend, and there are far fewer references to be made with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled with one-time jokes that do not really seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero hinted that the heroine was not clean during the "jump from the end" scene - it was not funny. Instead, you just think to yourself, "Did I miss something in the original film?". There was a lot of this kind of jokes that were unfounded (see the spider). <br /> <br /> By contrast, sending the designer of the smuggled ship made sense and was funny. It was also very funny to send a movie in a movie that wanted to go "faster" as madness revolves around everything * everything is "faster" including the ship sinking and it is the first to die. This type of jokes meant something in the context of the Titanic and added a quiet sense of humor to the thumb. <br /> <br /> The "media" of the thumbs, faces and sounds are still amusing. Props, collections and CG animations deserve appreciation. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that strangeness alone will not work, this little movie still keeps you very happy.
