I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my God !!! This was the worst film I've ever seen. Bad behavior, bad effects, bad script, all bad! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenage clich√©s on their way to rave (which occurs in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what had happened to the other party leaders, the clan embarked on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this Crusade, they are assisted by a police chick and a naval captain who have the right number of weapons each child can provide. They also meet with Jonathan Chery and some other survivors. Essentially, the rest of the film is a set of weak motion sequences including a very long shootout outside the "House of the Dead". This battle came complete with stunning Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and a rotten camera roll. One volunteer in the personal to sacrifice himself to save others. why? Not because he was noble and courageous, but because part of his face was injured by scars due to acid and a zombie spit on him after he continued to overcome the creature after a long period of disruption! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this man?!? <br /> <br /> To summarize everything, it's useless to see this movie unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater in which I was dead was more than zombie on the screen, and I'm sure that the money I lost in seeing this piece could easily cover the costs you ask for. Grade: F
