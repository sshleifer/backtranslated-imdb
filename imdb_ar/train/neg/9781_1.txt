I do not think I'm too far from al-Qaeda, saying this may be the worst film I have ever seen. I've been working on my favorite war films: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the Kwai River" (all black and white), all of which have good schemes and characters rich in great acting. I have seen better dialogue and representation in single plays written by students. The plot, but not a bad hypothesis - just implemented poorly. It's kind of a traffic accident, although I can not turn it off! The film does not need big money or great collections, like "The Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so do not count the budget as an excuse. As they were thinking?
