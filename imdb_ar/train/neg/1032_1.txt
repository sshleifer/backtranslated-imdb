Although I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo company (because of its terrible production values), it looks like Shakespeare compared to a pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Scrappy-Doo is undoubtedly the most disturbing and horrifying character created for children (this includes Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Who was the bright idea is to create a kind of short-haired dogs and enable them to speak and then saddle Scooby Doo characters out?! Who deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is the best). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply deceptive, annoying and grunting on the nerves - this is only the best loops! After many years, it was better to end the franchise rather than create this mess! I can see why they made Scooby-Doo the evil living Scrappy-Doo - because everyone actually hates it!
