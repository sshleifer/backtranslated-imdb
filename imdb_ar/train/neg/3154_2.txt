Look, there's nothing amazingly offensive about this film, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com game that you can see before you see it as much as you see it in the trailer. The main difference is that classic rom-coms treat their stories intelligently and lack a claim. This film has no claim but it has no sense of movement, you feel as if you can get up and walk at any moment. The production of the film also has a premiere feeling film made about fifteen years ago. I recommend re-watching a classic film like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow tradition. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael look nice like Vaughn's alias, you'll be very disappointed by the way they made him look out here.
