I was very excited and eager to watch this movie when boredom first appeared in November! Sounds fabulous and songs! I was very disappointed when I went to see it! This is a film that weaves 6 couples together. Have a multiple group of 12 people! Many stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, was not able to manage the situation well, and he was not supposed to have a lot of people in this film because that would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's first production, "Kal Ho Na Ho", Salam Ishak is lagging behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star. I think the best factors for this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are great, and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy has done an excellent job and done an excellent job over the years. I think ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with was that the director did not include nudity in this film by Suhail Khan and Isha Kubikar. I found this very shameless watching this with family! Although some may find this naked as a comedy, it is not something you want to see with parents! I think the best representation by Salman and Brianka in general, I think it's a good movie!
