Trashy B tries to disguise as a study of sexual addiction, but it is really a weak excuse for sexual dust. The story revolves around Sammy Horne (a pseudonym) played by Michael Des Bares. Sami is the owner of a restaurant with unknown wife Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a small child. He has sex addiction and must fuck senseless every five minutes with any woman in his vision who will agree (and of course every woman on this planet finds it irresistible despite the fact that it seems big enough to collect social security). <br /> <br /> The story focuses on a conversation with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski), where he describes each of his sexual exploits via the flashback. This is not the most appropriate starting point for reviewing serial sex acts, which consume at least 75% of the screen time. <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start criticizing a film so bad. Production values ​​are very poor. The film is filmed on video with a look somewhere between the television opera opera (at best) and amateur pornographic footage in someone's garage. The direction by Joseph Brutsman is terrible with poor lighting, uninspiring framing, and poor actor direction. The text is written in dialogue, and the dialogue is impulsive and vulgar. <br /> <br /> Women are generally portrayed as obsessed with sexism, just waiting for an addict like Sammy to take them and upset them while feeding their unscrupulous appetite with some non-personal intercourse. For example, Grace's sister comes to inform Sami in anger that she knows he is sleeping around her and that she will tell his wife. His answer to this is to throw it on the wall and start raping it. After about three seconds of it, she has an epiphany and is immediately transferred to one of his sex students asking him to give her more. Just as Grace walks up and says: "It's great to see you, you have to rush to pick up Timmy." Loyalty bonds have been sealed with good loot. There is no spoiler here because it is very typical of the clear nature of the film so that anyone who saw the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it. <br /> <br /> Sex photography is overrated, all mechanical, and poorly simulated they are more comic than erotic. Most are done with both participants fully dressed. Representation is miserable. Michael Des Barres offers the depth of the rain pool. It really seems that he has entered the courage and sex parts, but when it comes to actual behavior with Arquette and Kinski, he is unknowingly. Rosanna Arquette is the closest to the actor in this film, where she performs likely and looks really painful when she finally discovers that her ideal husband is a failed animal. Nastassja Kinski is very sympathetic with the therapist, but at least we have some acting going on here. The rest of the cast is just a group of high doubles in the body who give them thought-provoking lines like "Beat me harder, is that the best you can do?" And "Oh, God? Yes". <br /> <br /> This movie is among the worst I've ever seen, a suspicious distinction given the thousands of movies I've seen. I gave him a very rare shame in his 1/10 assessment. It can not be seen within three hours of any meal.
