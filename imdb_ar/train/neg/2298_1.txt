Here are some examples of Pat Robertson, who claimed to be a "relatively good record" of predictions <br /> <br /> In his widely reported comments on January 2 from a network of 700 Christian networks in which he predicted a " Very serious terrorist attacks "and" mass murder "in the United States in the second half of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted that he had a" relatively good record "in previous predictions. But a revision of Robertson's 2006 New Year's expectations undermines this claim. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will strengthen." The fall elections will be inconclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in power. " The war in Iraq will end successfully, and we will begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year. " WAY WRONG <br /> <br /> Moreover, according to an article published by the Associated Press on January 3, Robertson has a history of dubious predictions: <br /> <br /> In January 2004, President Bush will easily win the re-election. Bush won 51 percent of the vote, beating Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. False <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted Bush would win after winning his second term. Said social security reform proposals will be approved mistake again! <br /> <br /> He claims to be speaking directly with God ... If so, God has the sense of humor that he sees and is constantly deceiving himself.
