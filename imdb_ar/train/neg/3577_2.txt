The early Pia Zadora followed this familiar version of Harold Robbins: the ambitious main ambitions of the degenerate as it follows the path to the top of a randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But although it is so equivalent to the degree that it is perfectly predictable, this film runs at the same time it is totally unbelievable. Zadora (for her inexperienced call as an actress is to be charitable) is never persuaded as a screenwriter. One might expect a film about filmmaking to have some ideas about its industry and its creative process. But the script does not give her any of the qualities that make the characters interesting film characters: celebration, skill in words, and the relationship of hatred of love with the capabilities of the individual creative. Her character is empty like a donut hole. This is just the taste of incompetence presented here. Cinematography is so vague that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. The scenes are never intertwined, so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood concerts. Avoid.
