The Liddies Man is a funny film. There is not much thinking behind it, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were very funny. Chris Barnell was funny in his short scene (one of the most entertaining in the film). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and there is only to support Meadows. I've certainly seen more entertaining movies, but I've also seen stupid movies. Again, it is not a very deep film, but good for a few laughs. It was as entertaining as a comic play though. But still, if you are looking for a very funny film, I recommend this movie. Do not think too much, or hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
