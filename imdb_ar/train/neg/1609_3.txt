The first part, Chi in Cuba, revolves around this part of his life. It contains a lot of indistinguishable battles and Che fools many wounded who can not be distinguished (remember that Chi was a doctor). Ends when Castro wins the revolution. Chi did not arrive in Havana. The second part, Chi in Bolivia, revolves around guessing what. Contains a very large number of undetectable battles and Che cheating of many undefined wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized that this was supposed to be "Epic" (I did not know * anything * but the title before it started), I was naturally thinking of the greatest epic of them all, David Lawrence of the Peninsula Arabic. More later. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be racist, but apart from what you have already mentioned, there is the fact that there are many indisputable personalities - representatives of unknown Hispanic origin, who are looking for it. Both, especially given that they are all dressed in "Chi" beard and all dressed in chi. This results in the viewer's inability to identify with anyone other than Chi, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very simple role). While Del Toro is wonderful, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only character character: La Alec Guinness, Omar Sheriff, Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Because the other characters are interchangeable, this causes the reference to be lost. When senior chi assistants are killed, do not feel remorse because you do not know who they are. Even when the qi is killed (do not think this is a spoiler), there is no sympathy from the audience - I just killed. <br /> <br /> It is so monolithic that it can not be considered as a human being. Apart from being a revolutionary and secondly to Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we know about Chi is that he is married and has five children (he tells another character approaching the end). What was his motivation? Full Puzzle. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh may have been deliberately declining. Like Chi Soderberges, Lynn does not let us know anything about Lawrence, the mysterious man in Arabia. But at least Lawrence was a friend (Sheriff) and his colleagues (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was insecure - in the sense that he had human qualities. Che looks like a machine, like warmth like The Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year, there was another epic of war, the Mongols. Chi makes the Mongols look like a wonderful life.
