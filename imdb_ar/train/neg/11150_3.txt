I watched this movie alone, in the dark, the moon was full outside! I did not do it on purpose, it happened that way. So all the elements were present for this movie to scare the hell out of me !! Well, that was not the case, in fact I wanted to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought I'd give it a chance, unfortunately I did. The acting was awful and I was the only one with some decent representation of Armstrong Smayer. The plot is not original, if you are a horror lover, they are just the same things that I have seen several times before. Some scenes were not logical at all, and you just feel that the director wanted to make the film longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. The scenes (frightening) seemed to belong to a horror film from the 1980s when there was not enough technology, but some good films were produced at the time! I was surprised to see the name of one of the major production companies at the beginning of the film, I thought they could not put some money in it and make it fit? !! I can not agree more with the ratings obtained by the film; it is also my classification, 3 out of 10.
