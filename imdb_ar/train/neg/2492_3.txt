I think I've seen worse movies, so I give this number 3, but it's a struggle to remember what it could be !! Maybe Xtro (bad and boring) or maybe crawling (just plain boring), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say that he is a poor man under siege, starring Jean-Claude Van Dam as a poorer man. The only advantage of redeeming value was seeing Casper Van Dien - I was always wondering what happened to him after the spacecraft's forces. Yes, I've had Johnny Rico, if you really want to know him. <br /> <br /> Starting from this site, I was stuck in the hell of a TV movie .... Casper, Be More Selective .... Please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I've just delivered a decent half film on the called criminal code ...... Now I'm starting to feel really upset about the last 1.5hrs!
