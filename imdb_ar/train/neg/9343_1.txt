How do I begin by reviewing a film that will soon be known as "The Worst Film Ever" by "The Worst Director Ever?" A film can develop a dogma because "it's so bad it's good?" <br /> <br /> The analytical approach that criticizes the film seems meaningless and part of the cart syndrome - let's move freely without worrying about the reverse reaction because everyone else on Earth does it, and people who like the film like it Which we cited. <br /> <br /> The poor international quality of the film goes without saying - "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" is not without competition for the title of the worst film, so you should sink very low to get the title and keep it, but I think this The film can cut the distance. The IMDb program does not allow enough words to indicate the failure of all movies, and it would be much easier to locate the "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" correctly. Unfortunately, these moments of glory have been buried so far in the shadows of this film that is not worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was going through. I was warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this cup (I hope this is a vodka). Despite my low expectations, "sixteen years of alcohol" failed to entertain me even on the level of "irony of the bad film". Not only bad, but as bad as if Jobson deliberately tried to make this film a poetic appeal but went to the extreme limit and poured the hair down our throats, making it not deep but funny. .. Is it supposed that Jobson honestly tried to produce a good film? Even after watching the promotional literature "Sixteen Years of Alcohol", I find it hard to believe the truth of Jobson. Meaningless and obnoxious to the end with several moments of smiling / chuckling (all I'm sure is not intentional) broadcast the movie, these few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. Too bad it's good? No. I've only had enough "I can not believe that these are serious movie moments" to stop me from turning it off, nothing more. <br /> <br /> Surely a movie to watch with a bunch of bad film film experts. Get your ongoing comment. That would greatly improve the experience for me. Very bad, Mike Myers has commented on the Scottish cod accent on it while running, to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce "Ok man, pass me a gleam of whiskey dat."
