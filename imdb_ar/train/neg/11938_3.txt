The film started well enough. He had a colleague who was hit by a glowing green meteorite, got super powers (mental mobility, x-ray vision, immunity, flying, ability to talk to dogs, speeding, thermal vision, ability to make plants grow large and fast), and fighting crime. From there, everything became on a slope. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a costume from his mother, wrestles with the resident gangs, and encounters many abortive encounters with gang leaders that prepare you for the disappointing long disappointment. , Ending with a stunning end. <br /> <br /> It will not be too bad if you do not want to watch a boxing match in which the fighters pretend to beat each other while the audience stands ahead while the only fighters continue to dance. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the movie has good points. It clearly states that if you try to confront a gang alone, they will return to your home and abuse you. It states that gangs and communities need to see their true enemies (the great bosses who use them to achieve their own purposes to crush honorable people in the presence of a Jewish neighborhood). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to act as a community that destroys predatory animals that harm them. The only message it really lacks is that voters must make sure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George W. Bush) are not also crooks. <br /> <br />
