The small minority we see here praises this film. I know it's up to people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than two brain cells can definitely see that this is total nonsense. Too bad I do not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how wonderful friends are with someone who is involved in the film are trying to give their career a boost. Poor in everything, do not fool people by saying otherwise. Story is a weak rework of the previous entries, script is also. Attempts to hide the lack of authenticity using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not hide the lack of ideas among filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of any concerns. Certainly there are no substitution qualities, absolute feces. I have given this pair of mark one mark just because he had nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap. They must have done more in this than they did in the film industry. Shame.
