The cinematic picture, probably, was in 1930 and was released in 1931. I suspect that talking about moving pictures has had great difficulty in moving from the silent era. However, this Zane Gray plot seems very weak. Also, Gary Cooper probably was just learning to act. The result is unacceptable by today's standards. Of 1931, perhaps. For 2004, is unacceptable. Some actors perform well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end in the early West. They lived on the ground long before the arrival of the white man, but according to twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
