Usually, I'm a generous critic, but in the case of this film, I must say it was so bad. I am amazed at how positive most of the reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some wonderful shots, but it was very bad that they were lost in this swamp of the movie. Maybe it was successful if the "daggers" flicked off the act and not romantic, but unfortunately, the film centered around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the spouses, and it seems that all that exists between Mai and her men is more lust than love, and often the dialogue is ridiculous. This may be just a translation problem, but the repeated use of the word "flirt" reminded me in particular of the eighth grade, not forever, together forever, worthy of death in exchange for love; I also felt that we had been beaten on the head by borrowing the wind. The audience is given very little about the characters they really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I was hoping for a remote control to move forward, I was graded in my seat ready to snore, but I was often very surprised. <br /> <br /> ******* ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, ice on the cake. Or rather, add insult to injury. The finish was really one of the most horrible flavors I've ever seen. The boys fight the deer and yell and yell and pierce each other. Oh, and then the snow begins. randomly. Oh, then Mi (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly emerges from the weeds. Then the lunge is designed it seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination, so it slows down comfortably in the middle of the screen to reach a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, Mai finally dies because she threw the dagger that was deposited in her chest and bleed to death. Jane sings, sighs, holding her body up close, the screen blank. I, the people who surround me, are laughing. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but eventually fails.
