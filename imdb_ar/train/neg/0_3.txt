The story of a man has abnormal feelings for the pig. It starts with the opening scene and is a wonderful example of ridiculous comedy. The audience of the official orchestra becomes a violent mob through the crazy chants of its singers. Unfortunately, this time remains absurd without a general narrative that eventually makes it elusive. Even those of the epoch must be stopped. Invisible dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy in the third row. On a technical level, this is better than you might imagine with some good cinematic work presented by your great future, Filmos Zigmond. The future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederick Forest can be seen briefly.
