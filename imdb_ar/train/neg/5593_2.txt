I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember from other Dracula movies when I was younger and I thought it was wonderful, but this movie was so bad. I do not know if it was my youth who tricked me into believing that I was the final Dracula, with elegance, appearance, gravity and evil beneath him. Or maybe it was the film that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a simple English accent and a body language that agrees with her? Do you like when the plot contains unrealistic options for characters and dull and lacking any kind of tension ..? Then this movie you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - do not see it! I only gave it number 2 because somehow I managed to stay awake throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you like this movie, you should be sleep deprived while you are at home alone in a dark room with lots of unattended space behind you. Perhaps alone in your parents' house or in the home of strangers. The characters in this click do not seem to look scared, and I think it sums up everything! <br /> <br /> Or you might like this movie because of its place in Dracula's film history, and you may be fascinated by how Dracula's story has evolved from Naserato to what it is today. Because the film is not attractive, it does not draw you to the inspired mystery that makes the myth of Vampyre very fascinating. <br /> <br /> Moreover, there is much of that feeling that is delightful in the 1970s. The scenery looks like a cheap theater. I am not saying that everything was rejected in the 1970s. Because I can love the old film as well as the new.
