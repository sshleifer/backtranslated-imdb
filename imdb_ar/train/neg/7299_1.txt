I have certainly seen bad films in my life, but this film was so bad that I became really angry at the theater. I wanted to restore my money. I wrote to the director asking him to retrieve my movie ticket, of course I did not receive a response (or even a response) but that's the point. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a -42. Why did Chevy Blazer stop jogging by beating the bat? Why hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with bats in the first place instead of cracking bum skull? The plot was thin, and the film was full of clear cliches, and certain parts of it were illogical.
