Abysmal with capital "A". This must be one, if not the, program that is not on the TV now. I'm about to fight the bush, but this offer does not come out of a chuckle. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you like this strange show. "Jokes" is not funny at all. For example, in a scene where the lil bush wears his underwear on his head: "Welcome to the base camp!". There is nothing funny about it. Is it supposed to be a joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks before the show, and its humor, were more entertaining than the show itself, which is sad. Hopefully not even considering this second season. It should not be so first.
