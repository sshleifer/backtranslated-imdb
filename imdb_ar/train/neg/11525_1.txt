Simply awful! Why not use the actual actors? Look, this must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent through these low budget movies ... please in order to love God, use real actors! Most will work for free ... make use of it! Now back to my comment ... Anyway, humor was less than the bathroom set and was not funny at any level. As for the quality ... In one scene filmed on a public transport bus, you can see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? It was one person who looked like Sony's video camera, and maybe not. Well, I suppose the only audience in this film are people with a gore. It was not good.
