I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a new version of Noir's 1949 film, Chris Cross. I found that the latter was disappointing but it was better than this film. <br /> <br /> This film is a "new light" because in modern times and color, two things would make them fundamentalists ineligible for the status of the movie Noir. <br /> <br /> However, the cinematic (which was fine) was not the biggest negative, but the story was mixed. Hey, some Daschle Hammett stories from the 1940s were similar but I did not care about each other. The directors here did not help the situation by putting the memories of the past in the story seemingly every three minutes. No wonder he was keeping up with this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that within 45 minutes, a lot of confusion has become irrelevant to anyone. I know I did not.
