I was afraid to take my nephews to this film, so I did not think it would be good. The children, aged between 6 and 10, wanted to see him, so she gave in. I must admit it was not as bad as I thought, but it was far from the book. The film looked right with an understanding and sense of humor at the age of 10 years. I found that the 6 year old child understands what is going on and that he provides solutions to the issues that occur. I finally had to explain that sometimes movies do not offer the best solutions to problems because it's fun to see what happens if the choices are "silly" or "stupid."
