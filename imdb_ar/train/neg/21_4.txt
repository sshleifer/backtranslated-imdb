What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film did not have a screenplay to test any actors acting in skill or ability. I have demanded next to nothing I bought this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this was another failure. The script was so bad. They had nothing to drown in. All the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the script and direction did not allow him to even do enough of his character to make him more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the shooting sounded like the sound of paintball guns when they were fired into a skirmish. He was really strange and did not look like real guns. The video game was better sound effects than this movie. There was also a really disturbing tone at the beginning of the film which was a member of the robbery ring. He had this American selfish voice as a girl shouting lines like "Let's get out F # $ k from here and what we're going to do." He looked like a girl, I laugh too, for a few seconds, he's a stupid movie. .
