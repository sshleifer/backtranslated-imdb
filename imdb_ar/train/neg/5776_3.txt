Bad representation, bad southern dialects, asymmetrical cinematography, and terrible scenario ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and I was very disappointed after seeing it. It contains a talent name quote / unquote, but it does not provide. Of course the basis for this is the uneven and interesting story that is told. <br /> <br /> Do not bother
