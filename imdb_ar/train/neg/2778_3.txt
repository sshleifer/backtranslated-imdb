It seems that this film will achieve all this thanks to good camera, sound, movies, collections, music and fashion ... but Gary Stretch! I do not know if this is his bad behavior or is it just a bad scenario, but I say it was both. Considering his molding in this role, I found it difficult to root it to the finish. I wish he had died in battle or in a sword / knife fight. <br /> <br /> Then, the plot was plotting to kill the King because the King did not have dinner and sex with his counterpart. the Queen? Pretty lame. And go to the extreme to kill her son? And then pay her lover as a successor to the king? I see one or two lines here and there from historical bytes, but the way they were all presented was comic. <br /> <br /> I do not know Gary Stretch from anything else, but it was awful. I read the comments of another user about the sound called "Mdbalij", but do not think that Mdbalij was added to him ... After all, he speaks English, right? It was really awful. The lines were read directly from the forensic table ... flat line. He may not have had a voice that carries color swings. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I've seen it to the very end, so the film had at least "interest." It could have been more if given script / lines and poured more work. The crew scene and shooting with a very good film is what made this film really above all. Both had a cast and a secondary story. I gave the film crew 10.
