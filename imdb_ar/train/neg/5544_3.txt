While this film certainly smells bad film, it can be seen amazingly on several levels. First, for old film lovers, it is interesting to see the lead role played by Dean Jagger (unrelated to Mike). While Jagger later played a very respectable role as a supporting actor (he even won the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance here is truly unique because he already has a full hair head (I've never seen him that way before) By far the worst actor in the film. This film only shows that if the actor can not act in his previous films, it does not mean he will not eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (CHILVER CHALICE) is one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to watch the movie is to cut it. All. Bad writing, bad representation and bad special effects. For example, when Jagger and Cambodian sail unnamed in the water, they obviously walk in their proper place, and the background behind them is bad. In addition, once they leave the water, their fashion becomes 100% dry !!! The continuity of horror and the irrational dialogue spread throughout the film - so much so that it is hard to imagine why they did not ask Bella Lugusi or George Zuko to star in the film - because they both starred in many first-rate horror films. In many ways, this will be an ideal example of a film about how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> So, while giving it 3 may be a little over generous, it's fun to laugh and short so it's worth looking for bad movie lovers.
