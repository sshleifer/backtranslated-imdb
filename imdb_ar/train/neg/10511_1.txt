Note to Horror Lovers: The only horror here is when you realize that you've wasted 95 minutes of your life in a worthless movie, it's an insult. <br /> <br /> I saw this because: <br /> <br /> The hypothesis looks a little promising: it is not. It's just an excuse to use a lame set of other low budget movies that were not too good. <br /> <br /> The promise of barefoot nymphs seems nice even if the film turns out to be terrible: it is not. It's not. Amateur filmmakers make sure that the Fallen Angels are as exciting as the homeless person. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in this type of horror: it is the king of special low-budget special effects. And less budget representation. Come to think of it, Savigny should have reason not to watch this movie. It's not bad, but it's always bad movies. His only good role was in the movie "From Dusk to Dawn", and he has been milking it in horror conferences ever since. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on positive things: The Damned Forest is a wonderful example of how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. It is clear that the writer suffers from sensitivity to authenticity. The scenario is terrible. This is all given after the first 10 minutes. But the speed is ignorant. The way in which the director deals with the "plot" and "characterization" is a nuisance that no one thinks anyway; the sequence of driving, walking, and tedious nature by nature (no doubt added to increase running time to make the film eligible for distribution) To prepare for film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number one way you can tell if a movie will become bad: if it is written and directed by the same person, wait for the trash.
