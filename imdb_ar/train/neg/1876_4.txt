This is a low budget spoof for this type of spyware. To help frame your expectations, you should know the following: (1) representation is very strong. The stars enjoy great pleasure in presenting their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and out-of-key setup. (2) the script intentionally lacks continuity and reasonableness. The lines are often tense and humorously because they have nothing to do with the elements of the previous plot. (3) Snapshots are often framed in unbalanced angles, making use of gender transgressions. (4) Geoff Gold-Bloom presents a complex and ancient dialogue in a classic style. <br /> <br /> The film contains a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a stolen plot element from B films of the 1930s: a secret symbol in a structure that defies Carl Sagan's interpretation. The most representative film is used for the comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early gaffe, Ned Fei Grim, Ned Faye Grimm, is asked to leave frequently, so you can not help laughing while you feel sorry for the boy. The well-designed Parker Posey bedside also helps to set the tone of humor in the early part of the film. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not reinforce comedies or drama elements that emerged later. The film's impact as the drama is greatly reduced by early comedy. Moreover, it is difficult to overly share characters and their destinies when the first parts of the film are very sarcastic. The result was a deliberate heavy musical, and I found that this (and the non-repressed camera angles) was more disturbing than humorous. <br /> <br /> The plot is super-representation, the plot is unreasonable and almost incomprehensible. / Counter plots, slow grinding speed on many viewers. The film is too long in 158 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, fans who accept the irony of the film may want to see it again ... using an annotation to capture the clever irony of dialogue. The film was too slow for me and I was ridiculed more harshly than her light heart. But comedy may appeal to your taste. The film is worth watching for those who enjoy independent films, the likes of Hal Harley, or the worshipers of Parker Bossi (who has the greatest time for the camera).
