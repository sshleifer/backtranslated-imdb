This film lacked something I could not put it at first: charisma by the leading actress. This inevitably translates into a lack of chemistry when she shares the screen with her leading man. Even the romantic scenes she encountered were just actors in the play. It would have been possible for the manager to have misjudged what the actors needed. I do not know. <br /> <br /> But would it have been a scenario? Exactly exactly who was the chef in love? He seemed more passionate about his culinary skills and his restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his young exploits, than anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this film. But do not forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge yourself.
