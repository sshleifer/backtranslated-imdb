I rented this movie last week. Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so he looked promising. That was, until Justin Timberlake came on the scene. He is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to make a film again. I mean, he is one of the most boring and uninspiring actors I have ever seen. It does not put any emotion at all in any of its lines. Why the hell is the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon was a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His personality is very boring, it seems a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound great, but believe me, that's not right. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott is acting very well. It's about one of the few good things about this film. It is just a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. It has some really wonderful fonts. <br /> <br /> About the story, although it was a little obvious and sometimes overpriced it was good. I was expecting a great development when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
