Much worse than the original. In fact, it was painful to sit down, and he barely commented on my six-year-old interests. <br /> <br /> Introducing some new Pokemon is marginally interesting, but the story is very thin, the dialogue is still bad, and the music is mediocre. Watch the TV show instead - it's much better.
