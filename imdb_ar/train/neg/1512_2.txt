A nasty annoying attempt on "Seven", complete with second-rate acting, awful camera work, a half-baked story and a strong taste of lame propaganda. Yes, they are "sex offenders" and live in the neighborhood and you will be raped, indeed. <br /> <br /> No surprises from a female termist, acting as she always is - convincingly like a piece of wood. Richard Gear continues to slide down and down - a low here almost like the late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The crazy-eyed singer is the best when she dies in bed; even the wolf was substandard (although it was the best performance in the film) - they may have fed it before the shots, or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike the "Seven", which was his (making) interesting story, but interesting, which one can relate more or less regardless of the country, it seems that this film focuses on the US obsession only . If a person does not care much about "sex offenders" - statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death - there is no good reason to see him, or fear. <br /> <br /> There are some body parts and some snuff, but the stability is below average, and fails as a technical device (because it is useless) and as a body, because it is not harsh enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time in this.
