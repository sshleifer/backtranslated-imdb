This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's good to laugh at it. The dialogue can become incredibly funny and ill-disposed (eg, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any fighting is somewhat surreal. Be sure to watch Brock, the brilliant white man who attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best players in the film!
