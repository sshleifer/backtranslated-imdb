There was some truth to this film. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago that four fishermen found a body in the water and chose not to report it until their journey was over. I also recall that they were assigned to intervene in the body (or some of this charge). I'm not sure if that is in Australia. Viewers outside Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killers. Wolf Creek This film encourages this perception. The film reminded me of a simple plan. But as far as I'm one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can not be a vine. In words like this, I will not bother watching them again.
