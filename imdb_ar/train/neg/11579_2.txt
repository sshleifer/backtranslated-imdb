I must admit, I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there is one person, but I was so angry at this film that I had a hard time focusing on it. How can you name "Keys to Tulsa" and then shoot in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington (I think this is the location) does not resemble in any way the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa will have a much nicer life to live in. It is clear that no one in the film at all Tulsa or others would have realized how nothing in the film resembled him. Did anyone see at least Rumblefish or strangers? I know this sounds picky but I can not help it. I have seen this because I love James Spider and I usually find Eric Stutz interesting. But even these curious actors could not give life to this slant, meaning the story of self-interested people who are not in Tula !! I'm sorry, it can not be more expensive to shoot in Oklahoma. What if shooting "Life and Death in Los Angeles" was shot in Toronto? Do you suck? Well do this.
