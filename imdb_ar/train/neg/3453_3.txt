It seems that more attention has gone to IMDb reviews for this film than to look at the source. <br /> <br /> Here's a review without excuses: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing will end, it will not happen. <br /> <br /> Wear your clothes the way you want it, it's a boring film, full of unprofitable characters that matter very little attention. <br /> <br /> It is best to put it if you want to impress an impressive emo chick that you love, a deep man, <br /> <br /> There is nothing to watch for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless. You are. <br /> <br /> The buzz.
