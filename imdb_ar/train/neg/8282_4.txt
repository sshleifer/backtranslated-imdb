Now you must already know about this film, "Jessica Simpson" that went pretty much directly to the video (range, play limited anemia). Basically, Ms. Simpson Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, just to find him in bed with another woman. I have been stranded, but have one friend (Rachel Lee Cook, which I wish to see more in the film), which allows her to stay. Kitty ends up getting a job through two co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and Andy Dick are always amused) who use Katie to just drop the company head (Larry Miller). This film is strictly B, not intended to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty beautiful and never bothers her. The film is viewable in that it is not an abomination, but an elusive flutter. In a hijab, a funny Penny Marshall (a hidden joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian pastors (do not read much in this). So, not terrible, but easy to skip. Your safe bet is watching it on TV if it happens. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
