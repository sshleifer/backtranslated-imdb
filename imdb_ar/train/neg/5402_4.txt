This film is very incredible. - The whole hypothesis is bunkum. The fact that serial killer (vampire or otherwise) can fly around without killing and killing as many people as the film suggests is laughable. The vampire himself will not be seen from the place in the film Bela Lugosi. Most wooden representation is very, representatives must deal with dry mold. I am waiting for the day when someone will make a fit film from Stephen King's (except, perhaps, for my part) story. This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do - the lack of funds used for "special" effects, poor actors, horrific characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, tacky and fails at everything trying to do.
