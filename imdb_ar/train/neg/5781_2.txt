Roman Polanski made many extraordinary films. His fame disturbs me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I have not seen "knife in the water" or "tess"). A contribution made in the film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's Baby must have pointed to the end of the institution at the time it came out. It's a fairly high-end product of "Horror" in 1968 (the child never appears). But this is just a misunderstanding of horror. Everything seems to be so that the Earth's line becomes very hopelessly early (Um, thank you for this devastating title to the final), and on a clear day you can see the finishing touches ending for days. Did not keep my interest. I find that whatever the film was, it was completely derailed in the 1960s version of what femininity was. Farrow is such an illusory / helpless housewife. Its fragility is oversold ... it is very troublesome. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing should be taken into account except that you are the mother of Satan. <br /> <br /> Dakota is hardly used because it has a strange potential.
