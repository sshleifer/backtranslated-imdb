This film was somewhat disappointing. After a very slow start, the film begins to lose. Plenty of plots left little time for interpretation, and out of the theater I wondered what all this was about. The characters are still shallow, and the story is not convincing at all, most of which is a deja v without a hint of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts ... Like, the young policeman must dig a body. Of course it is night and rain and must do it alone ... yawn! Or the manifestation of evil being "Nazi" in addition to "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, this is really original. There are some nice shots, such as the first battle scene, mountain views and some gags (ongoing), but (although Renault and Vincent Castell are doing what they can), this is definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
