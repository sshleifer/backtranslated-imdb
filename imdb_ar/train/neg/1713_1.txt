If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you will not see. A contest like "Make Your Own Horror Movie in a Day" can not come as an introduction to this anger of insulting the intelligence of any viewer. Mr. Gates has forgotten a story, a plot, an appropriate dialogue, and the fact that people need some BASIC acting talent, and obviously the acclaimed lighting designer forgot to appear. It seems to have been recorded on the finest types of hand games, and copied on the worst machines. The make-up effect is made up of black mascara that is poured into the zombie and yogurt on people's heads to simulate melting of the skin. This is nothing more than a home movie, a very bad film too. Just fun to watch for friends, family members and neighbors who were willing to attend to the camera. For the rest of my life I can not understand why this mockery of a product is listed in any magazine or serious movie site - I have home movies for weddings that are better and more interesting. A complete waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is more than just waste.
