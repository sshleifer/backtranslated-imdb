Seriously, why do American and Fritz representatives who pretend to be Czechs need to speak English perfectly in a fake Russian accent? I am a man, so I enjoyed the unjustified nudity - but the soft flick would be more than that, and at least I would not pretend to be a technician. <br /> <br /> All of the political data is painfully educational - did the director hear about tenderness? The acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic sacrifices were never funny. The characters were very shallow, and I could not recognize them at all. <br /> <br /> The thing she laughed at was cutting the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in Prague - they were black and white and then dark brown to match the bare shots. <br /> <br /> I read many stories of short Kundera (not lightness of existence is not possible), there are good things about his style of writing (although his subjects are one of the great fantasy male), I must say, the film did not convey any From the good of the Kunderas style.
