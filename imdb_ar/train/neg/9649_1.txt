Who were joking with this? There was a lot in this film that was hard to digest. From the right when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) wishes to accidentally die for his father when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Um Puri) to abandon him in minutes. The only problem in this theory is that anyone who has passed through London Heathrow knows that such a platoon would be impossible to pull especially Indian. But the film's problems do not end there. There is a problem that two main actors (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) as rock stars are about to realize their dreams. I mean yes we saw success coming to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK realizing her dreams after the age of 50), but this was a rare case. It was really hard to comment on my non-ratification because I felt that casting Salman and Ajay was just a misconception. They will never turn to Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles. Why should we watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (good men in their forties) about a desperate attempt to cling to their time? Let's not even talk about the most conscious actress on the screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I have seen) and she is hopeless as an actress, so she is aware of her looks that she only cares about her good looks and wraps around the camera rather than performing well in acting. It's hard to believe that she refused all the roles of other films to star in this fluff and then become thin as an actress, nothing you write about at home at all. In addition, the film continued to be boring. There's nothing special about it at all, I was sure you expected everything clich√© to happen in it.
