I really wish that when making comedy, people actually tried making it funny. This is a movie you can watch, but there is nothing special about it. After watching it, you'll say it's fine. It was not boring to see him, but he did not give the audience any jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you are already getting something more than a story approval. This movie was intended to be "Tootsie", but failed instead. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10.
