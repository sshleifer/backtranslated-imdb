I got this movie because I worked at a movie store, so I got free rents. Came, and the casing made it look just fine. A hot chick, carrying a weapon, well, I'll check it out. <br /> <br /> Hey man, bad step. This was very awful, I spent half the movie in a quick watch to reach nudity, which is minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheerful dialogue, crappy violence, bad excuses for characters. I feel bad putting this film down, because I know it was produced with a cheap budget, but so was the "Clerks" and became classics of worship and excellent. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
