This film was amazing. It is beyond brutality. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movies store to find awful movies to watch their comedies worth. My friend suggested this, but as we saw, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, so I can say that I have, but I could not. It's so bad. Run the terrible gags, lame representation. The main characters are the annoying dinosaur Klaus and Wobi Goldberg. Best watch Costener's The Postman Twelve times in a row watching a small part of this movie again. I think they're trying to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the film that really stands out is that the dinosaur is constantly knocking things on its tail, and then gets upset about it. This painful. Watch it if you're an ambitious masochist, otherwise, leave this lonely.
