My wife and I are comfortable with the Mandel Fan program. I love Chattner - even when he is at its most pathetic. <br /> <br /> But this is the worst show on TV. br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter in this show and they seem to wear less clothing than Deal or without a deal ... <br /> <br /> Questions are a mix of the very easy way And incredibly vague. Watching Chatner or the rider say "Show me money" makes me want to vomit .. <br /> <br /> This will not last.
