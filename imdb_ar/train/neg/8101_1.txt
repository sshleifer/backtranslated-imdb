It is often said that films can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, the film is not only "good" like the book, it is an insult to the book. It is best to see the Milan Kundera, which caught fire instead of being "something", which the director might call adaptation. <br /> <br /> The whole beautiful philosophy that asks, "Is it better to carry a heavy burden on your shoulders, or to deal with an intolerable lightness of existence?" is set aside. Instead, all the films are the adventures of Daniel Day Louis (I can not say Thomas) with his stupid wife and mistress and his other mistresses. Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said: bad directors make bad films. Do not waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it really is worth it.
