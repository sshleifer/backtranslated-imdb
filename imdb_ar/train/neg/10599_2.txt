** Be the spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The government has continued to develop UniversalSoldier, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and more capable than ever before. However, the government is shrinking its size, the endangered project and the giant computer, which is in the middle of it, feels threatened, so it is taking steps to ensure its safety. He activates and controls the UniSols and starts to run the mess. The only person who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around one thing. The fighting was designed. The story is bad, and quickly sank into all the battles. Everything that happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this film, it is not fun to watch the fighting as you know part of it is indestructible. Usually be sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the battles between the two fighters are fairly equal. There is no place in it that is indestructible and can not be lost. Then the battles become just a tool to extend the time. Wait until the final battle when Deveraux finds a miraculous way to beat his unbeaten opponents. To further reduce my opinion, there is a desperate and confirmed sign of a bad film - the number of women in tight clothes. Well, there are not many of them, because the characters are most men (there is at least one woman UniSol), but almost every woman appears unnecessarily with at least one bra. The female progresses, but we also pass through a strip club (to use a computer at least) with more tariff women. These moments do not give anything to the story, there are only to try to please the public male adolescents. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, the battles are boring. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
