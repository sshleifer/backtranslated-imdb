A group of children set up a theater to get a horror movie marathon all night long. However, as night passes, there is one of them killing them one by one. Who is he and why? I saw it in a playful way in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boy! It does not work at all. Hypothesis is a good idea, and has a very attractive young crew and some professional like Wallace De Wallace on board ... but it does not work. The story stops thinking midway (maybe because of some massive edits before the movie was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how I got an R rating outside of me) and the killer was finally boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really very bad - this movie has a possibility. With a better script this could be a great horror film. He also seems to be mostly forgotten and the team itself seems to be embarrassed by it (I heard that Stone would not talk about this). I give it only 3 to the representatives.
