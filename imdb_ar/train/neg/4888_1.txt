Nick Millard nicknamed Nick Phillips should have been left alone enough when he made a "criminal frenzy" 10 years before the release of this God-awful loss of time and effort. The fact that the original "criminal madness" was less than an hour long should have been explained in the fact that he might have incited this story because he would have gotten out of it ... but instead he chooses to use TONS footage of the original in this one as well, Even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, Priscilla Alden did not restore rapid aging saving this. What a few of the original footage that appeared in this click as if shot with a handheld video camera! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be just as surprised if he achieved something close to that amount! Avoid this one and watch the original text instead!
