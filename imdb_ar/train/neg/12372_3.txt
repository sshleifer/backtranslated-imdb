I had high expectations for this film (the title, the translator, is "how to get rid of others"). After all, this concept is wonderful: a near future in which the ruling elite has been the result of the continuous verbal and legislative persecution by the right-wing government of the so-called self-employed and left-wing in general, and decided to kill all who can not prove they are contributing anything to the institution General, "but in reality means the interests of ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> A very wonderful idea! Perfect biting spelling! Only, this movie blows his chance completely. The spelling only comes out in a few scenes and the performance is absurd, but this spelling is unsustainable; it is neither sharp nor ingenious. For the alleged comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. I assume that comedy is supposed to be in the absurdity of attitudes, but the positions are very uncomfortable and excessive in danger, rather than provoking laughter or thinking. <br /> <br /> The text is very dangerous for errors in acting. The procedure should have focused on the political aspects and the extent of the error in doing something like this, but instead the slogans of time dictate a young woman who wrote the new laws for pleasure and who tries to save everyone. By organizing resistance that ships people to Africa. All this next to the point! A movie like this should not claim to be too serious! It's spelling! Political statement. But it does not even begin to address the problem it is supposed to be. Maybe he was afraid to go away? How cowardly. This is not art. It's not just a real satire. <br /> <br /> Soren Bellemark, who is very dangerous and is now a senior representative in Denmark, was very good. It has largely carried the value of the few entertainment in the film. Everyone: There is nothing distinctive (well, except maybe Lene Poulsen, who performed a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with most Danish films is that the language does not look normal at all. No formulation nor delivery. Why is it difficult to make it true? Why should it be simplified and artificial? I hope, when people look at these films 50 years from now, they do not think this is the way people in Danish society do. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
