The best shorts of Laurel and Hardy are filled to the teeth by accidents, accidents and destruction, often caused by Stan, but with the biggest penalty (see the Great Music Box (1933) or "Put in a Pit" (1932) Classic. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a drawing done by Stan's father?) The boys play it "directly in a" comedy "based on jokes and supposedly ridiculous positions. Do not pay off. It's just another 3rd-class boring third-class comedy, which is only augmented by Stan and Ollie characters who never show any of their brand-name gestures (a jiggle of a finger or an empty Stan star, etc.) or comic abilities . <br /> <br /> The movie starts with them running from the police. Because we do not see or know why, it is difficult to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and therefore hide in the palace of Colonel Bakshout. The "humor" hypothesis, Oiles, who passes himself like Colonel Wester who passes himself because both the servants and the maid are never busy. They are not playing "Stan and Ollie" in this film. It was possible to play parts by any of the representatives of the pedestrian studio and it would be equally poor. <br /> <br /> Stan could have swayed and made everything he did funny, but he had no chance of doing any of this here. He is constrained by a lot of dialogue to "move" the plot, but none of it rises much from the absurd. We have been dealing with endless third-class comedy chestnuts, such as the runaway gale that does not properly proclaim Lord Plumetree's name, "Call me a taxi! Well you're a taxi!" Jokes, cops lose their clothes and look at them in Young Jones, and the unbroken end of Stan and Ulus as the two parts in a painfully painful horse while fleeing on a bicycle for two people, and James Finlison is still doing his whole body grabbing on the Silent Era and levers on the Keystone Kop jump. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work better in the Comedy of Positions in 'Sons of the Desert' (1933) where we see them doing what we do love them - to be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seems to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this movie does not meet any of their strengths, why do you care about it? I have to give it 3.
