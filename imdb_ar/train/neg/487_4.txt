What did the director think? Everyone who read Artemisia's biography was influenced by her courage to face a public rape trial in the Renaissance and even tortured to show that Tassi was guilty. This reality shows true independence and liberation - in its most horrific hours, standing on its man. Why should the films depicting the Renaissance be so beautiful and romantic? Are we afraid to see the exciting side of life or win the happy mood in Hollywood? Although I have always defended the filmmaker's freedom in making his own reality in a film, I can not understand the transformation of Artimisia's life story on her head. A very disappointing choice by the makers of this film.
