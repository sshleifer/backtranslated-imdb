Shame shame shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was terrified. <br /> <br /> Do not take children to watch this movie. Humor is not quite suitable for children - plus they will feel bored and frustrated. Definitely * all of us * we read Theo's wonderful book for kids and definitely our expectations ... but this is a net garbage. Dr. Suss will feel ashamed and certainly never showed his "thumb" in this treacherous attempt to take advantage of the classics. <br /> <br /> Oh, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you have a copy, buy and donate the book to Toys for Tots. This movie is not worth watching "free" tickets. <br /> <br /> Continue the book. The TV version works well if you want a visual image - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on cable by St Pattie Day. <br /> <br /> A shame on what they do !!
