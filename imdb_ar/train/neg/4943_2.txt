I've seen three episodes of the cave man, and I have no idea why I'm going to stay except maybe wait until it gets better. <br /> <br /> For me, this offer goes away from commercials, without any real teaser. As we sat around watching these shows, we all expected what would happen. <br /> <br /> The cavernous women's ring was really big for us. I am a good reviewer, I take everything, but I must say that the cave men are comparable to the old show, my mother, the car . I give it number 2, just because they deserve 1 better than 1 because they already spent money on it.
