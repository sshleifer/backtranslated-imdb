Dahmer, a confused young man. Damer, a confusing film. Granted, I had some beer while watching the movie, but this does not explain why I was bored of this start and end, the only logical thing in the film is explaining the text at the beginning and end of the movie. Deadly things, which will be the film, are just boring and time-consuming images. <br /> <br /> We do not see actual murders, it's just a bunch of hints. Sometimes, you only feel that Dahmer dreams of the whole thing, but you know that it is not, because it depends on a real story and that's what really happened, at least most of it. But what happened? It's not easy to know. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time in this movie. I did not like one thing and I felt cheated when it was all over. <br /> <br /> * / *****
