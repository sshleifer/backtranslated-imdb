Curt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot as a gymnast trained in a special game that is hunted by a group of ninja, but these ninja will not have a chance, especially as Kabut is a gymnast! The entire film "Jimkata", a very bad film, horrible acting, horrifying texts, and really inefficient guidance, makes quality less than human standards, yet this film is so bad it becomes really funny. I mean dialogue like "I know I'll fainted!" Or "Ha !, through your!" Add only to the picture value that Gimkata gets after that. Besides (wisely) he is the only film that has a gymnast hero who finds things swing at the moment.
