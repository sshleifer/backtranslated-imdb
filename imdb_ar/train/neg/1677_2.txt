Unlike others, I refuse to call this unfortunate excuse for a film a triumph of elegance on substance (I do not want to give the pattern a bad name). Still, is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. "Wonderland" leaves one wondering just why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the green light to this dismal and intertwined mess. Biography of porn star John Holmes? A study of who the man was and why he went to work and how it affected him? Great. Bound to be convincing, it must be amusing. She is supposed to be enlightened and wonderful about a million levels (and I have absolutely no interest in pornography). <br /> <br /> But a confusing and violent study like Rashomon was done about a series of murders that Holmes underwent after the profession ended? Who in hell cares? What ideas do we gain? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of the life of John Holmes - that he was an illustrious star! Wonderland may have been about anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult movie star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things go wrong about a thousand times, the image is loaded with jerkoff tricks - freeing an annoying submachine gun, a Dorme-95 dwarf photographer, unnecessary graphics and animations, etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and a unique master figure, the director (and I use the term loosely) compiled dozens of techniques or other films and decided to name the resulting chaos with a film, among them: Modern Look, "Traffic" or "minority report" hectic cutting style, often incomprehensible, throwing pieces in the film "natural killers of birth" or "28 days later." The loud music fills "Goodfellas" or "Blow;" at every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the sequence of the title "Wonderful" from "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can." The list goes on and on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie. I had real hopes for that. Wonderland has been around for years; if the killings were confirmed instead of the murders themselves, I think it would have worked. If the murders (and Holmes's growing involvement with the unfamiliar types of L.A.) have pointed to the end of the profession, or the end of the 1970s, I think the film could have been meaningful; it could have a purpose. As it is - meaningless. Pointless. Who cares about the number of visions in a series of murders that are not generally known by the public? The case is not famous enough worthy of such a painstaking examination. <br /> <br /> This film should have been the third film of the "John Holmes Story". This is. interval. It can work. What is that? Oh, true, true, they did not want to tell the story of a traditional rise and fall. They did not want to do "Boogie Nights", "Goodfellas", "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, they succeeded. There is a big difference between those films and "Wonderland". The difference is that those films are good. <br /> <br />
