Why does this film fall under the criteria? Ultimately, the answer lies in the ruthless, ruthless scenario. Travolta (thin / medium-looking) looks somewhat black (I must say, even with the huge mullet) and Gros are both very well behaved, two young men in stylish clothes but still harassing New Yorkers who look To open their own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It's very boring that it's not really worth knowing what's going on at the height of the film at any level. It is clear that Kelly Preston exudes sexual appeal and sexually charged dance with her husband to be Travolta one of the few pleasures in the film. Charles Martin Smith is very enjoyable to watch KGB honors struggling "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot had been changed a bit so that the settings would not change from New York to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which existed in the former Soviet Union?) You see the film ... Apparently, In 1986 and is ready for the 1987 version. I think Paramount stumbled upon the release of the film until January 1989 because of the incredible plot. Were reportedly considered "intolerable". However, this $ 6,000,000 film generated just over $ 163,000 in embarrassing revenues, only briefly shown in places like Texas and Colorado before going directly to the video. This is a testimony to the overall quality of this film.
