If you are a person who found a great TV comedy according to Jim, this will shake your world. Can I praise that proving that good talent, good writing and charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to broadcast waste like Jim Belloschi's show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a "thank you" to the great geniuses who loved the first film, "Big, Steam, Brown". It's exactly what fans of this film deserve and less Belushi. Jim's comedies are no longer selected in projects and are far from being able to standard blower butcher. Look for him to try to show off all his lack of talent in every project he launches on the public such as a shitty zoo chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your bonus.
