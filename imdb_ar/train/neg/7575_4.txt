A retired diplomat, played by Michael Yorke, is heading to Russia to avenge the Russian gangs that killed the diplomat's son. There he meets the diplomat with an exceptionally strong and respected Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangs to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old clicks of the 1980s that always portrayed Russians as evil villains undermined by the good government of the United States. It is interesting to see this time the Russian man as a hero. <br /> <br /> It's not a great click, it's really a flick of action B. Michael York confers some qualities on this medium film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian policeman as a "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Michael York was so well represented that he had a chemistry with anyone doing a scene with him. Disappointingly, Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul is in this movie for a longer period, the flick of verb B will be higher than average. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's nice to look at him in the first 15 minutes of the film. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is the usual bad guy. He is very blond and wicked in this film. <br /> <br /> Rent this click if there is nothing else on TV to watch. he is fine. Do not suck too bad. Decent work scenes. The representation can be better, the plot may have moved faster, but hey, you can see the look of Russia today!
