It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have "gray things" will agree that this film is not working only. <br /> <br /> The problems lie in the direction, take a look at the limitations and lack of depth in the character building. It was very hard to say a comedy when I expected to laugh when I used those words. Let's take a look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> The brother and sister in their mid-30s seem to have been well caught. They meet a stranger in a garden, and Heather Graham's character walks over to her and asks her the most intimate questions that can be run by half a sane person in the other direction or at least a police officer screaming. Then he walks awkwardly and makes some stupid statements as he falls on him. Then after one date, they all go out together, fall in love with her and decide to get married in Vegas in one week ???? Hello Does anyone feel stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and meets this person who says about 10 words we see on screen and wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry just meaningless. It is definitely a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the direction made it perfectly flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather is headed upside down with her as well when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (a very shallow figure) kiss or more so that he was less kiss than ever that chemistry might be there. I found it not romantic and unfamiliar, while many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality is that Heather was the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was the appearance of Sue Kramer for the first time as a director, and for me it was very chewy. It will take a lot of skill to make this movie works and IMHO can do with the best writers, casting and direction.
