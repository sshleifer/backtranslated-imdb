"In 1955, Tobias Schenerbom disappeared in the Amazon region of Peru ... A year later, he came out of the woods ... naked, it took 45 years to return" supposed to "keep the river to your right" is "the story of a modern cannibal." In fact, anyone looking for some foresight in cannibals will be frustrating. The first half of the film is similar to the new Ginuea travel record, often promoting original art. The second half relies on constant images of the Peruvian eater, but in fact it is. Unless of course, you are interested in home movies for a Jewish wedding, or Sneerbaum offers his former male lovers. give up. Great disappointment and not really "the story of a modern cannibal." - Merck
