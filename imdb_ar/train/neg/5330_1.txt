Some have commented here that this is the worst Elvis movie ever. Well, they're only partially right. For me, this is the worst movie ever happened! I have never seen anything as cruel, insulting, despicable, and against human nature as this film. It's a real embarrassment for making movies, and that's not so bad, it's good. There's no fun in the trashy travy that you'll get here as in some other Elvis bad movies like Clambake. This is too rotten to sit through the painful. Clean garbage. Native Americans should prosecute their poor clich√©s and typical treatment here. In fact, perhaps all humans should prosecute the perpetrators of the crime and misuse the film of the genre as a whole, seriously. Grade: F
