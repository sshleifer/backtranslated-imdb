Often a movie comes down in their minds and reminds me that my taste in the movies I'm trying to watch is not always wrong. I usually stay away from things like this, but I was duped by some glowing reviews and Rohmer proportions. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and interesting novelty in production where Rohmer mainly discourage actors from painting the back of the French Revolution. This fades quickly and becomes as interesting as watching the paint dry on the paint of the figures scene. What remains before us is a boring and suffocating film about aristocrats in France in the eighteenth century. None of the characters are attractive or sympathetic. The pace is very weak, and the dialogue is very hard. It is clear that the thrill is a strange concept for Romer, where I ended up not caring about his head, which was home to, or was supposed to be, the demon of the revolution. The film has benefited greatly from some aspects of emotional accumulation and musical score (there is some high end classical music used in the end). Despite being "talkative", the film is very much like a silent film, and the worst kind of film in that film, a boring and uninteresting film about interesting topics without limits. Only the most intelligent French historians will find something to take from this film, because the dose seems to paint well-known events from a new angle (the lady is English and property). Otherwise, avoid yawning at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (you have been twice exhaled).
