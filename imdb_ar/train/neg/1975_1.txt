To be quite honest, I have not seen much Western movies but I've seen enough to know what is good. This is by far the worst west on the planet today. First, there are black people in the Wild West? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a wonderful movie on the wall everyone would like to like a bit, no, quite backward! Secondly, on that day, black women, especially black women, were not vulnerable to pregnancy or the use of arms. Asian chick speaks perfect English? If the setting is west, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the lesbian chick was a lot villain and the film was just nonsense from the start. Do not miss me, I'm not racist or white, so do not repeat after reading this film, but this film is the worst show for the black people I have seen in my life!
