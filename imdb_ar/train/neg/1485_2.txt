For your personal benefit, it would be best to ignore any positive comments about this film. This flick isnthin. Now, I like (at least theoretically) low-budget horror movies, but this film commits the worst mistake a low budget click can make: it takes itself seriously. Unfortunately, this is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the deadly Beane clan of the British Ilses that have been moved to modern times. The premise is interesting, but there are two things that instantly flirt around this movie once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the larger name in the CD Jenna Jameson? She is a woman who looks less than average and can not act, and has a secondary role. Answer: Looks like she's a known porn star (as you've undoubtedly read in other reviews), so I think this is a "gorgeous" look to her. It gives the film the "need to identify names" that are most needed, it seems. Her higher bills are not an indication of her talent, yet they are indicative of the lack of interest of the other representatives. <br /> <br /> # 2 - How can filmmakers be stupid enough to think that Canada could have passed Ireland? It does not seem remotely like Ireland. The guest house / victims is this large wooden frame of North America, which is an Edwardian framework. They were supposed to have surpassed Beane completely and developed a story that also happened in NA. If you're going to make a film in Ireland, it's better to have more than one character in an Irish accent (and that was really bad with a bad Irish accent.) Now, This was not so bad if the director did not try to make the next "Night of the Living Dead," but it seemed to be. so sad. I could have had some fun with it. In fact, some scenes were not as unintentional as they were. <br /> <br /> Like the evil bowel scene, the woman was chained to the table, stripped naked, and then sliced ​​slices were opened. That's funny, you ask? Well, in the version of the deleted scene, the mutant killer pulls miles miles after miles of intestine. It's really funny after a moment. And what respects cannibals eat intestines, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat pork, ribs and drum sticks. Well, some other actors who were annoying: the creepy little Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he was supposed to be a student. In fact, it's a big ball and a loser like his name. Which explains why Gillian Lee's character is as disturbing to him as he is. <br /> <br /> Gillian Les checked her IMDb link, and it seems important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide whether it is fun or pathetic to know that just two years after graduating, a student with nude pornographic scenes is in a bath with a man named Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if her ex-colleagues have seen this film? If they have, hope they get the message: avoid this fate! Go to college !!! Can continue, but why. If you love gore, you will find something to recover in this click, but nothing more.
