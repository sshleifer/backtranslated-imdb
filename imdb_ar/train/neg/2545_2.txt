There is laughter in this film, this is for sure. Michael Keaton's talent was funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me a lot about this film is how wonderful all the characters are in practice. Unlike the two major chefs, everyone is joking. I mean, those losers in the small town are not free of rudeness. You just watch and think, man, these losers must be out of work. In addition, the US factory worker is depicted as lazy and not boring. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Sure, in the end they all come together, but I did not enjoy the trip there.
