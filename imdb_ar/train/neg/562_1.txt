I love musicals but as a Dickens fan, I hate this. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workshop? London's poor go out to sing? Vagin and Dodger walk in the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly and Fagan became insane in prison. ** End of the spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reid is very weak like Sykes, and does little to waste to refer to his evil. Worse yet is that Mark Leicester is Oliver, who often encounters awkward and negative questions as to whether he is truly the main character. His portrayal does not in any way help the fact that the best they can do when he sings is a girl's voice. They guessed that they did not realize that it could be found three times in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Dickens' self-respecting admirers have adhered to the stunning David Lynn in 1948 or the BBC's 6-hour film from mid-80's. Avoid this puffy whitening of the musical.
