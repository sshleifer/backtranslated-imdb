Exactly what you expect from Movie B. Derived, unjustified nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better behaved (better written) written and better directed, and so on. But then I think it will not be a B movie. The actors were largely sucked up, in fact this looked somewhat like a ring of vampire killer thieves or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Chips must be. She is certainly the Queen of Screaming in the New Millennium. Representation is not really important in these films, but it was better than any other actor. She is also a hot chimney, where she wore it in a film that is wearing a plastic jump suit for a full movie - Wow! Behind it is absolutely stunning in this outfit, I mean that every time you spin it, you can help but you have to check it out. Toward the end of the film, the viewer is rewarded with a vision that is entirely beloved. <br /> <br /> So, if you have a more flexible horror film (like me), check it out. If not, you should avoid at all costs.
