This film is supposed to happen in and around Seattle. Why do Porteau Cove Park P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L appear? Regional parks are located in Canada, not in the United States. The Inspector uses a complete Palm Pilot tool to "read" that someone has hacked the computer in the wedding shop. I did not know that this was possible using the database storage device. A woman appears in the film without any introduction and is never presented. We learn halfway to the film where this woman works in the prosecutor's office. Then, at the Correctional Center, the guard actually organizes the gang through the door and keeps his back to the culprit !! This will never happen in a real reformist environment. The director has actually spoiled this - and this is not happening in real life. Acting is sufficient. The plot is good. Good cinematography. However, many of the errors in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 sounds.
