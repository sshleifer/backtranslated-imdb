The classic movie mark is that it looks like ages like wonderful red wine. This film is not Cabernet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the film represent a regrettable mutation that now engulfs us at night in sit-ins and that dialogue is confused and preached. But let's take a look at the old theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Sixty years of history comes wisdom. Since "Watching the River Rhine", writer Lillian Hellman has been portrayed as a play character in her own Bednisk called the real life story "Julia" of her book "Pentimento". As one of the most repulsive defenders of the Western-based USSR, it is clear that her theme in the play and film was to urge America to move to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and the fascist international communism, who had just demonstrated their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and film, where Lillian went to her tomb as a communist who hated America. This film tells the familiar stupidity of the educated elites of the educated elite that formed the American left at that time, just as happened with the left-full moon from the left to Dili Kos. Michael Moore bought conspiracy theories and again gave assistance and comfort to those destroying America.
