A badly written text without any beloved characters. As a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about two cocky friends who scam to bring women into bed with them (without sex scenes) and another (quasi-religious) friend who sometimes cheats but is basically considered the man who mastered. The three friends meet separately and fall for the same woman (Amanda Pitt). Somehow this is done without really any love story. The three men stop being friends because they are historians for them separately. They were deceived because of their friendship because they deceived women. - A bad movie
