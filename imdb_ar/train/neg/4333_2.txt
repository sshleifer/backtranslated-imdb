Quote: theurgist: Anyone Who Has I. It was possible to see more than 50 people this movie as it is, a smart package for a good modern classic film, yes, it does not have a great movie set or a huge budget, but still They are well executed and have made me hooked for the duration. <br /> <br /> The IQ of more than 50 you say .. This means that you have an IQ. Less than 50 .. Its name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! Meaning that he must have something like me first to do .. <br /> <br /> It's all about "OK" if .. You change the title and there are no characters bearing the name CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Note: Do not attach a movie if you do not know anything about movies. But I think that less than 50 years, you will not know what the hell I shout at him ... <br /> <br /> Peace!
