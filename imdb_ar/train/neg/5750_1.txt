In fact, it was very fun ... in "God, how to make hell". If you make fun of movies ... and do it ... follow them and watch them ... but if you really think "Is this a good movie?" I do. <br /> <br /> This movie was sucked from the first scene with the worst representation I've ever seen in any movie .... usually get five minutes before you realize "this movie may be sucked" .. but no, you know right off the bat . This film talks about Edgar Allen Bo ... never tried to explain it though, to people who did not keep the life story of Bo ... so I do not know if anything that was said is really. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around author Ethan Bo with his cousin Anne ... Both of them are descendants of Edgar Allan Bo ... or are they?!? Apparently, people give what their ancestors did. This man Ethan Bo is actually Ethan's "entry", which is supposed to be the descendants of the "House of the Courtyard" story by Edgar Allen Bo. Anne's brother sometimes appears to try to rape her ... Ann is also being stalked, at some point in the film, by three different people in the same street (seriously, three ... they look like her behind her screams and she does not even realize) . The characters that kill all the time, finally appear to try to save the day .... but they can not. In the end, Ann shoots Ethane while trying to kill her best friend. Of course, before you shoot him, she must scream "Now!" This movie should never be seen!
