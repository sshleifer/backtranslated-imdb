This version is beautiful, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books from her childhood, but the weary, acting-acting William Hertz style is not entirely suited to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and the weary Charlotte Gainsborough like a bored, tired, toothless teenager! I can not believe that they have passed on the scene of Edward's wonderful marriage proposal from the end of the book, one of the most exciting moments in literature. I appreciate that they have finally used this obvious young woman to play Jane, a figure who is supposed to be 18, but if you want to see a version of the rapprochement of characters and passion for the novel, please see copy 70 with George S. Scott and Susan York. York was very old, tall and beautiful to play Jane, but no one touched the character of Rochester as Scott did.
