People who actually love the child problem (1990) need to check their heads. Who will take the idea of ​​watching a malicious little boy wreak havoc on others and consider it funny? The film is not funny, never, in any way, the beginning of the end. She wants to be a cartoon, but the writers do not realize that paper-smacking is not funny when people are attacked by bears, or beaten with bats. It may be funny in animation, but not animated. <br /> <br /> The little hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver) who, from birth, has been placed on the front doors of adoptive parents for adoption. Families reject him, because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage where nuns are ransacked and pen letters are written to the convicted Bow-Tie Killer (Michael Richards). It was quickly adopted by Ben and Flo Hely (the late John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasebek), who die to have a child, to be like all other parents in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jr. becomes a member of the Healy family, and "Little" Ben cares about him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear on the site, or throwing a cat at his father, Big Ben (Jack Warden) ), A fanatical politician. <br /> <br /> I think we're supposed to care about Junior so we can root when he takes revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, a whore, a completely selfish soul, and a little girl - despising adopted children - are such a pampered bag. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last laugh is not funny, it means, cruel, and sometimes life threatening. <br /> <br /> What is the film's message? Children must solve the problems of violence and vandalism? Should they seek friendship by writing to convicted murderers? They certainly do not like being a bad child. Junior is not one - he's just a little sadist. I used to have a time when it was bad for kids to beat others. Now, everyone laughs when Junior beats the kids with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this movie is marketed as a "family comedy". What's worse is that the child's problem has been rated PG. What was MPAA thinking when they saw this? There are a lot of offensive words and vituperative phrases here, one might wonder about the split between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy this, but parents will experience what is happening on screen. For most people, the child's problem will be considered a "guilty fun" classic; a film is admittedly shameful, although the prevailing view, as the most serious viewers put it, is that the film is a piece of waste.
