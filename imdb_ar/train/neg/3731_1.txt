I have been raised in a "very Christian" family since birth. I was saved before I saw this film and the rest of the series and was forced to see it in a group of young people in my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw that when I was about 12 years old and had nightmares about him for years. I used to get up in bed and listen to my mother's footsteps upstairs. If I do not hear her footsteps, I'll sneak up to the top floor to make sure they have not been ruined. I used to pray hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of forgetting Jesus. This is certainly not something I will offer my children until they grow up a lot, after all. It took me years to shake the fear that this film gave me.
