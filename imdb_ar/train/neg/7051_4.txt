Blue Juice is a movie dealing with problems related to growth and sincerity for yourself, and represents a mind suitable for those who love surfing the Internet and Cornwall. Sean Pertoy is the real star of this film, while Catherine Zeta Jones is the most famous role playing girlfriend and plays Ewan McGregor as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like windsurfing or Cornwall in its simplest form, it will take a long time before the film hints at being fun. Start slow and spend a lot of time on long shots of just a little interesting scenery. In addition, many of the main characters lead to being one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the shallow characters, you have no idea why it behaves in the situations where it is placed. <br /> <br /> It is only the characters of Ewan, Shawn and Catherine who make the film so important a video, and that's why it was only released on video in the United States after Ioan and Catherine arrived at the top spot.
