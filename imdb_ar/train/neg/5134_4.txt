It seems that the calamities are a terrifying horror that meets a supernatural film. A group of thugs stole a paramilitary from the payroll at Camp Pendleton, California. They boarded a cargo plane that kidnapped the pilot and his daughter with demands to fly to Mexico. Along the way, one of the greedy thieves decides to save their money from landing in an atom field watched by strange-looking horrors. This is not just a scarecrow in running ... you can kill. Representation is no better than terrible dialogue. Humor attempts are not funny. The budget is very low and was completely filmed in the dark. <br /> <br /> Staff includes Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Christina Sanborn and BJ.
