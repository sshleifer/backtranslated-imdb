This film is described as a movement / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Peloschi mark it as a cheerful band movie. <br /> <br /> However, the absurd female introduction begins with a number of ironic distortions that do little to disguise the fabricated end. The film moves between comedy (description used loosely) and surreal drama with some scenes outside the context in which it is thrown. Misrepresentation (Title Owner) acts badly and does not help the actress in a scenario that requires some incredible, extreme character to be photographed. James Peloschi is the only one who plays his role well but also fails the weak text. One to avoid.
