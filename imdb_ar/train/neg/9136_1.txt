When the film started, I was shocked to see it filmed using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the normal home movie. Even directly to DVD movies must have better production values ​​than this! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Often, the film seems to have been produced seriously by pasting the camera onto a tripod and running it - without a camera person! Close-ups and anything like camera work are absent in some scenes where they may have worked and in other cases there are too many close or in a bad frame. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film revolves around gay men who want to get married. As if it had been done nearly a decade ago, the only option was to marry Vermont - times have certainly changed. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage can not in any way be attributed to this film - if there is anything, it will return homosexuals back instead of helping because the film stinks and never tries to address the problem seriously. According to the film, religious people are monolithic idiots who carry gospels everywhere and shoot people, as well as wives with narrow-minded homosexual couples when they learn that their wives are living a lie. I'm sure it gives a sincere opportunity to both sides on this issue! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - there's nothing about the movie that shows any professionalism at all, and I'm reluctant to name this movie. It's more like a home movie and not even worth listing on IMDb or even embedding in the IMDb list down 100 list of the worst rated movies ever. The representation is terrible, the writing is awful, the direction (if there is anything) is terrible, the camera action is terrible and the plot is awful. It's my home movie !! There's nothing positive I can say about it in any way but it makes Ed Wood movies look like Oscar's competitors in comparison and I'm sure Mr Wood's ghost smiles every time someone sees that mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care whether you're gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how they managed to create DVDs from it. I suppose one actor burns them on his home computer during his free time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word "bad"! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the only lady in the film is a real lawyer, is not being able to read an important prerequisite ?! I just say. "<br /> <br /> Finally, with gay marriage an important and important issue, can not we have a better film than this one?" This one, unfortunately, only calls for laughter.
