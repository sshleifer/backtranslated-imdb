This kind of film has become an old hat now, right? The whole thing is nostalgic nostalgia that turned itself into a cycle of reactions. <br /> <br /> Surely this sounds like a good idea: a wonderful band, some good gags, some human drama about what it could be / maybe was.

You end up seeing more than one person or two rather than getting short deals for everyone. The surface it creates is not only annoying, it is crazy. Text below average does not help.
