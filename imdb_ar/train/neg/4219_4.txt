This amateur film was filmed on video, not "dramatic drama" as it notes that the DVD liner boasted falsely. I've seen far better things than undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with a taxi ride all over Jakarta. It was possible to make this movie using a single video camera, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content was later merged. Editing is very difficult. The final modification may have been made using two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, rather than using an appropriate editor. Maybe they did the editing in the taxi too? English translations have been translated by someone who is not fluent in English, for example, "Where do you go now?" To say that the quality of production on an equal footing with Blair is a generous charm. If you are not so far afraid, this film has been an ambitious and creative endeavor, with many wonderful and unconventional images from all over Jakarta.
