Except for the recognition of some nice films, I can hardly say anything positive about this film. The only real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to stay with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and practice his own life. The abundant scenes "emotionally strong" do not conform to this plot, and because of misconduct, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to present Anthony's dilemma and finally comes up with an easy solution. The characters do not seem to be evolving, although it's hard to talk about any characters ... maybe except Sonny. Players can not play too much, and when some of them have to play, they indulge themselves in amateur delusions. I wonder what ruined the film more: surface scenario, throwing all the potential of the plot, or bad disposition, which irritates any attraction may be left.
