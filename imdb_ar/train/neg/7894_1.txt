Unless you are an Anglican Christian, let you become Egyptian and avoid such a biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Too bad - why you see why IMDb lists the most appropriate reviews at the top of the list - it was because of these things that I just wasted what started in a good evening on this film. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the plot began strong enough - I was attracted to the film and I was interested until the moment when I gave the Bible sermons. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie has caused such outrage that I have been registered with IMDb for the first time just to complain about it - I hope, at least by doing so, save someone else's evening. <br /> <br /> Straw - What a Christian act on my side ;-)
