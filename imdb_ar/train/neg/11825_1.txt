This film is part of one of the best novels ever, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film on IMDb give recognition to the original author but I did so I do not see this at the beginning of the film, only credit in the end saying "suggested by Silas Marner's book." I suggested? It was only a complete reversal of all the basic elements of the story: <br /> <br /> An old man, unjust and sad, craftsman, poor and lonely, stole all his money. One night a girl walks to his door while her mother dies as she dies in the snow outside. The man takes her and takes her to one day demanding that the local box (or the rich politician here) adopt the child. Is the one who gave birth to the child during an illicit relationship years ago. The battle then breaks out over who should have legal guardianship over the child. <br /> <br /> On this and every other side of the film, the story is very similar. In just one I can find the difference. Silas Marner was suffering from epilepsy - but this may have strained Mr Martin's ability to act. Moreover, his hair was dyed in some carrot juices (supposed to make him seem smaller, but actually make him look more clown)! There is also the addition of senseless jokes, which this comedian can not resist bringing up a story that has no role in it and only detracts from the depth of the story. Such as when the child cries in the courtroom declaring that she will only be happy with the man who has borne her throughout these years. This is transferred in the film by a girl who removes nasal congestion on her nose bridge to make her cry! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that legal aspects and fairness in the film industry allow such a film to be filmed. If you are the guardian of George Elliott, I will insist on compensation. If you are Steve Martin, I will send profits to this property, or to the poor. At least its title should be Silas Marner - adapted from Martin S. Or better remove them from the archive! <br /> <br /> If you're interested in this story - and I hope you are - just dismiss it and see Silas Marner. Or read the book! The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) adapted it in the 1980s.
