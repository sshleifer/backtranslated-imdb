I saw 7.5 IMDb rating on this film and based on that I decided to watch this movie that my roommate rented in the room. She had seen it before. She said: "It is funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it." Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies, this is worth 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I have seen in my life, this is not worth more than 3. Any movie I can guess which is always going to happen then is always not good for me . The characters are incredible, how the act is absolutely unrealistic and their motives are fabricated. The drama has ended and the songs are not fantastic. My biggest problem in Bollywood movies is the lack of precision. All feelings are exaggerated and therefore not realistic at all. Any emotion or bond between the less subtle characters must be maximized by an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the father-son relationship was more like a relationship between friends than a parent-child relationship without having to move it through a five-minute song. The complete stupid humor was not complete with a funny or necessary laugh track (we've got it, Laxman is not the most sharp instrument in the shed). If a film tries to draw tears through the most possible means, it is not useful, it is a bit embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> In general if someone has lung cancer in the final stage, his son who lives with him will know that something is wrong Without having to tell him. Lots of plot holes to calculate. In the beginning, the film was fun and pleasant in the way Bollywood films are made to people who do not watch them eagerly, but it becomes boring. You need to produce a lot of skill in a movie that is amusing and loving. The best way to do this is usually not having all the entertaining parts in the first half of the movie and all the heart parts in the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER Over ***** She probably had a little more depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much at all. I spent time laughing at the stupidity of the film over parts that were supposed to be funny. I did not remove one tear and did not feel it, but I felt angry at being disgusted at the attempt at the dramatic end. I would not recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie kind of sad.
