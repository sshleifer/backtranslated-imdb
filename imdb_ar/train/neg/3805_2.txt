Wrong ... this movie sucked. Lots. <br /> <br /> I've read some other reviews. There seems to be a lot of people who think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I've seen many of his movies, hoping to get something done. But no, they just suck. The trash is badly written. All characters are very stereotyped (not to mention rather stupid). The plot ... I think it's supposed to be mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, in any other film I saw in his film. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, look for this movie. If you are under the age of 50, do not bother. (If you love Woody Allen and you're under the age of 50 ... Well, you're an idiot.) I do not know what to say.
