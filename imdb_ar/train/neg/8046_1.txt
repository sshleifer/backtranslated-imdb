No? I do not think so! Well, in this case, all you have to do is stay away from "Do You Wanna Know A Secret", because it's just a ruthless slant yet "Scream" has no value and no value at all. The plot is very silly. The characters are unbearably stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can draw from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I still know what I did last summer," where the events take place in a similar place and the murderer's motives are equally stupid. Why anyone wants to steal ideas from junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete puzzle for me, anyway. At least, this film can be relied on the precious shelf of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in this trash, regardless of their mind, is very unattractive. A year after her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, who has not yet been resolved, and her adulterous boyfriend and four college students going to Florida for a spring break in a luxury beach house, are killed. The killer did not move throughout the year, but now he follows prose to Florida and begins to slaughter them while leaving behind the address letter as a kind of business card. You do not really need to be an expert in horror so that you quickly identify the face that hides behind the indescribable funny mask, and the book's attempts to put you on the wrong track are utterly embarrassing. Because the plot is too thin, most of the film is an irrelevant charge, including sub-plots about the incompetent Floridian police force and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal standing. The unintentional murder occurs outside the screen (do not you hate it when it happens?), So there's no T & A to enjoy and you'd better not let me start with the quality of the dialog boxes. Suffering through such crap only makes you realize that the exhilarating spirit of the 80 slashers' gone forever.
