I really do not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. The typical American plot, I'm sorry. The guy gets the girl's type in the end. And London has a single rail line? Bank of London ?? The Bank of England is what it really is !! - Yet I liked the look of Tracy Island and the thunderbirds themselves. And the British were the bad guys? (Apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened with that? They kept saying stuff like "The Thunderbirds" - but not known as "The Thunderbirds" in the series, why do you do it ?? I would like to see this again in 20 years with more British actors.
