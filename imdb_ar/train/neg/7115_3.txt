Well, the introduction, by offering the coffin to a free nest for anyone who dies of horror during the movie, is a wonderful game. So the first "jasmine scene" is drawn largely and not funny, it is funny. The actual outline of the film is fairly decent, there is at least a little authentic food to think about the behavior of characters, the evolution of the chart is decent with the continuation of horror films. The representation is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie does not fall exactly as 1/10 does. It's not terrible enough to get the least or even the second. If I read the script, I would say that there is a possibility that it will be a good film. It's just that direction and horrendous production that destroys the movie. It's a bad movie, but there are far worse movies.
