I chose to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for the Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that it could have been far from the mark in judging the quality. <br /> <br /> The film, some reviewers, has noticed that it does not contain much shooting - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / enemy in front of your little boy ... or forcing someone to take a ceramic spoon to prove his allegiance. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleones in the film "Godfather" in Coppola which appears to be featured here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film but the quality of the two is clearly different from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended about violent hushashin .. There is no big cinema here. At best, it can be considered better than the usual Run Run Shaw production values.
