This is the voice of Stan and the name that revolves around their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother listing the basic flaws in this film because they are quite clear without saying. Small things, like this "new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" despite the death of the stars for more than thirty years when it was made. Small things like that. <br /> <br /> Bad ideas are that there are actors playing with batons who are called "Laurel and Hardy". As bad as it may have been, he might have succeeded. For a really bad idea, try to convince the two representatives to impersonate a duo character. Well, they may claim to be brothers, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Well, forget his strange stranger "Cousin Larry" in Perfect strangers game, and see him in true romance. Here, though, stinks. Perhaps not all of this is his fault, and like the director and the support representative - all of whom are better than the material - he was probably desperate for money. There are those who claim that Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This Pinchot did not help this cause. What is Stan? welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Just approaching Stan's commercial mark, although the cry is exaggerated to the point of boredom that can not be written about. Gailard Sartain's performance is a little better than the class you have, although it's like saying what's worse - getting into dogs' dirt or kicking at the attackers? <br /> <br /> Do the original copies remember their second time and the collective work is intuitive and innate? Well, it's completely absent, replaced by two stupid old men and very foggy jokes so you can stop the bus through the gaps. While the original versions contained pieces that can be summarized in two tablets, this piece contains some hummium mummy (and its bad title!) Mixed with sibling scenario for boys. I can not claim to have seen each of Laurel's and Hardy's 108 films, but I think it's a safe bet that even their club would qualify. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem was whether the originals were a type of play themselves, or at least using their own dialects. At least it felt natural and unnecessary, unlike the alleged cartoons. Since when did Stan behave badly, and so much? "I would give you the cremation of the dead"; "I like to fall between my friend." Stop it! <br /> <br /> Only the momentary moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character that Larry Harmon co-starred in the movie L & H. Of course Harmon bought the copyright of the name (how disturbing it was to see Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this farce. <br /> <br /> The questions are many. Will Stan and Wales make a lot of gaps if they're alive today? Do they make glass of mummies with broken bottles? Did Stan hit the genitals and spears ended in a big CGI final? Let us hope that this does not happen. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think this was in unbelief in how terrible it was. Why was this film made in the first place? Who do they think they love? Probably the worst film I've ever seen, absolutely disgusting I'm tired of watching it after the first five minutes only. Around that much fun like putting your head in a trap while hot red poker and a pungent disco are introduced into the back.
