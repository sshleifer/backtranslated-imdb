One of the most boring bits ever .. if you can even name them. I will not see this even if it ends up being a kind of pornographic film, which looks exactly like it. The fact that you see a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kinds of movies for young people, so who were they really looking for when they did this sleep festival? My favorite part of this film is cover art and that's the only reason why I chose to search for this movie, which happened to be part of the suspense classics 50s. After watching the other films in this 50's, we realize that it belongs somewhere else . So, if you are in a mood for decent greenery in the woods, I recommend just before dawn and ultimate terror.
