It has been nearly 30 years, and I still hate all participants in this film. The worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I see this, I never thought of Rivers, one way or the other. After watching this movie, I had an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on TV. <br /> <br /> I have drifted into this - despite my best judgment - by peer pressure. However, when they came out of the theater, these friends swore oath for not exceeding the optional film again. After nearly thirty years, we still carry mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> On the bed of death, one of my sorrows will be the time I spent in the hope that this film will improve. It never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have any choice, prefer a preference to sit in spite of this movie. <br /> <br /> I have only registered for IMDb comments in the hope that I can warn others to watch this movie. If I could save only one person from watching this, my presence on this earth would be justified.
