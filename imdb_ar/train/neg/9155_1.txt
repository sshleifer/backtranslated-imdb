This was the worst film I've ever seen. It was like "homework" to separate the film. It completely misses the mark when it comes to the "message" you are trying to migrate. Characters exaggerated, misrepresentation, as well as for the plot ... Well, it's totally silly. The cover of the shot is what made me think it might be a decent film, and the co-actor is handsome and that's it. Moral This Movie: Never Control the Movie! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you'll be better off than the first. It was painful to see him very frankly, I was surprised that anyone would spend money on producing and distributing it!
