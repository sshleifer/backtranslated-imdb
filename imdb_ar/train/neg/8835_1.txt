Before I watch this movie I read a review here stating that this movie can be one of the best movies ever !? Ha ha scene scenery is growing tension fine ... of the disturbing characters in this film. From the little girl who talks about a jargon and tries to sink the little boy, the killer runs without any notice (and who was the man on the beach speaking to the little boy?) She did not respond to her in this film. Do not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and continue ... <br /> <br /> The characterization is wonderful, but the writing is appalling.Every character, in every scene, says or does something incredible, There are no solutions to the problems that have developed during the film, which makes it confusing and ultimately a waste of time.
