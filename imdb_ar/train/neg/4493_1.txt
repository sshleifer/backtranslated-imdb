I tried to remove anything that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you saw the first movie or at least I knew the general picture, so if some of these things are not logical. <br /> <br /> Plot: This movie excels the audience on a trend with philosophical distraction over and over again in an attempt to get a cross theme. We have been bombarded repeatedly by questions about purpose, destiny and choice, and we have had to endure the long sessions of intransigence that it contains. <br /> <br /> The newcomers wake up from a dream in the last film, now begins a period of realization about its existence. There is a lot of revelation in this film, which I'll be vague around so as not to look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you are still concerned that the ambiguous signals will spoil the movie, do not read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The power of faith has been revealed and weakened. As the strengths and weaknesses of love are detected and its temporary nature. The interdependence between humans and technology and our belief in technology has also been revealed. The importance of choice and experience was revealed. Explain more of the things revealed will go into a lot of details, so I will refrain (as you ask guidelines to write a comment). BTW, by the words "revealed" I mean our ears and eyes were pounded like nails. <br /> <br /> Story: So how does Niu get the gang from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next film? In short, they maintain faith, exploit and influence excessive behavior in style and time of fire as if it were old fashioned. (After this show, I hope filmmakers and industry makers alike will learn a little more precision and originality than). More about that later. So as not to spoil anything, I will not say more than I already did promotional materials: Neo is still trying to figure out a matrix, looking for answers while trying to save humans, and Zion, all chasing the bad guys. And his followers. The film largely captures where the last movie stopped. <br /> <br /> Movement: While martial arts and firearms compete for their predecessor in fairly equal parts, this film focuses more on martial arts than on firearms, adding swords. , SAIS, etc. into the mix. Special effects are often used and waved to the audience so that they become very tired. I have discussed this film with friends and co-workers alike, and almost all of them have found some series of events - especially the "Battle of Smith" that we all heard will be in the film - to be long and tedious. This is a huge red sign for lovers of motion, because the end of the sequence of motion either makes you want a little more, or quite simply the awe that just happened. <br /> <br /> These scenes do not fight. It is overly serialized and the highest wooden sequences are uninspiring. In the first film, there was a real sense of desperation for some events, a feeling that the fighting was to survive, not just a good appearance (I do not honestly believe they run the reload anyway) in black and leather. Go to Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind you of the good fight series - you will not regret it. In addition, the "matrix capabilities" that people have in reloading are inconsistent, and what they actually do is not fixed. The first film had contradictions here, but it was not too blatant - unlike reloading. <br /> <br /> Special effects are poured on and on. Everything that a person does, whether he jumps, hops or rotates, and in many cases poses himself only, is slow, dead, or excessive in some kind of destruction. It is clear that W Bros had a lot of money to throw in this film, and the boy they threw it, without any real tuning. Sharp editors could have really helped, but the first film has been a great success and it is clear that free governance has given us, which is what leads us to do so. . . <br /> <br /> Personality and dialogue: I have already said more or less that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical expressions. Actors can not bring much depth to their character when the script and direction displace or completely discard an audience's face. At no time is the audience given a critical and critical importance so that they can think about the personality on their own. <br /> <br /> Keanu's performance is harsh at best. Keanu is good at acting puzzled, and that's all he does in this film. He made a decent attempt to show his passion between New and Trinity, but he is still stable. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make everything from Morpheus from Moses to Henry V, and to be as wonderful as the cat. Through the script that is presented, it makes a noble attempt, but it is also still flat. <br /> <br /> The moss is also very reasonable. Her look of concern is always the same, very similar to Keanu, and chemistry is non-existent, although in its physical sights it is very falsely well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo again brought his strange sense of being a proxy program, but he also suffered from the hand of the script. I find him in fact the most interesting person in the group, but instead of development, they make him just an excuse for a huge battlefield. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is more frustrating if you have good expectations, alone, as a movie Independent (which is not how it is assumed to be filmed), it is still terrible. I do not see the matrix deep, but at least I see it as a fun scientific trap containing some interesting ideas, good work, a few ridiculous lines, restricted symbolism and enough quirks to entertain attention. Reloading failed all these charges, and I really hope that W Bros will give us a better experience in the third installment. Granted, I do not have much hope for that after this film.
