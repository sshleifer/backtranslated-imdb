Well, how was I supposed to know that this is the "Lordi Motion Picture" promo? I mean I realized this when this Dinosaur costume appeared and when the main singer appeared I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" to myself ... although I hate that song. The "dark floors" revolve around a young girl with autism who is being infiltrated outside the hospital by her protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that private elevator, are temporarily trapped ... When they arrive on their floor, it is surprising to find that there is no other person around him . The hospital is empty ... except for a variety of monsters that seem to be chasing them for no apparent reason ... running in the lanes and ladders, and all the band members in the heavy metal band encountering their strange shock rock fashion ... There is nothing really unforgettable here, With the exception of bad representation, lack of nonsense / nudity, and a grossly unfair promotional edge, which often reminds me of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, remember that bird? I wish I did not ... I would just recommend avoiding all those Ghost House movies like fungus and not listening to Lordi because they are the GoR band ripoff!
