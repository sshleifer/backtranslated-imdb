A film with very little positive to say about it. <br /> <br /> First, it has no speed and is positively absent in any drama. <br /> <br /> Besides being remarkably slow, The Empty Acre seems to be devoted to using the same stock footage over and over again. I have lost the number of times I saw it "that" at night or that cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has a fundamental flaw in thinking that if the audience does not know what things will sweep rather than just confuse. So with no signs of any problems we suddenly find that marriage is not what it seems to be despite giving the impression that it is okay. We find that Jacob is the worst farmer in the universe because he does not seem to spend time on the farm and seems to have bought land in a useless dungeon. House has a key to the bookstore? There are countless other questions that have been resolved later in the film, later, in fact too late. <br /> <br /> On an acre point. Horror filmmakers note that non-living things by their very nature are not scary ?? And also if it's supposed to be a big canyon, make it as well. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness such as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson ?? the cop) suddenly seems to be accused of everything under the sun simply because it is "manipulated". <br /> <br /> With the full 10 minutes as well as running around the fields looking for the missing child (he crawled from a six month old), the movie descends into a poorly written scene after a badly written scene. Bad bad music does not add an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Bad movies can often be amusing but it's not the The Empty Acre game, which is very bad.
