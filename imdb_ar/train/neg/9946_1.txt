The spoilers are here <br /> <br /> My high school has done everything in their power to try to motivate us to take exams. But the most memorable way they used to bring us to the right state of mind was the guest speaker, who was only the favorite Australian son of kickboxing, Stan The Man, Longinides. The first mistake they made was to give this man a microphone, because he was screaming half the time even though we were sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away. Now, his speech was filled with the usual things "if you failed to prepare, then prepare for failure," but there were different situations where I was doing well. The man stood there before us, preaching how he had done everything for himself and for no one else. He has offered him many deals in the past to give up boxing, but he has not closed his eyes to being awarded the greatest boxer in Australia. He said it was not a sale, he was happy and retired, did not participate in any activity other than Kickboxing? Then he connected his film. Yes, I have heard about it right, his new film has escaped. While he was talking about the subject, he got a woman who came in and carried a sticker that was announced, and then showed this hidden passage for four minutes of this evil film called "Trojan Warrior". (All this before Gorkan Ozcan defeats him in his last fight). <br /> <br /> Stan plays the role of Ajax, the former Special Forces Special Agent for Boxing who is drawn to the Melbourne-free crime scene. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold (well, at least Stan did not get away from it all) to the federalists, and as a result became a fugitive from all aspects of organized crime. Ajax and Theo enter into all the ridiculous situations, ranging from fighting in Kebab's shop to playing as a child to playing in a bondage party. All this is ironic, but if Silverstein was really aiming to produce a reliable film here, this guy should never be handed back a camera. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I've already pumped to see it. I love action movies, even if they are full of movies, especially if they are in my backyard. But what I knew was a terrifying film of the word "go" and continued to do so after the phrase "For the love of God, please stop it!" , The sub-charts were presented and never touched again after they went out in the open. Their characters were cast for no reason at all, and the most popular scenes of fighting that did not yet reflect Stan's actual talent in kickboxing. The cast of actors is a useless veil by anyone remotely known (Dermot Breton, Mark "Chopper" Reid, and Greg Matthews). All the time you sit and play the guessing game about who stands there in the background. Very Bad The film depends heavily on its appearance in the second by former celebrities. Remember those conspiracy holes I told you? It seems that Ajax was bound at some point and was accused of wrongly killing his wife. Now, we hear that Ajax was in special forces by one sentence in the movie WHOLE, then let it go around. This is followed by one sentence that convinces AJAX to help with the same people who were wrongly imprisoned. Then, I get this, in the end, Ajax was revealed that his wife is not already dead, but was sold for prostitution. Do we see it? No. Is Ajax going to find her as soon as he hears this? No. Now this marriage! <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this disturbing childish folly, some websites have described this film as "an intersection between Jackie Chan and Jay Richie?". Did this guy sit and watch Jackie Chan's movie? Chan show more dexterity while unloading than he did Stan ?? , Well nothing! Guy Ritchie is the crime film of Christ, and you compare it to Silverstein. This movie is a mix of "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where are you entitled "Trojan Warrior" all come from? Ajax violent fighting skills like those of the ancient Greek warrior? No. Unite the gangs to find Theo, such as the unification of the Trojan empire? Not because it? Wait it ?? Theo carries the condom around him. Yes, that's right, because THEO is always prepared with rubbers BRAND RUBBER in his pocket, he is a Trojan warrior! <br /> <br /> I had the displeasure of seeing "Trojan Warrior" on a DVD, plus "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Chop Chop, rap song by Mark Chopper Read: Chopper I did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap. The funny thing was the Chopper, which was only shown for 30 seconds and then delivered to these white teenagers from Doncaster, using words like "dis" and "dope" etc in their Australian dialects. Meet people, rap has been developed in the US, leave it there! The video looked like a picture of Channel 31 on ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bullets: There was no real difference between this and the actual film. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing featurette: This was not so bad, considering that it was just 6 or 7 of the different battles that were shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio falling over 15 times in that 3-volume montage minutes). <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that this film contributes to why this country goes to hell when it comes to film, but ... Oh, I did. My advice to anyone reading this is to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of the Trojan Warrior, collect them together and use them to weight the paper, because this is a very bad film.
