You must know that I'm the type of person who watches even the worst movies to the end, often out of curiosity and evil. I watched Leprechaun until the end before I succumbed to the temptation to tear my eyes and seal them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I jumped a hectic jump to the stop button and turned off the rental shop just to put as much distance between me and him as possible.
