Pretty awful but chapel and amusing. It's the same old story (if you lived during the 1980s). Veterinarians in Vietnam fight as friends against injustice in the United States. Meet A-Wish Death Wish, my favorite team! <br /> <br /> Time is on, soldiers are returning home, and years later a friend is having trouble. No, wait - in fact, the friend and his father died in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, was killed by a horrifying (very pointy) meat dealer while trying to defend his father's small shop from the local "protection" gang, despite being a wheelchair bound by the war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Serge, the old air unit commander from Vietnam, when Sarg attends to attend the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the sharp wheel is rising with grease, and the old gang is rising to the city. You can pretty much imagine the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drove me crazy is that Sarg continues to move his men around planning, and how they are really good at what they do when planning for the future. But Joy would not have put him in a wheelchair in Vietnam in the first place if unity had not been in place! Then when things go well in the city while fighting with gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely exceeded their plan and tried to nudge the gang without everyone present. PHH !!!! I raise my hand in disgust. Foolishness! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all the current members of the unit make sure that the heroin experience they take from the gang is to make sure it is real. everyone of them. They are .... <br /> <br /> What will you do? Keep watching, I guess. The film is not too terrible to watch, but it's a tease film. There are all these climax moments when nothing actually ends. The most exciting things that happen are those in the beginning of the film - Explosives in Vietnam, Death Air Battle, and the gang that brutally kick off the side-by-side Dibba (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I think my main beef with this film is that I'm frustrated. Even the confusing sub-points with the "mysterious assistants" and their multi-purpose motives were not enough to save them in the end. But someday maybe everything will come well and they will make a supplement. Hahaha !!!
