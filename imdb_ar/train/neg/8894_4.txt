This film is a sound embodiment, a straight 11/10 on the phoniness scale. The fad accents, as well as the tightness of the spandex sweaty cardigan pants are just stunning. Yankees, although real Scotland may be equally colorful, if you do not go there, do not expect to give you much of a "dance" controversial opportunity with the locals. Also, do not try to influence the local opinion through the art of beautiful modern dance. <br /> <br /> There are a few dance scenes for dance and dance, but the plot is far from sin, and dialogue is often very weak. I also doubt whether anyone wants to be stuck in an 18th century Scottish village in Bondiaux instead of gay in New York City. Perhaps this was not such a great sacrifice for the priest to leave the Brig, perhaps he was just trying to get the hell out of this mold. <br /> <br /> Watch it for an alternative view of reality. Christopher Stride's show in Scotland will look like LSD. Other than that I would recommend it only to Hollywood musical enthusiasts.
