Each of the 1930s is dated, but if you're only going to see John Ford's films, it will look more dated than if you were watching other films. The Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always someone selling nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always over-emphasis of some bad heavy. The scripts are always bad, embarrassing and clear. This is no exception. It's just a fairly lovable organ to convey feelings. The feeling is that all this has happened. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not make me appreciate Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the full-fledged population described here. Ford went to make decent films. This is too dated to be anything but bad. It's a totally wrong feeling. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda has a strange fake nose. No one from Illinois can pronounce "S" or "Shonuff".
