I hired this movie to see what might have been a bloody film that we never stopped and got this emotional and extremely cheap movie that makes the Kickboxer look like Die Hard. If Lou and Rob are in Vietnam, when Lou Rob is rescued from the Joke, he is easily shot in the head, which is one of the worst effects ever. Vietnam scenes are shot in the backyard of someone, I swear! If now he had a brain injury and a rab with him lives together and has a bar. Super homogeneous. If he is convinced of fighting in a cage for money and is still in a killing spree to return him. There are no good fighting scenes at all, and punches are two inches from the person. Characters characters change within seconds. One person is bad and the next scene is good. The acting is appalling, and the music is an overly emotional Frank Stallone song that will make you sick. I hated this film.
