I found the speed to be glacial and the original story blown way out of the content. My wife slept mostly and did not try to wake her up because I felt she did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson enter the house and are therefore likely to be caught, it is unclear how all their entry and burglary tools could be hidden so quickly. It is also unclear how to lock the door of the study, which prevents the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> The thing that finally puzzled me was when there was a luster in the eye of the broken statute. I have no idea what he was supposed to represent.
