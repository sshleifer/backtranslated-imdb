I got a Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was fantastic in American Gothic) but unfortunately she did not have a big role in this film. It starts OK and moves at a good pace ... but in the end you begin to get something boring and a bit boring. This does not mean that this film is boring, but it is very average and nothing wonderful. I did not like the "assumption" side of it and there were no decent gorges. In addition to that the "main" story was very confusing and the end was meaningless at all. However, I liked the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she avenged her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend Mirror Mirror to horror lovers - it's nothing to enjoy.
