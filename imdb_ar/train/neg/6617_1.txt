It really shows that the hype is not all. He appears before and is a representative of crappy abhishek and only gets films because of his father and wife. Amitabh is always as solid. Ajay Devgan as always is angry and useless and the new man is a joke. The leading lady is a waste of a representative. This pathetic film of such a revered director is from this big industry. With films like this, I've reduced the number of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has made very crazy films for some time. Time to get different actors. Hrithik one? Bollywood needs Madry and Kajol. Every other leading lady wants to be half naked. Pffffft.
