I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This special film was missing, and I feel it will be more effective with a plot. It was made worse by his perpetual appearance; I was anxious to end up in the end. However, I noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; I felt like four hours. There was not only a plot, but the film lacked a noticeable struggle. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but I was saying it was so I saw "fasting and angry". So, do not think that my review is from someone who only needs to work. I actually hate most motion movies today; it's just that this movie is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this film. However, the scenery and the costumes were nice.
