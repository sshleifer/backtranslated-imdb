I asked for the film from Korea because I was an addict and I was interested in seeing how it was shown. <br /> <br /> After seeing him I can say that I am ashamed to own any part of him. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone involved in making this satirical "comedy" British. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the film is predictable, tedious, boring and monotonous. It is worth it to the extent that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in a belief. Until you actually see the film, it's hard to imagine how romantic comedy can be romantic and non-comic. In a scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing SSA when he scans. I'll post details about that in the "Laps" section. <br /> <br /> On the top side, filled with emotions (disappointment, anger and embarrassment?)
