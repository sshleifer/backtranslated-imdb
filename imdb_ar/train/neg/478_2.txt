The competition for the worst Warner Bros. film by Chris Francis Hardy. I've only seen eight of them, but the culprit across Broadway is the worst yet. The best thing is that it is short. Oh, and the robes of Kelly O'Reilly (of course) are fine. Photographing James Wong Hao is not. Kai Francis looks all over the face and is much less attractive than you usually do. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know very well, is a "dutiful" dancer who looks almost like a daisy. The final shot - Kai Francis and her child (When did the child learn that Kai Francis was her mother?) Did she leave? Walking on a dirt road toward a prison painted in foggy lines at an audio theater point is ridiculous. The whole film is so cheap, so unreasonable and indifferent that it makes him sickly cynical by all who made it: Warner Bros. dumped the garbage on children who, according to their derisive Warner Bros. estimate, did not get the trash.
