(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with very low expectations, and I can sadly tell you that the film barely lives up to them. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked to see Jean "Luffy" Carlson on the big screen again, the writers should have realized early in the process of scriptwriting that seven people fall into the water, are not original or funny. The story is extremely high and jokes are used and predictable, those that are not just boring. I smiled three times throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The Swedish findus products are unintentionally (unintended), so why not just a big sign saying, "Findus has done it!". <br /> <br /> No need to watch GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 in the cinema or on the DVD, just wait for it to be broadcast on the TV, and it will not take long.
