It was so amateurish that I did not believe what I was watching. Filmed on video! Not a movie! I have not seen anything like this since the early 1970s, when late-night networks screened a film called "The Freaks of Terror" weekly in Video .... It looks like a bad soap opera, and this pays her a compliment. Some actors give it a better shot. Michael Des Bares agrees with what he is given, which is to act as a sex addiction out of control. I can not say it's good to see them. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski While the therapist sits on a chair for almost all the film, with very little variation in the camera angles. I can not mistake her for someone else's bad blockage, but she never believes in her role. The voice of her little girl works against her here. I consider myself an admirer of Nastassja Kinski. It is without a doubt strange and abnormal, but it is beyond its scope. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul suffers from severe dehydration. Each line provided is with three exclamation points. Someone must direct her to yell at all costs. Why does Michael Des Bares want to have sex with such an angry frenzy? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette as a beloved wife comes in fine, and probably the most sincere. But that does not mean much. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst film I've seen in years.
