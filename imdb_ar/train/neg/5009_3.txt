This was probably the worst film I've ever seen. The plot was not very meaningful and the acting was awful. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, and I think she's usually a fantastic actress, and I can not imagine why she decided to do that. Her character, Piper, is drunk in almost the entire film, except for the opening scene. On the plus side, there were many points in the film where the acting was so bad, I really laughed out loud. However, I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Its length is only 80 minutes, but this will only take 80 minutes of your life.
