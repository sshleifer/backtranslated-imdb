I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented a DVD disc from Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I will not say who ..! (That's what's left under the rolls ..) But I have to admit, it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savigny? This man is arrested .. But it is a shame that he was not in the film for a long time .. What lacks the film is the idea, script, sound, etc. It may sound like a good movie .. But it was not fun .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad because my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this .. I was disappointed. Anyway, excellent for me ..! Tea cup is not me! 0 out of 10!
