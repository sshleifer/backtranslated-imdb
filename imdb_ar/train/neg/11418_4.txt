Joel Schumacher runs the script he co-authored and has a group of Georgetown graduates who face adult life situations. The story line is a mess, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of lost talent and time here. The most impressive cast of the film. Prominent among them are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Nelson Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Eli Chidi and Mary Wenningham. Most notably McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is very obnoxious. Coming of age is not so easy.
