I'm not a fan of Freddie Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and he has another nightmare in Elm Street. I think Robert is a very good actor. No one plays the role of Freddie Krueger better than he is, but, no crime Robert, sucked this movie. The work is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddie Krueger is the only part of the crew that is worth watching sometimes. Friday 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But this is not one of those films. The original was good, the second in my opinion was the best, the third was fine but I did not see others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake you made by watching this piece of nonsense.
