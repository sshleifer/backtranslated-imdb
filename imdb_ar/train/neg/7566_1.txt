Before this release, Neil Labot had this to say about the original version of 1973: "Surprisingly, many people say it's their favorite music, I'm impressed, come on! You may not like the new track, but if that's your favorite sound, I do not know if I want to love my film. "Neil, word. You may want to sit down for this, too, says Lord Summersl. The shocks are better absorbed with the knees flexed. See, Neil, the original thing, is that the soundtrack of Paul Giovanni is one of the most famous things in it. The filmmakers consider themselves a virtual musician. Along with Richard, Danny Thompson, and Bert Janach, the launch of the new popular wave began in the 1970s. Undermining it is closer to imagining the jaws without John Williams. Or the story of friends Holly without friends Holly. The result is one of the most spectacularly up-to-date version of the classic British cult since the movie "Get Carter" by Sala Stallone. <br /> <br /> It seems that the original left Nicholas Cage "turbulent for almost two weeks." It is very disturbing, during the window of those two weeks, that he put forward the idea of ​​re-imagining one of the most accurate films about the interfaith conflict ever devised by a director and previously known for portraying quite inadequate male chauvinism. It's like a lobby game: what would you get if Sam Beckenba played Bambi? Or Gaspar "irrevocable" intention to reshape love, in fact? (In fact, I would quite like to see it). Unfortunately, someone took this game seriously: All LaBute did it, ripping out the original courage while worrying about his intense sexual warfare concerns. <br /> <br /> After failing to rescue a young girl and her mother from a fatal car accident, Cage whirlpool patrols the highway in a medical tower. He then receives a letter from his former fiancée, Willow Woodward (who is known as the "name greeting"), and now lives in Somersel Island's private community. This extra 'stands for' unnecessary '? He wants Edward to help locate his missing daughter Rowan. <br /> <br /> It is clear that summer is a woman-dominated structure and is seen as a refuge for immigrant and refugee women from Salem's witchcraft experiments. Here, mothers note the old ways, and a few male breeds are close to mute. It's like Lilith Fair on a large scale. Export main summer is honey ?? A symbolic and literal headache for Edward, because he suffers from allergies to bees. "Beekeepers!" Edward cries. "They seem to be everywhere in this island!" Well, maybe that's because Summersisle's main export is honey. <br /> <br /> While conducting his investigations, Edward hears a rite coming from Mayday called "Time of Death and Birth". Discovers the failure of the previous year's crop; almost dies from bee stings. And finally comes to a conclusion (a conclusion that can not be clearer if the local population has drawn a calendar of events on his hands) that Rowan will be burned alive in pagan rites to ensure abundant harvest. He also meets with the Queen of Bees in the cell, sister Somersel (Borstein), who has her own plans, which include a man named Khosair: "The drones must die." <br /> <br /> First, the good news: Any fears Cage may be flown from Wicker Man's fiery wrists at the last minute by a fleet of CIA black helicopters that can rest: the toast. This is about it for good news. "This is the story that I have carefully written," they see with ironic irony. Although retaining the hypothesis of the cat and the basic mouse (and credits in print), the remaining themes of the original scorched earth policy. <br /> <br /> It was important to imagine the original Schaffer scenario that his Christian way, according to the ritual, came to an island of his own free will? More importantly, he was a virgin. Full sacrifice. In shortening sexual matters, rather than the religious struggle for power, LaBute offers the strangest of qualifiers to sacrifice harvest. By the time Cage succeeded, he had the bait, and frankly did not care less about him. <br /> <br /> The Cage is one of the worst things in this; donkey, donkey, ?? arsewit whose tongue seems a little bigger than his mouth. "Goddamit" complains after being cheered by the drenched Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who set the morning alarm clock half an hour early. One hopes that his frequent adoption of the pill is what led him to this situation ?? Tired tired, then filled with preppy, arrogant Hem. If so, it is a wonderful picture of a non-discriminating intelligence and antidepressant. If it's not ?? Do not bear to think. As a willow, Bihan's horrible dish is also appalling, offering her lines as if she were in competition with Cage for the most volatile birth. While Burstyn completely lacks mercurial risk to persuade. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Each item make a great original? The detailed images were replaced by a love for popular customs, the creative result, and the dialogue (Lord Summersl majestic "You did it beautifully!" In less attractive terms, "I did it perfectly!" The arrogant "Battle of the Sexes" The Custer's Sister Beech is one of the most embarrassing episodes; the young men who are helpless will hunt for how they finally got the Hippie's bold hicks what was bad, Hyuk Hyuk. <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> See the closing coca that the entire corrupt mess collapses under the weight of the cliches of the genus: in a bar, running Two players from two Samaritan communities on a beach vacation hunt Sidon as a new martyr, and at the moment of their successful capture, half expect the women to turn around and give an exaggerated voice and thumbs to the camera. <br /> <br /> There is something else: Credit watchers are keen that films that contain a large number of unusually large producers (ie up to 10) tend to be uncensored.Wickerman has 18 products in total.
