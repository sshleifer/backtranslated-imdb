There are those bad movies that are funny, then there are those movies that scream "I want to be back an hour and a half of my life" ... that's what it is pretty much. <br /> <br /> The dean of Cain tries to be a representative but he fails. The sfx is really bad (repetitive scenes and rocks that look like falling paper) and fake plastic guns that flash the torches on it ... The split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is terrible. <br /> <br /> You can not even use this movie as one of these artists at night, it's very bad <br /> <br /> If I can get negative ratings,
