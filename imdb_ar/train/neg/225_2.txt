The spoiler: The little lover "Good" was kicked out by "Kate" (Andy McDowell) because she mistakenly believes that "Jed" is having an affair with one of her girlfriends. Kate thought they had caught them in a blaze. Kate threw the Jade shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, then sits halfway to put his shoes on. He then runs over ("Crush", one meaning of the title) by truck. And die. <br /> <br /> "Then he is run over by a truck." Can you imagine that the scriptwriter actually offers text using this graphic element? Until then, it's a comedy that intends to be a butcher, but lacks anything real. All except good annoying. Then they kill the good and the grief of all, until the end where the girls learn to love each other and be supportive, rather than destroy. I give it 2 LAV.
