This is a great step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original. This sequence is hardly as enjoyable as the first part, but it takes a long time to develop the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing in this series, but his judgment has been diluted in this entry. All offers are adequate, but this time, script script. The only routine work and the plot is mildly interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughs to stay entertained during the movie "Converts". Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and so, this film can be seen at best.
