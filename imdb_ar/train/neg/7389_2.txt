I can buy or watch every movie at least Seagall. I came out with a few good movies and then descended into bad stories, bad work in the camera and personality, almost lost me. A few films ago remember how to make a film fit. Now he has forgotten again. This movie is dangerously dark (at any level you care about). There are many slanted and modern pieces that are going on here without any clear purpose unless it is a warning against the army. <br /> <br /> Seagall may have a back-up position for many of his sights because it was often too dark to see and vote for someone else who was using most of the time. Sadly, the only interesting person is the bad guy who killed his guard to escape the arrest and then proceeded to provoke chaos everywhere. Well, when do we put an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner? Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. There are lots of loopholes if you love that king. It seemed to me that the bad guys had torn the same wound every time. I am happy because they did not shed blood from their unfortunate victims. I'm bringing you back to my summary. Basically, it's a horror movie disguised as action film
