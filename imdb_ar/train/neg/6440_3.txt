This was one of the worst WrestleMania I've ever seen. It just did not stand out at all, really. I thought the game would be good, but it seems that every game is short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit for MBV is one of the best games. Download Benoit. I did not think MVP was fantastic, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Keane v. Khali Wau, these two people do not mix. Or perhaps Cali and anyone else alive are not mingling. Awesome match. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley is not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was passionate about this game, so I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Just a disappointment, for many people in the ring at the same time. It was not. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. Not very impressive, but not the worst at night. <br /> <br /> Batista against the Undertaker This was probably the best game of the night. Very nice too to see something good to change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel that this match deserves to be recent. People make Batista's case against the Undertaker, but this match was good. I'm tired of seeing Cena win every game. It gets a little old. Now, I must say, I feel that this match is the best at night, but I'm very impressed with Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Maybe Batista against Tucker is better, but I biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games at night and most of the other things really came.
