Oh God, where do you start ...... bad behavior ... the characters you do not care about ... Are they American or British ... They seem to think they are in America, because this is the other place a huge forest in the central regions. .. <br /> <br /> One big mistake ... They drive all night through this forest ... unless they were wandering around in Scotland this morning .. when a walking man knocks a poor woman .... <br /> <br /> They do not work with mobile phones .. what do they do ... split of course, make it easier to be picked up ... so the three are looking for a home that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two are left behind to "care" the unconscious woman ... What they do, instead of making them comfortable, covering their heads, covering them or even moving them away from the booming road, leaves them lying on the hard road as they go and set fire 100 yards away. . <br /> <br /> On the horny angels that are supposed to be the kind of human being wanted so much that they were expelled from heaven to live among us ... What are they doing? Getting sexual relations with any man they face? ......... do not bite big pieces of them and take their heads ... I think they miss the point ... <br /> These are not wonderful ex-ex-Angels they cannabalistic vampires ... As Tom Savigny saying how beautiful and beautiful breathing .... Well those girls have good bodies but nothing special in the facial section. The leading role was more beautiful than those who call the sirens irresistible ... <br /> <br /> Waste of a trash film worth Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
