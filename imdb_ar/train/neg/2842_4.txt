I'm in awe! Wow, prepare to be blown away by the exotic ways of ninja. Watch them rise, crawl on the floor (on their backs or in the stomach) like the larva, fly in the sky, climb buildings, hide and sprout from trees, throw ninja stars out of the blue welcome mats, disappear in smoke bombs, Using their blades and quickly sneaking or running on her toes. What a sight! I can really go on with the many traditional works, but I'll stay here all day. We should not forget that we see legendary Chuck Connors from time to time, watching him send some ninja with his rifle easily. Any row! What a poking! In any case, the very cheap "Sakura Killers" is a bit stupid, but the amazing ninja fun is that the fanatics of this kind are the only ones who will get anything from this heinous class B disaster. <br /> <br /> A very important video clip has been stolen by two ninja. Two Americans were sent to Japan by Colonel (Chuck Connors) to retrieve him. <br /> <br /> Open the setting feature well. Prepare for laughter! Then it slows down, but soon the ninja ninja, the two leading ninja players, learn to get steam because they break fashion and run away after the stolen beta tape, which has a very important formula. This is when the swift movement comes violently and the matrimonial aerobic arts to play. It's not too bad (like camouflage and dark presentations). The final climatic confrontation was very well done. <br /> <br /> In slow expansions, Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nichols) are looking into this issue, exchanging non-intellectual conversations and facing some minor problems. What made me laugh was how the ninja was put off by their courage and identity. Were they supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ("The Effects (1989)") is doing something serious and playing for it. It focuses on on-screen activities around Taiwan's fascinating locations. The result is chintzy order.
