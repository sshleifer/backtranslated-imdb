dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to "start" ... then I waited for it to recover itself ... and when it did not, I just sat there, stifled: 1) this may be bad, and 2) I had just wasted a few hours on just stupid. I had faith that Drew could not have made this movie bad ... and boy, I lost my faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the film was badly written, misbehavior, and poorly designed! I can not believe a text that got this bad funding! She had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word "concept" so big that this film could not qualify for it!) And it was still a great place! It's just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it was not the worst, I am puzzled! Because believe me, if it gets worse, I cut off my wrists before you finish it!
