My friend and I were shocked by how bad this film was. After 15 minutes, we had called it "Finish" except we were very curious to see if it was possible to recover the movie itself. That did not happen. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise given to this film. The writing was awful and Muslim by some of the worst behaviors I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The thing I was particularly excited about about this film was that often when people talked to each other there was an abnormal pause between the lines. I understand the use of pause to create a sense of embarrassment (as in happiness). This was not the kind of stop - it was just a bad guide. This movie may actually be better with translation, and perhaps the overseas market is the best in this film, because then this strange dialogue and bad behavior will not be noticed. <br /> <br /> In general, I like these kinds of little movies, "The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing," but this film has failed so many levels that I consider it one of the worst films I have seen in the past few years Past.
