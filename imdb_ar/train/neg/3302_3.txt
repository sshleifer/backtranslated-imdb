Over the past few years, Swedish motion films have evolved into something that imitates powerful American motion films such as Hit, but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is clear that they are trying hard to produce a wonderful and difficult film. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue seems artificial and the representation is very bad, especially from the main actress. The film tries to paint armed robbers like the army, without feeling remorse at all, an accomplice who has lost entirely the problems of the past but at the same time behaves in a perfectly rational manner. This did not work well. <br /> <br /> The pattern of blackened images is no longer new, but it does not work well in this picture. Only very few scenes look really good. The sound is quite strange and it seems that a lot of actual dialogue is recorded after that. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stephane Sock, although not a convincing picture of the leader SWAT team, he has some really funny lines. Also, the music is very good.
