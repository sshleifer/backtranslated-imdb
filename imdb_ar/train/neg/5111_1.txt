I used to be an enthusiastic competitor until I personally spent many hours helping build a house for the white family, just because I was sick to see the house a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscape was removed, the magnificent rocky pavement and the front fountain were removed. All pine and pecan trees were cut in the foreground and the sprinkler system was removed. It now seems like a disaster zone. They do not live there anymore ... They live "in the city" and only go out for the weekend. I am pleased to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma have donated to these people and to see the result. The story we all saw on television was not quite the truth ... you do not believe everything you see and hear.
