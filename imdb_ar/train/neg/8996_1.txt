In the future of 1985, a government commission chaired by Howard Hessman will hold hearings on the first uncensored network on television. They are sample of programming, which play as a series of plays. I can label good movies "comic play" on the one hand, not using my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon," "Kentucky Fried Movie," "The Meaning of Life," and "Video by Mike Mundo." Notice how I did not mention "tunnel vision"? The reason for this is that this "film" is death in cinematic form. Nothing funny comics even remotely, or even a little clever. It takes a lot of uncertainty on the part of the filmmakers not to laugh at me. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn Front
