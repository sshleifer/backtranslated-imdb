A drama about a gay model (Margaux Hemingway) who was raped by an unbalanced eccentric musician (Chris Sarandon) - introduced by her younger sister (played by her real sister Mariel), to whom the music teacher works. While the central court movement is paying attention - largely thanks to Anne Bancroft's lead performance as a lawyer in Hemingway - the film is often very bright, but also unconvincing: The jury takes the musician side ostensibly because of "nature" (B) did not offer any resistance to her presumed assailants when her sister arrived at the apartment and saw the couple inadvertently in bed. What and *** ?! It was clearly constrained - what resistance could it offer in real terms? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film - which includes Sarandon's rape of the sister, who is intrigued by IRREVERSIBLE (2002) by way of a tunnel - is rather intriguing: Mariel's character should have been better than the trust in Sarandon after he did But Margo herself foolishly retrieves the line of action that indirectly leads to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The climax - in which Sarandon gets his fair sweets, with Margaux suddenly turning into a trick that does not know fear and fear - is, however, to satisfy the crowd in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); by the way, the Italian film pole was everywhere Dino de Laurentis behind both films . <br /> <br /> It is worth noting how the life of my sister Hemingway has turned into very different roles (this was the first film in both): Margaux's career never took a standstill (despite its undeniably good appearance and participation) Marilyn will soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen Manhattan (1979). Interestingly, she will play herself a glamorous victim of raging violence when she describes the real life role of Dorothy Dorothy Stratton in the 1983 star Bob Voss. With the added pressure of a pair of failed marriages, Margo resorts to alcohol and ultimately dies Drug overdose in 1996; Hemingway was a terrible family, and has a history of suicide - especially very sisters, the famous author Ernest, who died of his wounds sustained in 1961.
