Forwarders - Be Careful - <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that as soon as Harry recognizes the identities of the three predators - with relative ease - he continues to meet their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife's kidnapping, he decided to plug his classic car until it explodes (with the money in it), which makes us take a very long leap of logic. <br /> <br /> Well, so he wanted to keep his relationship with Cini out of sight because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. I can see this, but why is not someone hired to slap these bulls around a bit, or even kill them once you determine that there is no real evidence of blackmail (for example, Cini's body?) This was an interesting film for the first 2/3 from him. After that, it's a kind of breakdown.
