The film is basically the story of the return of a Russian whore to her native village to attend the funeral of a sister / girlfriend. There are a few other story lines that may actually be more interesting than those that have been taken, but they have not been fully explored. The essence of the film is the funeral, wake-up and subsequent debate about the future of a community of friends who make puppets and sell them to buy vodka but now lack the artist who made the dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is not edited. The prostitute's journey from town to village is an endless train journey and rustling in the mud. Perhaps we should be impressed by the enormity of the Russian scene. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one man, the wife of the dead girl. The continuation of the puppet act is a problem for all concerned and seems ultimately impossible. Most of the film is filmed with a hand-held camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western audiences is that translations do not include the songs and lives of friends. Do not go to this movie unless you speak fluent Russian.
