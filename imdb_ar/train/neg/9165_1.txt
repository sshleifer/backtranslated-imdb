There are no spoilers in this review because everything has already been shown in the movie clip. I try to be balanced in my assessment because I strongly support local films, but I can only support the opposite reaction against this film. It's slow, dull and bordering meaninglessly. Even "gentle and reliable moments" are instantly undermined by painful cliches and bad behavior. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only acceptable in this film. The director seemed to be trying to make melodramatic soap, then he was deported and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years should come with a RA rating (very bad rating) but did not change my faith in local movies. More good films will come, as long as no such films are produced.
