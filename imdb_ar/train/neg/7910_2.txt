I saw most of the "Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and I had to get out of the theater because of the feelings of nausea. I've seen Bollywood movies, and seen a satire from Bollywood movies. This film could not identify the film he wanted to be, so he ended up laughing at himself. <br /> <br /> It appears to have been freely copied from movies such as Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling a dirty, lazy job. How can Bollywood get rid of its design to stick to excessive scripts? Who can show millions of real and wonderful stories that undoubtedly exist and turn into a billion people? The extra intelligent driver, the cow on the street, the free scenes of foreign sites, the stale scenes in the streets of Mumbai, are all there. All possible clich√©s have been included in India honestly. It is therefore unpredictably predictable. Ugh!!! The performances are weak in all areas except Neha Dubey, talented and beautiful. One wonders why she chose such a project.
