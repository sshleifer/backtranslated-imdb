Alone In The Dark is a single BAD movie associated with Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish this was all I was saying but of course, IMDb states the number of words and all that. <br /> <br /> I'm in two decades about what kind of bad movies is kind of bad movies. Low-budget Drake like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a major budget drawback such as Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see films like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director has no clue. Movies like this happen because the director is stupid, he makes money, he simply does not care about his audience. <br /> <br /> It will be even more shocking when you think that Uwe Boll (the mastermind behind this already dreaded nonsense has some real trash under his belt) created something that happens only once in the Blue Moon. Horror film is really very bad. All about it is chaos. Cheesy CGI, a bad plot, a random random camera cut and a horrible soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible movie that no one should ever see. Wu Hoo! Review more. Give me a favor, open in 2006, and I hope I will not talk about this again. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie.
