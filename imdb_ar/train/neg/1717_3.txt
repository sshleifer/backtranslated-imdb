Here we have two misunderstood children who have never had the chance to face a harsh and poverty-ridden existence: Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because it was sometimes trivial. Earnest! According to this folly, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of Missouri that she learned was a mental killer by her loving boyfriend who did not really want to hurt anyone .... He wanted things without putting too much energy into them. Behaved badly, filmed badly, an incredible dialogue, the use of unreal weapons, Gore who looked like the jelly of grapes more than the real thing. Avoid this bilgewater. I was astonished. -5 stars.
