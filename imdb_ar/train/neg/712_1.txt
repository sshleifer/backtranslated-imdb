When I started watching this movie, I saw the dude of Buffy and Xander, and I figured how cute he was still earning his power in the movies. Now I can stand with a strange film, because it is a good dose of exotic films, for example, David Lynch movies, double peaks, lost highway, etc. But that made me cynically remember the crazy sites about there about the conspiracy theory that made no sense at all. I mean, what are the Nazi people who conspire with America to make an unholy triad of the forces of evil? They were surprised that they did not mention the boned land in this film with Hitler's flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you have 60 grams of heroine with this movie, it makes sense somewhat, but seriously do not overlook drugs like I do not overlook this film. It must be burned, torn and forgotten completely and Mr. Zander may get another job in acting. It was not his behavior, it was so good, but the script had no meaning. Sorry.
