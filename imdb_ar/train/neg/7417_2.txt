This movie is very bad - dialogues, story, actresses and actresses - everything! - It's hard to imagine that we will be seeing a worse film this year or in the years to come. The "brother of love" (located in Australia among Italian immigrants) has only shallow cliches about Italian culture, and tells us that even Italians from Italy and Italy speak English in the film. The message of the film - ugly people must marry ugly people, beautiful people to marry beautiful people - is a really annoying message. Giovanni Ribesi is very good in films like "Suburban" or "Lost in Translation," but his false Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Garbage can also be garbage!
