The climb is actually a step forward in terms of what the original film was in the story and special effects. Jason Scott Lee is as good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, it was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Faraway Dracula's body is stolen from the slab. Diane Neil is as good as a woman who steals Dracula's body in order to find a treat for her deceased friend, and Steven Billington is as wonderful as Dracula himself. Better performance than Gerard Butler made the count in the original film. Roy Cheddar tries the rest of the actors in this film and does a good job as a mentor for Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and it's a good start. It is up to the air whether the last film will close the serial well.
