This film contains a hypothesis that is difficult to swallow, even by such standards. We are asked to accept not only that the record that was played back could bring a dead man back to life, but the record also contains hidden messages specifically addressed to one child, when the singer has no connection to the boy when he is alive, and of course there is no way To find out from the hands of the ultimate record. Anyway, the movie was fun for a while, but in the end it was an oddity and uselessness prevailed. If they were really trying to create a new horror icon like Freddy, they were far away: the villain here has no character, no motive, no diversity. (* 1/2)
