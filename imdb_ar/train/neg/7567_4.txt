Young-goon is a girl with a history of mental illness. She ended up in a mental institution after she began to believe that she was in fact a cyborg. At the foundation you meet Park Il-sun, the young man who connects her. <br /> <br /> If you read this, it is likely that you already know how Chan Walk Park is talented. But "I'm Cyborg ..." is a big departure from a familiar and strong area (unfortunately). I am a big fan of any film or story trying to do something different. God knows that we are all exposed to enough heat in our local cinemas. The main point of the film I want to say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create characters that care about it. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the weirdest things I have seen in years ... but strange is not enough. There is no heart to the film ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All characters try to understand their own problems, but Park Chan-wook himself is proving to be the most puzzled of them all.
