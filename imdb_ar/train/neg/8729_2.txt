This is a sexy film with a good concept, good representation, good photography and good intentions everywhere, but it is chaotic and disjointed in implementation. <br /> <br /> Garcia starring John Berlin, a forensic investigator in Los Angeles, moved to a small town in California at the request of a friend of his for the force there. He soon participates in the investigation into an unresolved murder, leading to his theory of a serial killer that no one else believes. The victim is known to be blind, leading to a love story with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Although there is essentially a dramatic story, there were a lot of quantum leaps and holes in the plot where I found myself wondering, "How the hell did we wind up here?" or "How did we find this?" I found it confusing and disjointed, despite good behavior, etc. John Malkovich had a small role in the end as one of the FBI's investigating outside to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
