The film is very weak, mainly due to the poor story, but also about the bad representation in the case of Robert Downey Jr., the irrational behavior of many characters. If you are someone who likes to turn off your mind and watch a movie simply about creativity or acting standards, you might like this movie. Personally I can not do that with drama and I found this elusive. <br /> <br /> I am particularly disturbed when the main character, who is supposed to be a smart person, constantly acts like a complete idiot. In this film, if the main character acts in the way a person usually behaves in these situations, there will be no film. <br /> <br /> The very first unlikely action is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves for a party and happens with a girl, Malory Dos, played by Ambith Davids, who screams that her car has been stolen. They stand in a tropical rainstorm while deceived and accepted to his home. <br /> <br /> Tell him about her strange father who belongs to some sort of alien community and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated cottage in the poorest part of town, they notice that her car is in the corridor. As the lights of the house are lit and some things in the house have crashed. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, they are strange (look like a vagrant, take off his clothes in front of him until you become completely naked? Also, the strange father, the house wreck - everything had to tell Magruder, "Hey, this is strange to me, I've come out of here!" But not Magruder, slept with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, dealing with the cause of her father's attempt to commit. All screams are set! <br /> <br /> Then, being the top - a former lawyer, he, arriving late to the office wearing the same shirt that he carried the night before (the fact that all the women in the office notice). Is a successful lawyer likely to act like a 16-year-old lawyer? Magruder angered the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that the father intimidates them, the police ignore him, and I think there is a deceptive help. Absolutely - not likely! <br /> <br /> It's very unlikely.
