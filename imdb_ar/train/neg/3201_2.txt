Joe Don Becker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... He was fine in Goldeneye and made a good film of Bond in The Living Daylights and appeared in various other films. One thing he can not do is carry a film as a leader, in the very bad revenge film that was shown in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so the killer's brother is killed and the killer is escorted to Italy, but some men cause the plane to fly in Malta and the murderer flees. Watching the rest of the movie Joe without chasing the killer here and there, Joe is subjected to without being arrested several times, tortured Joe without torture bartendar and is subject to interruptions and so on. The film is very bad and you will not find yourself attracting the characters of Joe Don. You'll be amazed at the number of times Joe is without the hero in one fell swoop and how incompetent he is. The top of the film comes when Joe chases the murderer all over Malta with the murderer in a priest's robe and then catches boats and chases them all over Malta. This film also features one of the worst closing lines to finish a movie at all.
