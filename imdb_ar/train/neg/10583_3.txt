I'm sorry to say this, but acting in this film is terrible. The dialogue seems to be reading the lines for the first time ever. Maybe I got a copy of "Dress rehearsal" by mistake. The manager uses excessive slow motion through special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is well written, and the sequence of fighting is better than I have seen in many motion movies. Battles look very real. But all this happens as lead actors repeatedly escape miraculously from incredible amounts of empty machine-gun fire, grenades, mortars and bazookas. Sure, the enemy soldiers are the worst shots I have ever seen, especially when they have the truck in their eyes from about 30 yards, and every large bazooka shot at least 50 feet away. Those bazookas need serious calibration of sites.
