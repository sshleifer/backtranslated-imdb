... or, more accurately, so bad that you will spend time in your life laughing at your ass when you see it! James Sparadate's Deathstalker 1983 is certainly one of the most horrendous productions brought by the Sword & Sorcery subtype, but it is very exciting. Terrible representation, pure nonsense plot, and photographic effects can not be more amateurish. But it is the bad behavior, the effects of cheating and the many mistakes that make this film very joyous. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Death Hill is a very powerful and gorgeous warrior. One day, it costs a good witch to unify the three forces of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a cup, to liberate the country from its savage ruler, the evil and enchanting king of Manar. Getting the sword is very easy, but the mascot and cup are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king arranged a tournament in which the most skilled warriors in the province competed to death. The winner is to take the king's place. Of course, the king does not want anyone to replace him, so he has plans to kill the winner (instead of not arranging the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not only to get the three powers of creation, but also to save the daughter of the old good king (Barbie Benton) from the claws of Evil Manchar. Luckily, he is not bored and is on his way to the tournament, allowing him to climb up the elegant fight Kayra (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... <br /> <br /> The movie contains many incredibly wonderful things, stupid and funny scenes . Some favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> Deathstalker cuts off a bad man's head with his sword. The head that falls, however, is not the head of that man. The fallen head is carrying a red goatee, while the man whose head is Deathstalker has dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of Warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson), first appeared in a black robe, hiding her face and body. The comedian's companion Judith (Richard Bruker) fights her, and during the sword fights her clothes (which are obviously under her chest), revealing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see for Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deadstocker must fight in the tournament, is a giant man with a man's body and his head of a pig. <br /> <br /> Eiffel Monkar has an ugly little creature locked in a box. It feeds those small human creatures with fingers and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other funny, funny and wonderful scenes. The representation is terrible but Barbie Benton and the expatriate Lana Clarkson were adorable, and although I described the film as "unintentionally funny," I sometimes had the impression that some actors were quite aware of the film's magnificence. There is a fair amount of unfairness, and a lot of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly terrible film, but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have a time of their lives!
