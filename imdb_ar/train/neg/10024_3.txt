The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - does not sell "style" only. I think Tashan when translated means style. Second, if you are determined to sell, this does not prevent you from getting a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that can be enough with a better way out. But it is not a spot. For example, the three - Saif, Karina and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setting is not used correctly. There could have been a better mix of their novels. The sequence of actions is from the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the film is appalling. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept through this movie. Vishal Shekhar achieved a good grade but did not belong to this film. Why is there a mystical song (Del Hara) in Tashan? Why is not the nice song "Dil Dance Maare" on Anil Kapoor when a person is crazy in English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the movie. But it's the same stereotypical. You will not mind losing this movie.
