I saw this film I do not expect much, I got it in a group of 5 films, all were awesome in their own way under the yeast, what can I expect? And you know what you're right, it was all awful, this movie has a number of interesting points (and few of them provide), the occasional video camera offer a nice touch, the drummer looks like a drummer, that is annoying, the problem is really good , The problem is that it is very boring, since I can only assume that it was an attempt to build tension, not much happens, and when it happens completely boring (my thumb was in fasting) a front button, ready to squeeze most of the film, Good), a serious guy is the main singer of the band that looks fantastic, because they do not remember how beautiful he c I thought a lot, I thought he looked like a spotted, all this I did not even mention the killer, so I will not go into it, it does not deserve clarification. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, only Starr and London are the only reason to watch it, and except for London (which was very funny) it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly saw much worse, but I also saw much better. Better avoid unless you are bored of watching dry paint.
