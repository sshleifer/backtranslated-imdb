The idea of ​​this awaited sequel was really good, and after the great success of the new version, I was expecting with great sincerity. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is really ridiculous and incompetent. The positions are stupid and unreasonable, and the representation is really terrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no favorite characters or violins unlike the new version. Well, this wound is not abundant, when it happens to be really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is very small and it is a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for extreme violence. I mean, there's a Swat team hunting a family of cannibals. Definitely expect something different! When I saw them on movies, I wanted to recover my money. <br /> <br /> In any event, this is a clear example of how accelerated films are transformed into chaos and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess has thrown down the fans of a new edition like me. That's why the order is not welcomed. At least this film is not as horrible as the original 1985 sequel.
