Come on people, you can not be serious, another case of snuff when you are not! This is not scary remotely, scary or corrupt - it's just a totally awesome amateur video, set up for the next party to put the girls in place. <br /> <br /> The gap is so bad, even the eye - the scene is far from making me want to vomit but just made me want to take the camera and hit these guys over the head. The girl just put there rubber face, do not move at all. It was easier to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season of "I'm a famous person, get me out of here!" Is more frightening than this one. Do not waste your time or money.
