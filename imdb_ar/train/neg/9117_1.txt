... or maybe this is bad. The plot is a cheap reworking of the first, which is strange, because it is supposed to be a prelude and not a supplement. The entire film seems to be very much like a cheap new version of the first, where the scenes mimic the things that happened in the first, but it is more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first band had wonderful actors, this group consists of representatives from the B list and refuses. Representation is mostly very bad. Half of the good lines in the film are taken directly from the first, as with almost all major characters, including characters who were not in the first film. I realized that this was set up by an experimental episode of the TV series, but that's no excuse. They did not have to turn the footage (bad) into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, this is an erotic sequence. However, since these are not close to those in the first, even this does not raise them higher than Category 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you are a young man is straight, it is worth checking, if you want something exciting non-pornographic. If not, avoid at all costs. 10/01
