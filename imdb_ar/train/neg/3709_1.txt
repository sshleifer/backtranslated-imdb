First, I would like to say that I admire Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this film is like a summary. The biggest bag of crap ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays the role of ambitious comedian who frightens the stage in a comedy building called Apollo. On his way home from the gig, while riding his motorcycle sees this woman he loves and collides with a truck. Soon after, he chose the body of the old and selfish millionaire. He then dresses like the Outkast music set while trying to recreate the scene from the original where he comes out as a jokey. Second, back to Apollo, trying to be a comedian who tried to be in his former body and begins to mutilate the white population and try to be black. Do you have my floating? This movie is terrible, it is very hard to be like the original and in the process it looks like a bag of crap. Just take my advice and do not even watch this movie.
