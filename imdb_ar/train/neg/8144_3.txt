I saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. The summary appeared in the Festivals Guide so we decided to check it out. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being poorly written, it was boring. I will not give up the actors because there is not much they can do with this bad scenario. <br /> <br /> The first bite was cliche without irony, and the highest degree of seriousness without being funny. It would have been better if Hunt Hunt had gone with a scary horror. Instead he took himself seriously and resulted in a boring film. I can not recommend this film. I felt for a long time and everything is weak.
