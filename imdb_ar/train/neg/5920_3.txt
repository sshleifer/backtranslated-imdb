abnormal? Yeah! <br /> <br /> Unusual preparation for a wartime American film, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> An unusual subject, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one carrying the illegitimate child of a dead son to a senator, lives with seven Marines (one at a time) before being killed by her husband The New Zealand Prisoner. <br /> <br /> It is unusual to see Paul Newman perform such a poor performance shortly after that memorable role of Roque Graziano in the wonderful film "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for the stars of the stars, Joan Fontaine and Jan Simmons, leaving very little of their film. <br /> <br /> It is unusual for me to write a review of such a poor film, and to miss it!
