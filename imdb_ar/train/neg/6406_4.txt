An update of the small plays and jokes you see on stage in the first half of the 20th century. It's a series of many jokes acted. Some of them can say for your grandmother, others do not, but it is a fairly safe bet I've heard of them before. What you are trying to be, not so bad. Before you hire it, remember that it is an old style of entertainment and has more value than history as a comedy or tickle. Robin Williams has a few parts, but it is interchangeable with other players.
