Ettel Merman's fans will also love her wild, hilarious singing like Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "The Wizard Of Oz" is just a real fantasy and the replacement of imagination and excitement with the bustling movement (cheap and repetitive footage like bad video and music). Little Dorothy is returned to Oz, who went to ruin, and meets old and new friends. Intimate animation has been hung somewhere between the weaker Walt Disney and the less inspiring performances of Hanna-Barbera, yet many songs are good, especially Dorothy's lament "It's Too Far Land," by Lisa Minelli. You can count on Minnelli to get power, which is why the movie is full whenever Dorothy is present. Many of these things do not remember, and I'm not sure that baby boomers will get paid for that since they have been traded for a long time. As an element of curiosity, Adel Adel. ** from ****
