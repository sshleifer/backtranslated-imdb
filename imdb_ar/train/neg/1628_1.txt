Without a doubt one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems, really want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is absolutely worthless on every level so that one can only laugh. To reach the desperation of the dirt elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, it follows the day a couple of the city's wildlife ... walk along a shaded road, all the while boasting like a U.C. Berkeley coffee claw. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialogs presented here is very bad ("I feel that life itself consists of many small compartments like these pomegranates .... but is it beautiful?") After what seems to be eternal nothing happens at all (well. Well ... we have dealt with some nudity and lukewarm sexual scene), finally, there is a very counter-impact counter involving my husband from the vets in Nam making the scenery of nature and they doing some very cruel folk stories with acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing at all is full of interesting events or events in this ENTIRE movie. I thought the picture of Larry Buchanan "strawberries need rain" was a poor example of Bergman's greeting. "Golden Apples" is very bad, but the continuous random language that it presents makes them very bad. 10/01
