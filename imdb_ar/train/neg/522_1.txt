About 15 minutes, my wife was really interested in leaving. Not much because of the material, but its lack. They decided to fill in the blanks where they should be ridiculous things with lots of language and vulgar talk as much as possible. When this happens (very rare), we sit and watch (do not laugh, do not wait for you) and wait for the next blatant or offensive observation. After about 35 minutes, we woke up and left. Everything we read said how wonderful it was. The track looks good and Roger Ebert described it as "smart" and said it was not a rude sexual comedy. Have you gone to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever come out of ... and I have no regrets. I'm fed up with trying to go and watch comedies in America.
