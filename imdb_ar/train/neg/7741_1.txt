Josh Hartnett dead eyes, dense writing of it, Harrison Ford in Comedy my friend cop! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid, and take advantage of your life for 116 minutes better. <br /> <br /> Friends movies - the policemen are fun. Yet their real golden age came back in the 1980s and 1990s. Making someone who tries to mix action with comedy through the Hollywood police itself is a good idea, but the end result was not at least a subtype parody but a reason to ask God to please everyone. Previous films of the same genre, while the worst was much larger than (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What really happened to this entertaining formula ?! A decade ago, things were not the same. You will have a stubborn flop of friends after the other. I will be happy to have some titles to catch the disaster well: I Spy - 2002, National Security - 2003, Taxi - 2004, Starsky & Hutch - 2004, and the worst of them all so far (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I think one reason is the natural state of saturation after many similar movie clicks and TV shows in two decades already. Add to that, especially here, neglected handling and boring humor. In fact this issue this time is unbearable. Yes, we have two loyal policemen who have second jobs, the wrong city background, but what was new ?! It's not about cliches. It is a small number of renovations mixed with clich√©s, both of which were poorly done. <br /> <br /> Acting, especially from Hartnett, is terrible. This guy is just a comedian (or actor!). So his character wanted to take revenge for the death of his father! Revenge yourself, man, maybe died because of watching acting !! Even small roles got people who have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they look like here anyway!). <br /> <br /> The directive failed to provide a comic or cruel thing, some parts were able to be high boring (arresting the black man through lack of it ??); it is a rare time to be boring in what is supposed to be Action / Comedy! They have not taken advantage of Hollywood itself, whether it is an ironic place where there is an ugly face behind surface magic, or even as a place with bright or falling stars (a veil that can give it interesting moments). <br /> <br /> It's a very easy film based on being famous only through the magic of its stars, and Buddy-cop will end up as one of the worst two stars with no chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen) Herself! Guess who ?!), and the most destructive Buddy-Cop movie! God, do not make me, or my children, live enough to witness (Hollywood murder? Part 2)! Finally, look at the performance of Harrison Ford, wanted to spend a good time, but we did not do so at least.
