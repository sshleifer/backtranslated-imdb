Well, one has to give the manager credit for his courage. Will be brave in the right term. Not only did he use a group of five people (no extras at all), but he also decided to use substandard special effects with a confusing and tedious plot, as he, I do not practice, warned the beginning of a movie that might die of death !!! However, they prepare CEEOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNN for free. For a creepy gardener gardener is always a good step. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnn .... <br /> <br /> If you see Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen this. They love to show horrible movies, just to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift to someone you hate.
