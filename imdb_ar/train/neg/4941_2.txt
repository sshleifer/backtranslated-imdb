I really had no objection to the first 50 commercial Geico ads so I saw them and found them to be a bit sarcastic and amusing, but seriously! Is this the best thing that these people can come up with?!? This exhibition sucks! It's a nice thing and feels like watching a ring of "desk" with masked characters in the form of caves (I know many of you will hate me to say that but the "office" does not do it for me). Well, I understood that: we have a poor poor man who just tries to keep his nose clean and has a crappy coach dislikes him; a fake intellectual who has really thought barely works; and dopey who just wants to be accepted, but what's in it !!! I've worked with these people and found them annoying in real life just like I do on TV ... Why would I want to waste 1/336 of a week watching more candidates of this kind?!? Please contact your parents and ask if they have put you on your head if you are still thinking about it after thinking about it.
