This was a write-off for the same garbage that we had to see Bob Saget's host half an hour earlier. Dave Coulier thought only that he was funny and that he was pretty much the same program that offered him the most entertaining of American home videos except for hosts with a combined IQ of three. I must really need Tawny Kitaen to the money and it was on Coulier to go to the Recycle Bin for his jokes. It was torture enough to see him imitate Bob and other caricatures washed at Full House. This person who has played all practical jokes on everyone deserves to be at the receiving end of the grade wedgie. I must need Coulier's money to satisfy Alannis Morisette while dating.
