The original Lensman series of classic novels of this genre. I have always wondered why Hollywood is not filmed literally because it is just a kind of thing they love: huge bangs, super weapons and operal heroes, the hero gets the girl and the aliens (great CGI potential), good versus evil in purest Shapes, etc. Instead (taking into account that I am a fan of Japan and anime) we show this terrible film of children that tears the gut of the story, mixes in Star Wars (ridicule as the last of the books from time to time) mocks and mocks everything down to the level of "Thundercats" . To see Kimball Kinnison, an example of a rotating galaxy officer and the second stage she envisioned as a small, pitiful boy (etc.). I can not understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the right to the story and could have made more money (FAR!) By telling them directly. This makes no sense.
