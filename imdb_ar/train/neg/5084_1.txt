I saw this movie twice. I can not believe Pintilie made such a fantastic film. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I think the events take place in the same period as the September 11 incident. No story, no plot, nothing. No finale, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just blank images. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians do not know, this film is for French viewers, not us. They really believe that this is actually in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie must stop making films. I do not really know if we can name this movie, maybe horror :) And wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. This was a reality, but not anymore. "You have no idea of ​​the long Roman road that Ceausescu took from me," said a close friend of the Prith embassy.
