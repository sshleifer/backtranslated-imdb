Definitely the most boring film I've spent on my money. This was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputation. boring! boring! boring! Each character was photographed in a less inspiring way. There is no talent for acting only showing part reading. Alec can play realistic characters naturally, and Gwyneth has made herself look ugly for an irreplaceable part, and Annette needs to advise on how to choose the movies she chooses to play as did all those big stars who left their disappointment in the way they allowed the talent to be Throttle in feature leaves much to be desired in the entertainment area. "Running with scissors" leads the audience to expect a wonderful representation in a film that suggests that he is exposed to deep tension and emotion. There was not a single moment when the cast was able to film any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe the manager's fault ---- whatever.
