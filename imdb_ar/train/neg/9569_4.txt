Definitely not terrible, but it is definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Darrell Rodd directed The Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) by Darrell Rudd and his screenwriter Ronald Harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Patton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around pre-Apartheid South Africa, the stories of a black man and a white man tangled. The pious preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg that he must come immediately; he later found out that his son had killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a black rights fighter, was killed by Kumalo's son. In this link, <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, because I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical Lost in the Stars because I have not seen them too; both seem to be better than this one. But the cry of freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it contains more urgent air, as it really is trying to say something where Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it goes. Very "wishful - washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I enjoyed the novel more than I enjoyed) because the novels and films are completely different channels and it is useless to attempt to transfer one directly to the other or compare them through the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I think it was not so bad, - five out of ten, - but it was not good either. Both lists, both highly qualified actors bring together some of the best wood shows I have seen with some of the most unusual dialogues in the history of the film (but can be blamed on it as a screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who strangely surprises is playing with this film, Also a sublime pianist, being Julia). Among other things, the point of the novel and its themes are almost entirely lost in its third film transition; there is little tension, if any, with any moment of the film, racist or suspended. Music does not help. The pastoral orchestra is misplaced and boring to truly help in this boring film. One of the emerging aspects is cinematography, with many good or brilliant shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film much. <br /> <br /> The last and amazing words of Alan Button's last moments are shown in the film. It is very bad that they seem to be separated from the film that has just been shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela may have seen in this film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
