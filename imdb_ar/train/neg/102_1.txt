My friend once attended The Zombie Chronicles to be seen as a joke. We did not realize that the joke was to pay her 1 pound for it. While watching this movie, I began to find things to do rather than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drink Bleach 2) Rub the sand in the eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Reactivate the American Civil War 5) Tax Returns 6) GCSE Math 7) Old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, also known as Sgt. Ben Dreber wrote this? The man can not even dig a hole properly. The best ting he has done is kicking the door (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I've ever seen, and I saw a white noise: the light. The film did not have many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left her here, so I live now with a huge possession of this piece of nonsense. <br /> <br /> News Only: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Reality. <br /> <br /> You do not see
