Oh my. I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends and wanted to watch one of the moderate Christmas movies and feel good, and I drove out disgusted. The movie failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, whom he considered a good actor, played his character and his words terribly, along with Vince Vaughn, who was always my favorite character. They are trying to turn the Christmas movie into a new style. Kind of bad, mixed with good, but turned out to be all very wrong. The first ten minutes or so were not too bad, but once we saw Santa, it ended. The situation did not improve, the rate remained the same, there was no evolution in character, and certainly one of the worst Christmas films he ever invented. Do not watch it, whatever you do.
