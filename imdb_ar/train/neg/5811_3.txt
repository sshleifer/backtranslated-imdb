I have not seen this film for a long time, but I think I comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of its creativity is heavily burned in the cells of my memory. The original GETAWAY movie was not a debut, but at least marked by 1) Sam Peckinpah, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow it up for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> By comparison, the 1994 version is more than a piece of vanity for Alec Baldwin and his divorced wife Kim Pisinger. McQueen and his wife at the time, McBride, were also split shortly after their film, and one could picture Baldwin's on their marriage board arguing about who was stupid to make the film. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it and get out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been and will not be close to Kohler King, and one of the reasons this new version to my annoyance is the perceived arrogance of Baldwin on the assumption of our memory challenge to Steve McQueen. Leadership role. As another person points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece aimed at a kind of spoof type of motion / adventure theft. On the contrary, Baldwin seems to be trying to make a more serious tone, as bad characters from Michael Madsen and James Woods turn into real people. <br /> <br /> The film also means doubtless energetic and unpopular at a basic level that is hard to put into words. One offer was more than adequate, not only because he did not have anything new to offer but because of how he was made without wits. Peckinpah was actually a small and elegant entertainment that was an upbeat mood. It was a small bar that took a very long time to reach little or nothing. There is no technical urgency to its existence, and some uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that it is hard to enjoy the film. <br /> <br /> So I do not know, maybe this was one of the films that helped to start a great wave of technically useless, re-creating a big and lively budget around a representative / brand representative at the time, Not good. I always prefer seeing at least a film director trying to come up with a new idea of ​​a movie and its fall with something original. This film has just made me want to get out my eyebrows, and it reveals that over the next 15 years since its launch, Mr. Baldwin has become widely known as one of Hollywood's greatest tremors. Thank God for the "America team" to put it in place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
