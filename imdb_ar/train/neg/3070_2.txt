Oh, dear sir .... They have turned what was a very exciting film into a testosterone ventured festival. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this film was ambiguous about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a proof. Why was he willing to risk his life for a handful of upper parts? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had a few memories of the past that gave us a picture that he was addicted to the adrenaline, presumably he led his entire life in an attempt to make it fade away. That point you see in the distance where the shoulders of the right and left roads meet, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and does not mean anyone. We saw several times when there were stopovers to make sure that the other driver was fine before moving on, even the policemen who were chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw in vain in his quest, he took his life. Rather than being arrested and living the life of the prisoner. He died as he lived, and he worked wide. <br /> <br /> In a new edition, Kowalski has a full history (including the first name, so). He is trying to reach the hospital where his wife suffers from complications of pregnancy. He is a loyal husband and an enthusiastic father. He had made up his mind after hearing that his wife had died during childbirth, but they left it in question when they suggested he might have jumped out of the car before hitting the bulldozers. They even gave the part of the Super Soul, the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
