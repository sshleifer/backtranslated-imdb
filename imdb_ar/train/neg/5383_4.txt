I think I should start by saying that almost any work style can be fun in parts. The real test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is why I was given the analog title for this review. Most of us - even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs - agree that blogs can not be compared to good fiction for several reasons. Similarly, FEM can not be compared with a good film industry for a number of reasons, and I already believe it is a bad example of independent cinematography. From start to finish, FEM looks like a video blog bundled together. (Heck, so MySpace gets some pimping.) If I want to see one hour of the only girl 15 - I do not - I'll go to watch it. FEM, though certainly richer than the bubble gum atmosphere of the above-mentioned media, is so personal that without an interesting story. It's like watching worldly life, which I think most of them would agree to be very naturally dull. However, FEM creators want to pay tribute to it, a very postmodern film about filmmaking. Delay on yawning. <br /> <br /> In the end, she has moved away from me, I do not care about a few of them. I am shocked because I am really interested in dedicating some time to writing this review, even. It's not that FEM is so bad, because it's not; it's been a few moments when she smiled a smile or thought that - perhaps only - something interesting was about to happen. It is rather just plain ... modest. I feel so indifferent to him that he makes it perfectly appropriate for Aximurun: emotional indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators / "actors" in the film will get out of their debt. They may need it when someone moves on and continues to live. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste it and do not want to do anything; otherwise, pass it by, and do not worry that you have missed some wonderful and undiscovered talent. You really do not.
