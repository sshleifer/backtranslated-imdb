A man walks around without motivation ... I will not get these two hours of my life. The man continued to carry his IDs and cheat his pregnant wife. What are you thinking? How did this price win anywhere? I understood that he loved his father but otherwise the film was totally meaningless to me. What is the purpose of walking too much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How does this enrich his life ?? Why should we see the old lady dying on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> Although it will be deep or around something more interesting. I would not recommend the movie even to leave during sleep ...
