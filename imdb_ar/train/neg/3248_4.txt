Why did you go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in the past, and in the past he made funny films that made me cry with laughter, do you really expect me to expect that again? In addition, the funny premise, trailer, starring Jennifer Aniston, and the fact that it was a great success in the United States encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as one line summary suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a two-hour movie, I laughed for about 5 to 10 minutes ... together, the rest of the time I sat thinking "you really got some ice cream". I admit it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he really expects when he makes a jewel like "Truman's Show," "Liar Liar," "I, Myself and Irene," "Dump" "" The Mask "and" Ace Ventura ", in the words of Bruce Nolan, such an intermediate film? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The criminal has been upheld as Jennifer Aniston. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: One word - clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: Unofficial publication of specific US references - Jimmy Hoffa, Week sweep "Walter Cronkite - is proof of Film-grown specifically appeal. "Do not say any bettor drugs and yes to education - this is a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? "It's a miracle!" God tells Bruce, which is very stressful and seems to have fallen back in the United States, but it may face stiffer resistance in markets that keep hidden decisions.In addition, I still go to school and this statement suggests to me and all my friends Miracles ... or maybe that means we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this film, there are funny comic moments that make you laugh and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a complete disaster, but it is advisable to start reviewing your expectations down.
