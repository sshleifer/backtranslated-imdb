I remember when this piece of trash came out, all the newspapers were about how Barbara Streisand took years to make the film. Well, it could not have taken so many years; the play opened only in 1975, eight years ago. I made the Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably was supposed to have been filmed in the movie, but NOOOOO ... Great STAR BARBRA HAD to do. And with no less music! This film is a complete disaster from start to finish. For one thing, Barbara FORTY YEARS OLD was when I made it and was looking forward to it every minute. There was no way any of them could swallow it as a small girl eager to study the Torah. Then when she wears her clothes as a boy gets a camp. I have the impression that Streisand could not afford to be unattractive so I played around with make-up. She is as beautiful as a boy than she is as a girl. As if this is not bad enough, she gets involved with her classmate Avidjur (Mandi Patinkin, her best moments being her naked end shot) and his fianc√©e (Amy Irving, whose normal protein sleeps, When the director ignores her and she does not know what to do). Yentl goes beyond marriage of the girl. I would not even bother to mention the "Wedding Night" scene. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music. Nine completely memorable songs, all sung by Streisand across the sound through the sound (presumably supposed to look inside her mind), and each song is intrusive and irritating like nails on the blackboard. <br /> <br /> I will not say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some beautiful pictures (private backside Patinkin) and she has a good eye to balance. The problem with this film is that it will not go out of its way. I did not believe her for a second in the role of title; you should never add songs, and the entire mess lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was fed up with the whole mess after forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> Awful, awful, awful.
