A dysfunctional family goes home to vacation, kill and kill anarchy. Milijan is violent at most of his home. A little better than my home movie (like so many Milligans movies), it is a journey to the corrupt style of the 1960s. This film is not considered laughable and sex due to nudity and profane sex, which is now more attractive. The film suffers from its uneven slowness and production licenses. (No one was sure where his money had gone since he'd always broken it). It's a bad film that is only worth seeing as a full-fledged Melijan or because it has some good-looking people who are deluded.
