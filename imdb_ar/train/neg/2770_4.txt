Hollywood Hotel was the last musical directed by Busby Berkeley for Warner Bros. His style of directing has changed or evolved to the extent that this film does not contain signature shots or huge production numbers with thousands of additions. By the last few years of the 1930s, big swing-style teams were scoring the biggest popular songs of the year. The Swing era, also known as the Big Band Era, was dated from 1935 to 1944 or from 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to determine exactly the moment that the Swing era began, the participation of Benny Goodman in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles was late The summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early signs that the swing was in the consciousness of mainstream American youth. When Goodman showed his swing swing instead of the community-style dance that his band was playing, young people in the audience became angry. That was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts and mouths were the basic ways to spread these phenomena, it took some time before the swings swung enough to produce large invasions on pop charts. In the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman, Orchestra, Raymond Paige and an orchestra in the film suggests that the film industry was ready to take advantage of the shift in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half after the clash of Goodman Palmer Hall). There are a few exciting musical moments here and there at the Hollywood Hotel, but except for the Benny Goodman and the Orchestra "Singing, Singing and Singing", there is not much to be commended. Otherwise, the most interesting musical series is the opening of "Hayay for Hollywood" and "Let That Be Less to You" in the car restaurant. The film is the most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his play orchestra and the vocals of Dick Powell and Francis Langford.
