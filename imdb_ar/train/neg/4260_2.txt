Yes correct. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the movie to begin. It was terribly boring and consisted mostly of people riding around the hills indiscriminately without any clear direction. Then the hero comes to the picture. He was born Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. It was not even close to the Asian pass. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was very distracted, and the story did nothing to help the cause. The meaningless battle sequence and lame dialogue. It was an hour and forty-five minutes, and in the end I was trying to eat my face. I saw this because the people in my video shop always ask me if this movie is good or not. Now I have an answer. Something like this goes: important. "No, well, no, it's horrible, do not do this yourself, I recommend another movie, maybe a fun movie."
