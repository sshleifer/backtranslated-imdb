DEUS HUSBANDS is a rather silly comedy about a handful of wives conspiring to get rid of their husbands. It's not as embarrassing as some comedies I can mention but never spoil their potential. Imagine how this could have been good if our brothers Varelli were directing Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Hey Carter depends on Jerry Springer? Just curious because the catch phrase in Dr Elson`s view "takes care of each other and continues to talk"
