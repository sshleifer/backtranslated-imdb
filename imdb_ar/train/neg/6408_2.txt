UPA movies are surprisingly rated on IMDb despite the fact that the quality of the animation is lagging behind in the years of Loney Tunes, Disney and MGM in prime. Unfortunately, due to the high costs of producing beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA (first introduced in 1950) began to dominate in the late 1950s and 1960s. After all, the films were dirt cheap and they made many Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons are now prevalent. As a result, poor animation became the norm and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> UPA is one of the first films. The characters are simply drawn (that is, they are simpler and they use neural shapes) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with added colors in a very slap style (often using a sponge and rarely filling the elements in full). <br /> <br /> As for the story, jive with strong jazz style stand. Some will like this, others will find it very high. It's the classic Frankie and Johnny story and because of all the shooting, it's probably not a great movie for children. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a very good movie for me, too! Some will read my assessment and no doubt I crank (and I, to some extent). However, I like animation films and a bit of this simple UPA method goes a long way and you can not seriously think of great works of art - just cartoons made very quickly. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or anything else - nothing else!
