A night concert about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) is chased by a psychic killer trying to kill her on the night of the party. Killing her family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now before I start let me say I'm fed up with PG-13 horror movies that have not been scary lately. Are you tired of dialogue stupid girl "Oh my God" and talk about the ugly things. Are you really tired of girls in relationships and then cry. The final thing is that you are tired of reproducing Asian, Japanese and Chinese films in the United States. This sums up pretty much the night of the prom but I'm still not finished from the review. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "Prom Night" is to eliminate laughter. If not, do not see a night prom. You do not see killing kills just screaming and seeing some blood on the wall. Incidentally, deaths are repeated like 24/7. So not only are they not scary, it's disgusting. By the time I met the staff, I thought I was ready to meet. The girl talks a lot, talking a lot about the man, and a lot of "my God." It's our prom. I understand it is fun but seriously it is to ask not to focus. <br /> <br /> If I'm going to make a night concert on the worst movies list for 2008 without watching other movies, I'll be the first movie too. I would not be surprised if they were released on DVD at a cheap and fast price. Seriously do not spend your money or time representation boring, cheap horror, "Night to die for" when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> One star is out of 10. (Note: If I can give a zero star movie I would).
