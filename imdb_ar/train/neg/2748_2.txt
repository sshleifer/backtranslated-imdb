This film gets a second star just because I work in the city center and I love to see it destroyed. The effects were very good - I hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. Being the most expensive and still extremely awful makes it a huge waste of money. I hired him so as not to complain much about what I paid, but I only came back for a few hours. Many plot holes. Terrible acting in all areas. I do not recommend giving up enough time to watch this film, life is too short. If your friends want to see this, run away. I can not confirm enough that this film was bad. <br /> <br /> Where did the hell come from? Why did not he appear sooner? How did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
