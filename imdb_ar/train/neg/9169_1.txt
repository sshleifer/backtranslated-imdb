It's really bad. The only half way recovery quality is the effects on the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. Representation is terrible, except for Kirk. The story is a shovel like a trophy, and the belief that a movie is a video game in itself kills the film only, if it is not already a corpse. So in all it is a waste of your life. I had given this zero this option on the scale rating.
