Hey, if you have just over an hour to kill and show that the paint is very sexy, I suggest it. If you like cheap b movies like me, that's good to laugh! Otherwise, I will not suggest you rent it, I'll wait until it comes on the screen, say the fourth round on the free access channel for your cable / satellite provider. The band that did this audio track by the way was on the road about two years after this crack, and it did not seem that they were quite bad according to my small town review which I can find. So, again good if you find that grass grows a lot but it's fun to watch if you want to know how not to shoot a low budget movie.
