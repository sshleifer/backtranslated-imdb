You like beautiful girls? Yes. Me too. What can you say about beautiful girls / women? There was not any emo, so why would I give this movie only two stars out of 5, although it got the "talents" Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really want to see beautiful people, I'll watch MTV or something for that reason. This is a movie, however called motion film. So by virtue of definition does not really require a true conspiracy? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes to it. So what do you need? 20-minute clips from part 1 (maybe a bit overpriced, but I felt more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "no". But again you never know, people who have seen the first part may not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so let them remember ... maybe even remember them twice? Just to make sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits expire, of course! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, about the evolution of personality, about real feelings, about "acting" (no, I do not think women who wear skirts walking and / or fighting are responsible for acting!) ... What leaves this ? Yes motion scenes. Motion scenes are not bad and that's why I was given a 2 star movie instead of 1! You give this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... you have better things to do / watch it, believe me ...
