Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long original production of Michael Bennett. It was a great experience and I paid for watching the movie when I returned to cinemas in 1985. It's horrible. Almost everything failed. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a sad choice - almost as bad when John Huston was set to shoot ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut songs and cast stones !!! They are terrible - the power of the play was those dancers - these gifted jays artists just want an opportunity to show what they can do and when they get their chance - you can not close your eyes to them. But this cast is just a dance, singing "beautiful" vocals but none of them spark a single spark. In fact, look for actors on IMDb - none of them have ever done anything much. (Well, well, Janet married Jones from Gretzky-sheesh). So the wreckage of this movie train does not hold the magic, despair, passion for the musical stage for a second. A total strike! (But even though they are trying to throttle the music - the wonderful music continues to rise sometimes and people remember how wonderful the result was).
