I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and say my words, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox - # 1 We simply do not walk around with our pockets crammed with theater tickets and $ 100 bills! # 2 If you allow anyone to use a room for some "afternoon" time I'll be shot right away! My organization (Les Clefs d'Or) has very specific ethical and behavioral standards that we take very seriously. # 3 Similarly, the Dogg concept, at the end of the film, was simply to remove the golden key and transfer it to another employee. We win these keys, a badge of honor and knowledge that allows us to wear them. There is a full process of request and verification to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of Concierge as a non-mercenary. In short, it is damaging our Organization. I welcome any comments.
