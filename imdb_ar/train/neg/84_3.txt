When I was a kid I thought that the weapon used by the murderer was wonderful, yet I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even if he was a stupid kid even though the film plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the film has really strong actors. What text they read when they agreed to be in this film, because it is completely boring, a way to show light saber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is completely chaotic. The entire film seems to revolve around foreigners and weapons. This plot contains two children and the other faces a strange confrontation, after years of flash seems to be back as it was in the mix. Dead animals and such things will be explored and for some reason, the dude gets the weapon of the aliens and continues to use it to go in a very light kill wave. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this film is produced and if you get a killer you have some good death scenes and if you encounter strange encounters you will see more than a weird little spiral thing and if you go to your light swords then call yourself Star Wars .
