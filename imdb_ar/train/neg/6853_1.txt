Another quick hit from category Z of Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson, the 13-inch Clint Eastwood cop from outer space chasing an ugly head (!) To the ground and taking part in a guerrilla war in the South Bronx! Short with a mercy, but devastatingly boring, with the most spectacular effects since the attack on the Woman 50Ft. They had to launch a man's continuity as well: Notice how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappear in every second shot. Too bad, but that's why we watch these movies, right? Sequence ollDollman Vs. The devilish play is said to be worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (****) <br /> <br />
