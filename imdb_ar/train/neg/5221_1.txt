Hi, I'm from Denmark, and one day, I was spending an evening in the movie with my friends. One brought this film with him "Russian Terminator" and it was very awful. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to move forward just by stopping at some ridiculous "highlights" or should I say "lights" in the film. I was often surprised when I discovered that this film was produced here in Denmark's homeland ... which should have been the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
