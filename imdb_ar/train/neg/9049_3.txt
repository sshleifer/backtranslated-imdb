Social commentary "on racism and prison conditions in the southern countryside of the 1970s," Nightmare "is full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with dialects. This is not only offensive to the sensitivities of most South Americans, this amazing work comes as a "babe in prison" is especially disguised - especially in its original unpolished version. However, acting is generally above average, and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him - although he seems rather uncomfortable in several scenes. There is also the role of speed change by the late Robert Reid, who appears as a punk guard, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger) in Gilligan Island, who has made a reasonable jail guard for the prison. My appreciation: D. <br /> <br />
