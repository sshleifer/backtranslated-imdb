First of all, I am not a fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is why the usual style to create box office success is by hitting the waist. This film is not a masterpiece dealing with taboo, as the director and marketing advertising means. In my opinion only, the sole purpose of this film is to make money by touching the sensitive morale (in fact considered mostly taboo in the original country). May provide cheap populism with a brief definition of what I meant. <br /> <br /> However, the representation is close to perfection. In fact, most of the cast has a play background and tried hard to make up for what Tyler lacked; talent! All the team members were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even those less experienced. (Like Janset) at least, Altioklar deserves a small tribute, just because he knows how well to choose the cast. Otherwise, he is just an informational monkey, supposed to be a talented director. Come on, art is not something that consists only of dealing with naked / half-naked women. Because the media is proud of it, no exit is a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Close your ears and something genuine technician, I am eagerly waiting applause for your next business. I hope this time you can achieve a technical approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good disposition, hot ladies (just joking!) :) Cons> All but One Crew
