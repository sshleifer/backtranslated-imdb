Today, Bea Arthur died so I was wandering around IMDb's web site and somehow ended up in a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a fantastic show for the first four or five years and I bet I watched each episode more than once. However, I swear I do not know there is a show called "Gloria". Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe, that means I lived a young man instead of watching TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the privilege of "everything in the family" has deteriorated so much that it has shown that I have never heard of it before - and one that has been rated very badly by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I rated the show 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to record a vote and the writers and television journalists should not be condemned to start a show that does not include any commercial activity on the air and leads to the memory of one of the greatest performances in television history. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
