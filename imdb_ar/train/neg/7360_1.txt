This is one of the worst motion movies I have ever seen. This is due in particular to a lot of real unreasonableness (such as a clear agent acting as a bank loan officer with an explanation that he is talking to someone through a wire or a scene where scientists believe it is safe to enter a room where the virus has been released although " Finding a viable host "does not mean he will never find it), cheap groups (the bank seems to have been bad to resemble a dungeon) and misconduct. It is the story of the organized crime group that successfully stole a capsule from the deadly virus. However, the chairman of the board, who decides to remove it from the Aman deposit box, does so at the same time as a bank falls, and at the same time FBI agents are informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake breaks out. . Needless to say, the effects of the earthquake are chaotic in many ways. However, the results do not produce an attractive action film, but instead, it was a first-rate film from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is why some of the footage that appears on the packaging looks like it is created using computer graphics rather than being a real screen capture of different sequences of the film). What the hell Ron Perleman was doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was embarrassed because he was watching.
