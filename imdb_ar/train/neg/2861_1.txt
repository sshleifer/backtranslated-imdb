I can not believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn flick when it started and never improved. Acting, and music that sinks actors. terrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through knowing that the music will sink the speaking lines. I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue showing cows and pigs slaughtered. What does this have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there are no actors / actresses famous in this film. The script was going to turn me away from the first page of reading. It would be better to see dry paint.
