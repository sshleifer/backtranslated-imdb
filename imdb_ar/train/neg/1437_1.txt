I missed the first ten minutes or so of the movie but I do not think watching it from the start would have made any difference. I found the film very boring and I was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in prominent roles but they are all disappointed here because of a very weak script. "Kind Solomon's Mine" ... The very short part of the film inside the Mines was just as exciting as watching dry paint and I suspect that even a pre-school child could have been associated with dictation by watching the battle of the warriors. Reminds us of an American television series that was produced cheaply Give me Indiana Jones any day!
