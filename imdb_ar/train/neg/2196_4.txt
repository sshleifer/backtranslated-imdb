Brain (or head) that will not die is one of the most exploitable films of the low-minded budget of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how written text could be written on this sexual distinction without the intention of parody. The themes repeatedly expressed by young women, Ginny Leith - a separate head kept alive by machines, I-Vs, and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was intended to exploit gender stereotypes and criticism at the same time. Helena's Boxing Shades with the lowest rating. <br /> <br /> Gender discrimination is plentiful, and irritating like an angry ants army. The dialog is overpriced, over-excited, unbelievable, and behaving just fine (but not fixed). Why was this movie given 4? Because some thinking clearly went to it. I'm not really sure where the film was actually trying to highlight it, but it seems clear that it is striving for some kind of anomalous and unusual horror (without blood and audience today). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting part of the brain is that there are actually no heroes in this movie, and there are no particularly popular characters. <br /> <br /> In view of all this, this is a rather painful and troubling sight in the early 1960s, American folk life, from a woman's point of view, survived despite its lost body after it should not have been To be a fatal car accident. Threatens her lover to sew a new body of high quality and force them to continue to live with him. It is incomprehensible in every sense of the word and is forced to establish a friendship with a creature almost as brutal as its friend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the clich√©s of the 1950s / 1960s about the evils of science, which is going well. <br /> <br /> Recommended for students of the Faculty of Science and Graduate Studies in Gender Studies. O / W is not recommended.
