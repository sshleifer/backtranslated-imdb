A group of very unwanted holes tormented by lame dolls Some elderly guards in the evening shower bag have been locked in a movie cellar for twenty years without reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie only from MST3K's immediate rendition of the movie. But I saw the actual film and I can safely say it is a really bad yes really bad. From one of the most horrifying "fighting" scenes I have ever seen to the stuffed "aliens" game that suffers from immobility (I had a wild animal that was even more terrifying) down to the heinous act (I had my monster pets that were more attractive) However, to be said movies "Vice-Academy Rick Sloan" somehow, trust me I have no idea how the earth, much worse. This does not mean that this film is nothing but nonsense, because it is not. Just throw it there. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: There is no nudity in the appropriate movie, but there is a couple of breasts on the DVD for the movie <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; photo gallery and trailer for this film
