Well ... it seems so far, only commented on the fans of Barman on this film - it's time to get an interview point. Beware, this writing is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (mostly non-Belgians): Tom Berman, the director of this film, is considered the most prominent character of dEUS, one of the most famous rock artists in the late 1990s here in Belgium. Basically, they made very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame at the national level. After that, Vanity began to hurt and the band split mainly, with Barman and two others remaining in album work under dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in such cases, the dEUS that followed the collapse of the game was more distinctive and less interesting than the original. They tried to make international progress with their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, where they presented a very mild form of their previous style of songwriting. They did not. However, vanity was still apparently great: big enough for Berman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on films. <br /> <br /> This type of error is often considered too big a mistake, and this movie does not make an exception. It is obvious that Barman went to * art * in this, another big mistake too. For one reason, he is a musician and not a film director. For another, the dEUS at its best ridicules it and excites music, but not anything close to what I was thinking of * art *. he shows. <br /> <br /> So, what is this film? Basically, he tells the story of a group of people who do not care enough, and do things that are not equally involved on a totally uninterested Friday in Antwerp, where more interesting things happen to them because they are not interested. The characters are shallow, the plot is completely useless and the film just does not have any other replacement qualities to compensate for these flaws. humor? The whole movie made me smile (a little) about 3 times and managed to make one 5-second laugh (not too loud). mood? The film does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. mystery? Well, (MINOR SPOILER *) The idea of ​​the Wind Man, inspiring to the name of the movie, is such a wonderful idea as a pizza banana pepper - not so important, it has been done a thousand times (remember anyone Johnny Destiny) - one of the worst apparitions Tarantino in the film so far) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). As well, * Technician *, so do not expect any kind of real work to make up for the former. In other words, except for a few smiles, I was bored by my short shorts. <br /> <br /> What's left? Well, the soundtrack is very good, although it has some of the same problems OST has shown recently: First, it makes the movie look more than a CD commercial. Second, gives the impression that Barman tries to hide the weaknesses and the lack of emotional content in the film behind the quality of the songs content, which simply does not work. In the end, the film makes more than just an illustration of the songs. Unfortunately, Barmans' own contribution to soundtracks is of the greatest interest, although it weakens part of the entire soundtrack as much as I am concerned. All in all, it clearly shows that Barman knows more about music than films. The camera's work is fine too, but nothing makes you scream with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me watch this movie was what kept me watching. Since I was from the city of Antwerp, it was good to play a kind of "guess the site" game. I would hardly consider it as good. <br /> <br /> In general, another Flemish film has been missed. I still notice that recently, the best Belgian films were coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because, at least, they have what they want to manage and tell him in a sharp and emotional way (the Dearden brothers come to mind). Filmish filmmakers may have to try it too.
