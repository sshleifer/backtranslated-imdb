This movie is enjoyable enough because of the excellent performance of Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsay Han is beautiful. However, the reason for the film's predictability is that we've seen it all before. I did not read A Mother's Gift, but I wish Britney and Lynn Spears had a different idea. Unless you think of ending a movie with what is basically a music video original idea, the entire film brings back to mind the word "fake".
