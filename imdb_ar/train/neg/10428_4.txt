Did anyone else feel betrayed as I felt? The first hour or so was very solid but final. My God. It seems to have been predictable and cheesy. Not as great and epic as the full range of the show was. I've been reading most glowing reviews but I can not really understand why. I seriously expected the end of the WAY to end earlier but I backed away from it because I thought, "No, they will never do that, that's very lame." I can hardly stand it. I feel dissatisfied. I think I'm about to go out the door to go for sale every season I own. Someone please. I changed my mind. I want to love this. Very bad. Someone told me why I was wrong. a great offer. Awesome end.
