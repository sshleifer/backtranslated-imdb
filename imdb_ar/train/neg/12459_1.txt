Considering the amount of money allocated to this movie, you expect more of the story as a whole. This is probably the most valuable film I have ever seen. There was no real progress for anything. Personal development, minimum. A plot to advance, perhaps. Enjoy, nothing. I'm not sure what points she was trying to make. If you want to see a movie in which terrorists are good people, the CIA will bomb everything that does not agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you want to see anything like the evolution of the story with death. For those of us who realize that it does not require killing a good man to make a point, we will stick to other films. In short, this was a terrible attempt to film "Oceans 11" similar to the film "hide the conspiracy" that a person may think because he does not know just what is happening, did not do one either. Home Alone was 3 better.
