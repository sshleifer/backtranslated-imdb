It seems that this is the only film John Sexton ever produced, and he had a good sense of stopping after that and staying in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, which is dull and scrawny with nothing happening. The war hero in Viet Nam takes up the task of working with the mob leader, gets a little friendship with the wife, then kills the wife by the mob leader himself, and the hero of the war is framed and sent to prison, sentenced to death, specifically. Now, this particular prison is experimenting with prisoners and testing some formulas that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (coma). Of course, everything is fine, then there are all those people trapped in prison, some of them turn into zombies and the rest who no longer want to suddenly stay there. This continued to be continuous with nothing special to show or say about himself. I stopped him before the end, and he seemed to come several times but no, he seemed to be only willing to take off on a different and equally boring course. If you watch until the end it may become a coma in itself, so do not risk it. 2 of 10.
