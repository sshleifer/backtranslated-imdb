Kenneth Branch is trying to transform the mysterious William Shakespeare comedy that is rarely produced into a 1930s-era music, both of which are both a bad Shakespeare and a bad musical comedy because actors are rarely good at any other method and in some cases staggering in both. It is particularly painful that Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is hysterical just like Costard but very wrong, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with Shakespeare's language with all the power of a teenage valley girl, reads the text aloud. English class at middle school. <br /> <br /> The music numbers are shown with the experience of producing a high school called "Dames at Sea", making actors look awkward and amateur while singing and dancing, with the sole exception of Adrian Lester, who proves himself a great song and dance man. The only other feature in the film was Natasha McClone's and Emily Mortimer's contribution to the eye, but they made much better performances than this film, and it would be wise to review some of the other titles in their films and to give this chaos without a pass.
