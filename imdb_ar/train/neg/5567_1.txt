Well, I hired this movie because of the director ... He made some interesting clicks in the past (if you have not seen Waxork then you're missing an enjoyable trip). Anyway, I had doubts about this film from the start, but I decided to suck it and give it a look. It's bad too bad. If you do not see the movie and do not mind reading the spoilers. First of all, the old saying goes "You can not judge a book through its cover" here. The square of this click appears to indicate that Jill is a long-haired fox with long hair. The back of the box has a cool shot of red-skin generation and some other shots. Description Makes you want to rent a movie because it looks good. You start watching it and suddenly you discover that the film happens (inexplicably) in 1977. Gill is the total dog that is not the girl on the cover. The film can not be predicted as you think ... this is not a good thing. The characters do a lot of stupid things without any amount of motivation ... it is embarrassing to see them. 10 minutes before the end of the film "Dolph" and another woman having sex for no good reason. Also, what was the purpose of killing Dolph this other cold-blooded lady who were helping him. Director Anthony Hickox should have seen Netna when he read the text. Had he been appointed in the underworld of the new millennium and made midway figures smart for it would have been decent. His status in the 1970s has no meaning and has no effect on the story at all. avoid it!
