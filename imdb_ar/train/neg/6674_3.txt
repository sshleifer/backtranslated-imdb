I would like to admit that the draw is directed by Eduardo SÃ¡nchez, who led the charming and charming magician of Blair. Moreover, this is a strange film of some kind, and it looked like Dreamcatchers to Stephen King, one of those films that critics hated, but I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> I, unfortunately, felt that in most parts, it was a waste of time, so I will keep this review brief. Buildings are always promising, change is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who suffered from strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a story of imagining things. Alien abduction stories must always deal with probes in openings, so I will not go into details, but you feel uncomfortable, and this is something you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if I were given a chance to retaliate? That is, you can manage the tracker successfully, and pick up one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a cheerful recovery period, or so they thought. This is where the film begins to evolve into a nap, with a bad, uninspiring dialogue, and worse representation. Even if the budget is low, there are not many recovery factors, be it story power, or any help from representatives in making their characters just an interesting boy. It's the standard cardboard fare from a regular vanilla scenario, along with some of the cheap scare tactics used. <br /> <br /> What is good though make-up. There has been a lot of effort in making some things I did not mention, because that will only spoil some of the elements that make this movie acceptable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and pleasant moments, something you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> See this as a last resort only. Compared to the other monster film in the city - the feast, this film is less fun, and takes itself very seriously. Swamp by direction is uninspiring, you have been warned.
