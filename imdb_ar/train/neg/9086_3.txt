I was familiar with Romer's admiration for the late works of those he considered a great cinematic, and that natural viewers were generally regarded as artistic failures (such as the recent Renoir or Chaplin films; yes, "politique des auteurs" also had its dark side). But with Les Amours d'Astrée et de Céladon, it seems as if Romer himself, for what may be his last film, wanted to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a final film about the older, by adapting "L "Astrée" of Urfé ", with silly aesthetic symbols, the charming looks just a parody of the recent Rossellini films (those made by television from the life of Descartes or Marx). <br /> <br /> In his novel" Perceval ", Romer refused to A real landscape film in order to give a re-copy of what might be a middle-aged classical representation of things. It seems that the director changed his mind when it came to the 17th century, and representatives of the Flam, dressed like the peasants of the 1600's, read their ancient text surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes, but everything seems more ridiculous than Lucieni and his fake trees. (I do not speak about the annoying pronunciation of actors, and try the annoying and sad humor by Rudolph Baoli, the mildly ironic tone, the poor musical temples, or the curious fascination of investment!). <br /> <br /> The root aesthetic of the film eventually makes it look like a joke, and mixes a soft erotic film made for television with theological school discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Romer teaches us that the original French region of the story is now distorted by modernity, which is why he was forced to film "L'Astrée" in other parts of the country. However, I am sure that the film will look more modern and interesting, if Römer would actually portray the same story in a modern area with the same narrative symbols and artistic decisions. This film may raise the interest of some historians, but most of the films may laugh at the recent and sad Romer.
