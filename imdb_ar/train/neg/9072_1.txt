This film has no plot and no focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a slap, a stupid comedy, but the screen makers do not have an idea of ​​the film. Even the title is not in line with the film. It should be called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares about what happens to them! The girl's room character (from the 1970s show) was the only person worth seeing. She was fun and stole in every scene she was in. Others need to make sure that their college degrees are in business because they will need a profession other than acting.
