Well, this film certainly had a great deal of hype; from participating in the Toronto Film Festival to quick comments on CBC Radio. Apparently, Indie's film is refreshing, wacky, seemingly hilarious. I've been looking at it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I put it simply? Sucked in a very big way. An exercise in a cinematic labyrinth makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, he was moderately amused and at worst a coma. A poorly directed and poorly edited Amiri scenario in shaky chaos. <br /> <br /> And what about the fact that the music is 500 dB higher than the rest of the audio track? It was the only truly strange thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a really strange and funny movie involving foreigners, try Repoman. No comparison!
