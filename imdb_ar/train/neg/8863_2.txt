Iwe II (1985) was full of the first film. While the first film was campy and creepy. The second was haggard and cheesy. The production values ​​on this one are very bad and the representation ugly. The brother of the bearded announcer of the first part wants to know what happened to his sister. The scene from the first movie was badly recreated. A thin, slim-faced woman who accompanied her brothers (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery of her brother's death / conversion / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a kind of wise / guide to Monday. Siebel Daning and her biggest company appear in the movie "Stirpa", the head of the doomed in Romania. Also suffer from bad condition for the morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> A bad movie. There is nothing good about this stink. I'm surprised that Philippe Mora directed this picture because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content but the film stock itself). To bring the film closer, you get a poor "punk" performance from the witty "Babel". Maybe if you skip a few extra dollars, they might be able to get the real deal rather than imitate it. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid them unless you are desperate or lost your remote control and you are too lazy to change the channel.
