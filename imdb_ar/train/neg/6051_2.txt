urgh! 3 Things the film needs: Good script, good plot and good wording. I watched this movie expecting to be very terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was terrible. I have lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that prevented me from stabbing my eyes outside the fork was Rose Byrne (who was the reason for seeing me in the first place). She has done a good job like Rastus and her appearance has not changed much since she was thirteen years old. It was a wonderful effort in a film. The dog was also very good. They both did a wonderful job with such horrible material. Sandra Bernhard thought it was the biggest mistake of the film. It was totally wrong, and I do not think it ever got personal. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - this is because I just rose.
