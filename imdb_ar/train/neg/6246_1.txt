Do not touch some points of interest .. But! - Failed to show evidence of all "exclusive" studies shown. Who are "friends" and "small groups of scientists" who have collected this data? - What's the matter with every Al Gore biography going on there? Such as how he liked to play with the cows at the farm or that his child was exposed to a car .. very bad but .. what should I do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I saw much better things, much less in time, on the Discovery Channel .. I do not really understand why they get a high score on IMDb. Unless you live under a rock, this "documentary" should not be any news to you ... All this is old news ... All Al Gore is trying to do is get some popular points. Note I am not an American, so do not even try to say that I admire Bush
