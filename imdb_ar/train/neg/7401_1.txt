* Breathe * Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea, blow it disproportionately and try to market it as wonderful. Lordi is a modest band at best and will bring you only one gimmick so far. <br /> <br /> To all that you market from idiots: That's why the inherently complex of minorities that you often encounter in Finland is trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lourdes Lame. Lordi has finished. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced horror. Sure, they won the Eurovision Prize. <br /> <br /> No, wait - they've won the Eurovision Award. This is. I finished my case.
