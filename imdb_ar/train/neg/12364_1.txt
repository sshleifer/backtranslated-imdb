Oh my God, I'm very sick of the nonsense that comes out of America and is called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Because animations are common, cartoonists in the United States either produce a cartoon with a five-year-old zombie ass. Drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese animation. (Usually messed with the classic characters) No wonder the American cartoon wins! <br /> <br /> They are not trying yet! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about this last night; I live in the UK and when I discovered that this show was first released in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was very modern with current offers.
