Before George Romero's Night of the Dead Dead, zombies were relatively well-intentioned creatures. They definitely had much better table than in the old days. But social etiquette aside what excitement did these early zombies make to the cinema audience? If we judge through this film, nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around an exploratory trip to Cambodia, the purpose of which is to find and destroy the mystery of fraud. One party discovers secrets on its own and begins to build up its zombie army. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombie. But since this film is thirty years old, these zombies are more like some ginger than the variety of food we are thinking today. They seem to respond to mind control, rather than an unsatisfying appetite. Quite frankly, the "revolution" is somewhat disappointing. Everything is really very boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no melodramatic play over the top to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this has provided much entertainment until 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with "zombie" in the title, but I would advise you to skip this.
