First, I must admit that it is not a good film. I will never see this film if Pacheco is not there. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the strange 24 hour publicity work. Like personal at all. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you might fall asleep. I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this terrible film. Just because of money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am a Pacino fan, I bought this movie in 2002 "People I Know". If you have not bought it yet, do not think about it, it's just a waste of time.
