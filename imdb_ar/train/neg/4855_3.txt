I really wanted to love this film, but ended up bored and incredible. The first shot is a camera powered by a robot that moves toward a bomb and is naturally shaken. But the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even during the quiet, ironic moments of conversation. Do rented homes have run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was filmed on 16 mm does not help, because the entire film is grainy and unshakeable. <br /> <br /> Despite all the efforts Bigelow has made in vehicles and precision equipment, there are stark errors and enough contradictions that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A fire will not explode in a car after a single shot, and will not be extinguished as soon as it is extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher. <br /> <br /> There will not be a single Humvee going around Baghdad in 2004, but will be supported by other vehicles in the event of a malfunction or attack. - It is highly unlikely that you will be able to hit a rebel in the long term, as it is clear that the bullet is taken again to reach the goal. <br /> <br /> I think the bombs were brought to designated areas for disposal at or near a base, not in a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> The oil tanker attack was said to have taken place in the Green Zone, a very safe area with very few internal attacks. The area is mostly offices and palaces with a few dwellings, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warning of dark alleys and rebellious rebels. It is curious that James never faced a problem because of the funny tactic of making his comrades to each alley on his own, thus preparing an attempted kidnapping. <br /> <br /> - When talking about this, the three-man team is always filmed, clearing buildings, chasing insurgents, etc., even when there are dozens of soldiers there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does a team have to stare at a dead insurgent who comes out the window to discover that he is not rigging it? <br /> <br /> He objected to the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was in the relationship. I had no idea who the explosive ordnance disposal team was reporting, and there were no other figures to be embodied. These are the things that characters will know, so we must too. <br /> <br /> Many "surprises" and scenes are quite predictable. Yes, it is clear that the psychologist will have a problem with the Iraqis who are trying to move with them, that the choice of grain at home will be overwhelming, and that the driver you have chosen will not wait for you when you leave the car. Finally, there was almost complete lack of personality development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, and she is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. It is exactly the same at the end of the film. what is the point? <br /> <br /> If this is indeed the best film of the Iraq war so far, this is an unfortunate group. Just based on the half hour I saw, I recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.
