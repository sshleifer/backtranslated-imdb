what happened? "Doubt" had a lot of potential for being a great movie - but instead I stumbled across a simple plot pulling line that made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film achieved was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who did not deserve any nomination for the Oscars. Although it was not one of its best performances, it still gives a strong and honest personality to us which thrived through the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even the shiny screen legend can not save this movie from going down the hill. From the dull beginning, which did not have the strength or the punch - to the less convincing end, the film was really disappointing - especially because it offered a lot of possibilities by promoting it and trailers. It was clear that the director faced a problem with the simplicity of the plot and ended up with a boring film that went on for too long with too much speech and insufficient action. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the other Oscar nominations were less convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman made a good performance, he was not worth the Oscar. (Especially they left the shows just like Will Smith, at seven pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was a normal one. It was logical to be nominated for the Razi Award, and I'm sure she would have won a victor. Viola Davis made a brief but honest presentation, but the length of her performance made me wonder if the Academy should actually give her the nomination. <br /> <br /> In general, I think doubt is one of the most disappointing films in 2008. It was a movie mess with a lot of potential, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, who, though performing a staggering performance, does not do enough to save the film. *** / 10.
