(Very light spoilers, perhaps.) <br /> <br /> Usually you are a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this night. I had to turn it off before 2pm because I found myself without sympathy for his daughter or mother. The two found themselves self-absorbed with little attention to others, adding the girl also rude and disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the girl died, the only thing I thought was "At least we will not have to see her anymore." Keaton did a good job of moving to her state of mind and sadness, but it was too far away for me at the time. I simply did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care about the hero, you need to take care of the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Support The actors were sincere and played well - I felt them *! * - The best gay boyfriend was wonderful, but even combined, it was not enough to carry the film out for me.
