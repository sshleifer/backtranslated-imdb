We have a lake. Our animated meteor crashing. We have a killer dinosaur to stop movement with fins. OK, so let's call this THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What can we add? They, idiots called Arne and Mitch to define the final definition of "comic relief". We also got a sheriff who does nothing in this film and does not listen to anyone. Hey crap, we have finished the middle of the film and we enter a bad man! Do not worry, let's show someone a mustache, ask him to steal a store to point out that he's a bad guy, then let him pop up somewhere near the lake and make him chase through the forest and all this for the sole purpose is to end up as dinosaur snack food . This should work. <br /> <br /> A complete, clumsy mess, this movie. The area will change your mind to force laughter to come out of you. The first film features Dave Allen's "Stop Motion Supervisor". After that, he joined the band Charles Band for several years until the mid-1990s, when the band ran out of money to pay him, I think. The effects of witch dinosaurs and the whole movie are very funny unintentionally. Unfortunately, this is about the only good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> Bad bad? Yes really. The logic of mental bending in narration must be sufficient reason to include it in the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
