In the glory days of the nineties (May God have mercy on him), you can play the great central comedy at any hour of the day and watch the biggest comedy show of all time from Saturday Saturday Live. Whpat is a great show, whether it's the original players who are not ready for the championship or SNL's second Golden Age, which includes the greats - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, and David Speed ​​... and then everything went to hell. I was first exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I should have gotten out of the shock. How can a terrible show prevail for a long time? There are lots of terrible flaws. I suppose I'll start writing. Writing, for the most part, is awful. It's no more than a humorous bathroom. Cast, for the most part, unambiguous. There are some graphics that I enjoyed, such as some Mrs. Swan and Stuart, and there are a few talents in the show such as the wonderful Alex Borstein. Phil Lamar is a talented actor, not just a comedian. Although there are a few moments of ha ha, they are not enough to retrieve this infinite line of horrible driving set inhabited by the stupid of the bad guys. Miss this one.
