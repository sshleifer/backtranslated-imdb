Maybe this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the ugliest American malice. Worse than the glamor - Mariah Carey slams America with par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer were dealing with huge quantities of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot I thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is a great nonsense from the devil's own bowels (which might have been a better script if he had put it in his mind). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, who spends our taxpayers' money (lottery money funds) on this nonsense, must be responsible. Who would think on earth that it would be a good idea to restart Deathline ?? I ask you - camp as a Christmas tree, Deathline ... The classic "mind doors" of a very bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. Sure, we do not need a poor, second class, bad script, bad development, and bad garbage like this. All this from the UK funding agency that brought us the lives of bodies of potato men ... and rest of my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay any money to see it. It's huge and absolute - the only saving grace for producers is that they got a huge wedge of money ... our money ... to make it. They must hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at the low and low level of this film. Mgr makes me that the National Film Support Association really thought it deserved support. There is no hope for the British film industry while the idiots run the show. Harvey Weinstein Where are you? Come back, Namsach !!!
