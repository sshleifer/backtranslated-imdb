Just under the surface lies what? The horror film is simply what it is. <br /> <br /> As other viewers have commented justifiably, the sequence of the storm is just ridiculous. Already burning firewood in heavy rain? Now this is clever. A threat? Nazir? Sexual tension? For those who read boring and fatigued, boring, blocked, overworked, and overly overbearing. <br /> <br /> I want to say thank God for a pleasant Mia Shower scene, but in the past, I think the producers of the movie, after they saw what was completed, realized the chaos they had to put something to make it halfway worthwhile at all. So it becomes just another competitor. Do yourself a favor and give this a miss.
