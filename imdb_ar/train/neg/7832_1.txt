I barely made it through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was padded and worth crawling down the right. It was a tragic representation. Ion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be exciting, is still mostly expressionless. His treatment points to the recent Botox treatment. Claire Furlani could have played just as well as playing the girl in an ordeal in a silent film. The characters were caricatures, each playing the role of stereotyping in the plot, mostly random. Special effects can be exempted for Cheesy due to budget TV budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise by distracting the cinema add to the lack of desire. I felt that the end was supposed to be brilliant and surprising, but it was lame and had nothing to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare the overall quality with something else, I would put this episode of "nightmares and dramascape" on par with Hercules NBC.
