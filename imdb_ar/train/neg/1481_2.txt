Have they used their entire budget to pay porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and editing were generally very poor, and you think some of the 12 year old will be a movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good given the scenario ... "innocent virgin" played its part well. <br /> <br /> Truly awesome mutants and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel ... but, alas for all concerned, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Turn Left was better than this movie and these guys did not even have any money! Good thing I did not rent the movie myself!
