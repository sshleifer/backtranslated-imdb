I'm not surprised that cowboys get the blues if this movie is away. I was expecting something better than Uma Thurman, which is why I suffered from this experience in the first place. Horrible movie with music only as a replacement quality. It's a shame that we are unable to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
