Whatever the meaning of his "message" - this movie is a terrible train wreck - terrible work, and a lame camera - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to pull stutter - it's lousy. You see the additions on the DVD and the way you follow the camera - it just absorbs it - it likes to be the center of attention. He is a bad actor - reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Somehow Carr showed this film in the city's youth centers and New Age churches - affected people looking for reinforcement and attention to themselves are affected by how the film is affected - and perhaps it happened - but as the film itself, it is intermittent and predictable green.
