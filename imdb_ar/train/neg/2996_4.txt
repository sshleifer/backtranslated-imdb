Born again is a substandard episode of the first season. It deals with reincarnation and just does not fly. I have never been great in reincarnation, and this may be part of the indifference towards this episode. They indicate the status of Tooms that are some nice continuation of the previous episode. But the pros end there. This is unfortunate because it happens at the beginning of the loop. I think it is ironic that a dead man chooses to be embodied in the body of a girl who has nothing to do with it. She is waiting for her 8-year-old to begin retaliation. There is even a serious lack of intelligent dialogue Mulder & Sculley to keep the ring on his feet. If you have reincarnation, this loop may be off. If you are not, at least you can know what a slow heart is.
