What happened in the film industry so it ended up being a complete mess? Just one year after "The Breakfast Club", a wonderful film with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire" (who by the way looked and acted in the last film as if they were still unfit in high school from before but without a fist Or discipline in portraying their roles. <br /> <br /> Whether it was the direction or the writing, the same person (Joel Schumacher) should be both, but then Schumacher gave us "The Phantom of the Opera", "Phone Booth "" A Time to Kill ", and two Batman, Batman and Robin and Batman Forever movies ranging from good directing to great directing." Something wrong with "StEF" because it has no genius at all, no comedy Well worth a Something that is far from the true value of life. <br /> <br /> Example: Wendy's character (a rich little girl with a heart to do the good and the less fortunate help played by Mary Winningham) reveals to Billy (a passionate Slob who betrays his wife and his friends, Drinks too far uch and has no sense of order in his life played appropriately by Rob Lowe) she is still a virgin.Biley really see a challenge and the possibility of conquest but Wendy is "not ready". Wendy, actually not ready so it's hard to believe she's in a clique of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, who was left by his wife by taking his daughter and marrying another, somehow picked up some threads of his life together. Billy leaves for New York, abandoned and abandons all parental responsibility for his infant daughter, persuading Wendy that her virginity will be the perfect "gift of departure" from her. Wendy, who works as a social worker to help broken families, seems to be not being gradually eliminated by this tyrant. Give me a break. The only thing she can offer only once, she gives the loser who leaves his family and friends? Schumacher puts this scene as a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There are many examples of this where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and value being put abroad and actions are taken to look like virtue. I suppose some might say that "this is the 80s" but I remember that in the '80s, men began to take responsibility for children who had children both in marriage and out of the house. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very bad because it is not exactly synchronized with its value and its correctness. <br /> <br /> As for the technique (not the story), it was terrible like well. It is detached and feels like a 3-hour film edited for an hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. Pick up what's on the editing room floor, set it up, and the film is likely to flow better ... but it's still a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Schumacher may have become a better and stronger director since 1986 (should have been) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing St Elmo's Fire script or maybe this group of actors took over the group and went their own way - this What I really think happened.
