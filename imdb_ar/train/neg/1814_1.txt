All these reviewers immediately. I have seen many bad movies over the years, believe me, this beats a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not just a waste of "too bad it's good" is a waste of time, but it's funny and real fun, terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Check out the type of white furry monster! <br /> <br /> Laughing at yourself in Thom Christopher's "Spell Wax"! <br /> <br /> GAPE at SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! In threadbare groups! <br /> <br /> This is one of the "common European productions". No wonder we have a lot of wars. I swear that some people who participate in the "Lost Kingdom Processors" do not really realize that they are appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! I watched this movie originally on HTV Wales late one night while I was suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to follow the copy several weeks later to make sure it was really bad. it's a. Worse still, Lee Majors in "The Norsman," a much droller of all John Derrick films, is truly a citizen of the trash.
