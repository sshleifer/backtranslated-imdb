This will be modest in Hollywood, if he has a good edit. It depends on the typical American excitement plot - "Who will win everyone". The representation is below average, but with the shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film he is mostly responsible if the tension increases in the film. The film was strangled completely by video and empty audio seems to most of it looks like a raw material for movies. All in all, if you do not mind watching a movie like a student's movie project, it's a movie to watch. I think that would be enough to say in this film, everything else can spoil the tension that may be low enough.
