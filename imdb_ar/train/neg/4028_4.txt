That was all that a very good film made - good actors (Robert Loggia and Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious rocket from space threatening to burn the planet) and many stock shots (if the Air Force had the movie the rockets fired, it was used). Unfortunately, it is destroyed because of a lot of melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film is related to a Soviet-launched space missile that inadvertently turns into a low-altitude orbit. At less than five miles and at speeds greater than 4,000 miles, it emits up to a million degrees and burns everything on Earth, including glaciers, DEW and Eskimos bases. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first flaws in this film are shown early. While we do not expect a lot of low budget movies, we can not forget some things - like a little research. For example, both the Soviets and the United States launch anti-ballistic missile missiles that are placed on the missile very accurately. However, the first successful ABM tests were not carried out until March of 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romantic relationship with a lot of firewood such as the wooden cabin. Barker's character shouted boos at Logia's sacrifice as if she were on a screen test. Logia is as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Philip Payne) proves him a lot and makes William Schattner seem like an accelerator. Bus driver spits down at the end of the world nonsense in the scene after a scene. The only good actor is the film's narrator, who plays veteran actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this can be overlooked if not for the timeline. After sending the rocket information to the capital, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. General (Larry Care) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After that, there are discussions among scientists and there is a deadly lull where a word is being sought from the ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the Russians and whether the response is necessary. <br /> <br /> The military movie shows are being completely scrambled. Civil defense personnel leave work and go to their posts. Eight million people flock to bomb shelters while school buses pick up millions of children (and see the whitest city of New York I have ever seen, although watching 50 science fiction films made it seem like this was the norm). The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the above happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Logia thinks somehow of how to stop the alien rocket. It slowly produces a plutonium, loads it into a jeep and takes it from the capital to a remote missile base to position it on a rocket. Along the way, a ground driver drove him out of the road, collapsed and was kidnapped. Finally, he retrieves plutonium and leads to the base to arm the missile. Again, all this in the same 63-minute timeframe. <br /> <br /> The film also raises scenes by making it look like Ottawa may be saved, just to show the roasting of men, women and children. The rocket is said to have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving to the base (4 miles to go). Up to the base and arm the missile, then the countdown is announced for two minutes. All within five minutes. New York neighborhoods should have been burned at least. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile was destroyed if you had not guessed. ABM warheads destroy it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. After five seconds, the explosion is shattered and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion of 100 Hiroshima on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The movie had all the elements needed to make a good movie, but it was lost. Loggia played his character very painfully, did not even care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You did not care about other characters, or even the fun world of Pine. The tension that could have moved the film was not really possible within the allowed time frame (not so today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been issued by any means and for good reason. I do not know if the film means it is or is a normal practice, but there is a scene where the government sends the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are so valuable that they can not be lost. There is not one woman or a minority in the group. Harry Rhodes is the only black man in the film and gets a short role in the piano. Was worse than the "27 days" where the alien gives five sons Earth the opportunity either to save or destroy the planet and does not include any black or Hispanic. <br /> <br /> I've seen this special night in Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect to show up again. If you find a copy of this somewhere, you may want to put it on Amazon.com.
