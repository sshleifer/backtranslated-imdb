George P. Cosmatos "Rambo: The first part of the second blood" is to achieve full desire. It is clear that the United States did not win the war in Vietnam. They have caused damage to this country beyond imagination, and this film continues in the fictional story of innocent soldiers. The only bad guys are the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. Rambo character is perfect for notice this. It is very patriotic, American Americans do not feel the appreciation and achievements of the only soldier, but he does not trust the senior officers and politicians. Like every film defending the war (like "We Are Soldiers") this film also avoids the need to give a reason to participate in South Asia. That's why every US-American soldier was there. Instead, Rambo gets revenge for the wounds of an entire nation. It was better to work on how to deal with memories, rather than suppressing them. "Will we win this time?" Yes you are.
