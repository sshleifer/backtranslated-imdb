This movie is awesome. The script is bad, an average script, and even sex scenes are worthless. Totally lacks the excitement and intrigue of the original film. This film was filmed in a dark, monochromatic style ("World War"), which is very frustrating after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrissey's character in the brood shows the expression of one face throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot lack the sorrow here; the few existing are simply counter-influence. The most striking feature of Sharon Stone is the performance of Catherine Tremel, and she continued faithfully in this sequel, but it is not enough to compensate for other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which the "core instinct 3" must be is that Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
