Beginning with the poster (which featured only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire film was a scam. One stereotype after another, this film was nothing - or nothing new at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J skipping their way through another cop click. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around the corrupt system of some city, all backed by a secret of the backbone business and in the city, under the watchful eye of some hot politicians. Called the competent organization and above the law FRAT and guess what? They got a crazy policeman shooting and beating at will - the suspects, the girlfriends, you name it. The professional policemen are corrupt and greedy, so they end up committing the mistakes of a talented young journalist (!!!). One hour later, after a series of poorly produced shooting scenes and more typical lines, everything ends happily and we get the final line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes!
