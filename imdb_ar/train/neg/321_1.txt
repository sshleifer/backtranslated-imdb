Shecky, is the damned legend of God, do not make mistakes. Until recently, I worked in the retail chain HiFi & Video in the UK and manage their test department. We will engage many new beginners and are expected to learn how to make mistakes in finding the different residues that are somehow non-functional from the stores. Now for Torto ^^^^^ To test the design of these new employees, we will issue them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because when someone who bought a particular model from the Goodmans DVD player who had the movie as a free gift bought it, they sent their DVD player back and did not fail to send Shecky again. Our new employees will only have to use the Going Overboard program to test these devices for faults until they find a disc or two of their own to test with. <br /> <br /> Now, why has this movie become so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be so, must be very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or Wedding Singer, hell on a holiday. The rest of the Stank crew, and what is with Billy Zain? His name appears in many of the worst films of all time and is a good actor. crazy. Production quality is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would have tended to give this zero if possible, because they did not even have the courage to call it the full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz 'in case of launch." However, it is worth watching so you can see how far Sandler to what extent can go.
