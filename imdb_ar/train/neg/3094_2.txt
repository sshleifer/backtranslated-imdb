**** MINI SPOILERS *** As a bad film tamer, I have to watch hundreds of bad movies, however, the "Hobgoblins" stand away from all the other movies in a unique way. Classic villains like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins", on the other hand, start badly and gradually become worse as it happens. During my first viewing of the scene of the infamous rake fight, I thought to myself that this was a really bad film. I did not know happily that I had just seen the best of what the film had shown. The film takes the most divisions into the hell of celluloid during the painless "Club Scum" sequence, which is a continuous series of non-fairy-tale jokes. With this film, director Rick Sloan proves that he deserves mention alongside Coleman Francis and Bill Ripan as one of the worst directors ever. How bad can a movie be? See "Hobgoblins" and no wonder anymore.
