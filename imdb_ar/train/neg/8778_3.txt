The White Noise was potentially one of the most talked about movies since The Exorcist I think. Seeing EVP is true supposed to be a really easy pass to be a real fact feared. There are not a lot of films that sow fear in the minds of people. As I said this movie can be, but did not. The film deteriorated itself into a scary PG-13 class low class. Nothing compared to the "ring" or "sixth sense" by any means. Someone really needs to take charge of making horror films only and making a film that not only makes us think, it makes us jump and scream and everything a horror film has to do. I am frankly a patient of the PG-13 Horror, because it has become a special thing. We need the old days, the days of blood and injustice, the days of Freddie Kruger, Jason, the Mike Myers. Some films can think that this mentality is not scary. Why did he try to withdraw him? Some good jumps in this movie are just one of the stupidest endings in the history of the film without any accuracy at all ... Do not waste your money on this movie.
