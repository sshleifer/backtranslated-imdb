Oh, my brother ... After hearing about this funny film for many years, all I can think of is that the old song of Peggy Lee .. <br /> <br /> "Is that all?" ... I was an early teenager when I hit this smoked fish US I was too young and I can not get into the theater (although I managed to sneak into the Columbus Farewell). After that, a film was shown at a local film museum - finally, I could see this film, but I was older than my father when they were floundering to see it !! <br /> <br /> The only reason behind this film was not sentenced to the sand of unknown time was because of the issue of obscenity raised by the launch in the United States. Millions of people came to this stink, believing they would see a sex film ... Instead, they got a lot of disgusting Swedes, street interviews in nice shopping malls, and ostentatious political demonstrations ... and the weak who care about simulated sexual scenes with Small, pale representatives. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, Holy Grail and historical artifacts ... Wherever this thing is, shredded, burned, then put ashes in the lead box! <br /> <br /> The aesthetics of the elite still pile up to find value in its boring, revolutionary political perfumes. But if it were not for the censorship scandal, it was ignored and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the title "I Am Blank, Blank" has been repeated indefinitely for years as a title for pornographic films (I Curious, Lavender - For gay films, I Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films , Etc.) and every ten years or so the thing arises from the dead, to be seen by a new generation of suckers who wish to see the "naughty sex movie" the film industry has evolved ... <br /> <br /> Yeesh , Avoid such a plague ... or if you must see it - the video is rented and soon made to the "dirty" parts, just to get it. <br /> <br />
