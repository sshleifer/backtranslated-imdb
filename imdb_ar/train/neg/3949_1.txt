I got a DVD from "Bogeyman" and this was an amazing additional feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was associated with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes the "ass" of "u" and "I". I had read before watching that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that he starred as a love actress. While watching "Boogeyman's Return", I decided to walk around in the original footage to see the famous toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the film was over. Rawag. I think I thought that this is BII because this has a title similar to one of the alternative BII titles. Well, at least that was an added advantage, was not it? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the film's mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes. Who does this man do whatever he thinks he is? Do you really believe that the movie itself will sell in different formats. There is nothing original holding the third part up. It's basically an original version of the original through psychic eyes, which provides us with a horribly boring game while everything happens. This is the film. Oh, the stereo scene of death, but you can read it from someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is missing forever. <br /> <br /> Last note: This is not a series of movies to watch again.
