I will be frank and to this point. This film is not good at all. The first part of the film hates acting, script, story, direction and almost all editing. Amanda Pitt proved she could act, as she was a high point in "every nine yards". So she had to avoid this movie by ten feet. However, the childish part of me found this film very funny. If you can forget how good the production is, and if you find that funny jokes funny, you should be fine. For those of you who can not get off your substrate, this is your choice. My inner child did not die, and I laughed a little. Even so, only 3 out of ten, because as a film, it is already stinky.
