I saw this in the hope of discovering something I did not know about the most notorious man in modern history and I could not think of rewriting Hitler's history: the rise of evil. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to get one of her admirers. Hitler appeared with a pistol in his hand to arrest Ernest Romme. Let me ask, but did not the book confuse Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana of Scarface? This is bad enough but what really bothered me is that there are full parts of the historical context missing in this mini-series. Germany lost World War I and allied forces made Germany pay a heavy price to do so. It was this economic environment that prompted the German people to have someone - anyone - to regain their pride and that is why they became Nazis. It seems that German humiliation in the 1920s caused by the allied forces is completely lost, so there is no way to Hitler's ethics: the rise of evil can be considered seriously as a historical document, and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and Guerring are visible because of their absence. One positive point about the mini-series is Robert Carlyle's starring role. Well, some of his actions are wrong and his voice is too high (archive records show that Hitler had a seductive voice) but Carlyle is an attractive actor who manages to deliver Hitler's charisma on the screen. Comments in the British press that resemble Carlyle a synth of Sparks more than Adolf Hitler are unfounded and give one of Hitler's best explanations. <br /> <br /> I liked Robert Carlyle's performance but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why it was made on the ground in the first place. There is nothing I recommend to lovers of serious history
