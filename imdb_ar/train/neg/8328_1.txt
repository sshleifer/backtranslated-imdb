If you want to see a film that was filmed strangely, strangely lit, and strange stories of these guys (and one woman) who enjoy fooling each other, if you want to enjoy a story that does not result in these two people, one boxer and the other a man like me, then You should see this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I felt a severe bruising, bleak and cut, like the film director himself beat hell from me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is not meant to see any great plot or representation, it is a film disguised in horror and wondered. Much like watching a plane crash or train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even an average movie, this is not the movie. <br /> <br /> Warning to all who watch this movie, please do not eat in advance. You may want to vomit at the end of the movie.
