I have just received evidence that confirmed my doubts. A group of 14 to 22 year olds on Titanic's DVD in a state of the art home entertainment show. Only two of them have already seen it before. But they all saw the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the saga began, they began to worry, leaving some asking others - "Contact us when the iceberg appears" for an hour and a half in the film, only the two girls who had seen the film before, were still there. They started yelling: an iceberg, an iceberg. Following the stampede, they all returned to see Titanic sinking. They sat open mouth, emitting mothers and distant. So, just as I thought when the film first broke into the scene. What is that? An hour and a half waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of it. Dr. Zivago, for example, had a similar operating time, but thought about how much this film would take during the same period of time. In Titanic, Liu teaches how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of C la de la creme supposed cream in the first class dining room in the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The film's story is so high that they have to deliver weapons and fire in a ship about to sink. Real drowning here is the film's standards. All efforts focus on special effects and weekends. The film continued to be the highest movie of all time, so what do I know?
