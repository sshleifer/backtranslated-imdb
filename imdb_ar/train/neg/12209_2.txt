Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my friends and my brother had both a policy to pay the person who chooses the film. Although I would not pay for seeing some of the nonsense they took me, I could not resist a free trip to the cinema! So I came to see crap like the movie Conan II and I say again! Now, despite being a miserable film, it is in amusing places to watch it - in a dead brain way. Technically, stunts and camera work are good, so this raises my rating to 2! So why is the film so bad? Well, unlike Rambo I, this film does not have any plot, Rambo himself says about only 3 words (other than batons and yelling), there is an unnecessary and irrelevant "love story", and the film is a stupid giant one . The special effects of stupidity are wonderful. While shooting 12383499143743701 on Rambo, none of them have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow called Rambo blows! While the bad guys used the AK-47s and helicopters and rockets, in some scenes Rambo had all the bow and arrows with what sounded like nuclear powered tips! The scene in which a bad person shoots him as he slowly and quietly releases one of these explosive darts specially made for stupid spectators! It was a wonderful irony in the UHF Championship Al Ghorba. In addition, hot clips and PART DEUX show a funny parody of this genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very stupid and useless film, it's like a parody!
