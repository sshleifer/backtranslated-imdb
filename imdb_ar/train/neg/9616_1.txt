At first, I had only doubts when looking at a DVD and reading it, saying it was a bunch of teenagers gathering in a lake where they find or do something. Any film that has such a hypothesis has failed miserably, even if it is a feature film, except for the first Friday. <br /> <br /> I wanted to wake up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I kept thinking it had to get a bit better. he did not do. Usually, I think every movie has something you can take from it. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a good service, and look for something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself papers of paper, or eat dirt.
