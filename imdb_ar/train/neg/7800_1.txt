Apart from the cheap dirt, it was difficult to access this video-filmed exercise in a state of uncertainty. You've got the usual heaviness you'd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the atmosphere required to make it worth it. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that this is a German amateur video, and the first version is the English Mdbalij! Fans seem to be American fans (defenders of the Germans!) Who can not decide whether they want to play straight or turn it into a comedy. There is one person (a white German, of course) named by a seemingly black man, talking to a dense ebony! "Be the most important sayin", Comrad?
