First of all, what is good in the film? Some beautiful actress? Exotic background? The fact that actors do not laugh during acting (I'll be if you're in their position)? I do not know, I do not know. The story is simple: A Catholic priest tries to paint a abstract painting that tells the story of the other abstract artist who killed his little brother, a male whore (another priest raped him when he was young ...). I am afraid that there is nothing here to learn or allow to think a bit about armed killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode in the worst season of "profiler" (the series) with two alternate representatives and incredible coincidences (Uncle is the policeman who can live in another victim's home to have a child with the priest, etc., etc.).
