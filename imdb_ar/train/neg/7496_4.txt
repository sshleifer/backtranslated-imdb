It is hard to bear in mind the very strange hatred I have about this film. But I will try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was obscene, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and stereotypes were beyond the norm, if not offensive to Italian Americans. I'm not saying that acting was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody and Espisito et. Al, perform well. But ... almost every character in the film despised. Not since the fires of vanity caught in every figure on the screen.
