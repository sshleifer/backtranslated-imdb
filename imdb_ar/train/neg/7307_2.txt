Maybe this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Events in it are completely random and meaningless. The fact that there is a very annoying supplement has been a case of cabin fever (I'm very sorry). I describe it as a mistake in a newspaper because it seems like different parts of things are mixed together. For example, Kevin, a karate-loving baby of pancakes, is very odd on his own, then there is a somewhat bizarre and perverted policeman, then a drug addict, then there is the fact that they are attacking someone indiscriminately and clearly needs help. Then suddenly, the main character is having sex with his girlfriend girlfriend just because she says something stupid about landing the plane. Then in the end some good racism of the old family followed by a rabbit working on Kevin Kidd karate. It is so despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Elie Roth, so that did not make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word but seeing it as the only word I'm allowed to use, should do. Kapin County fever 2 !!!!!
