Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleeping morgue, and the light fades quickly. If not for her, for any other reason to see this. Five university students were registered to prepare an old house for the date of its demolition. Problems occur automatically when a homeless man asks for a stranger, and the group is short of people. Then, the killer is in the loose. I honestly wanted to say that I would enjoy it. She had a fair group, or maybe it was just Zuniga Daphne in it. The film is very slow, and almost silent like the library. Most representation is below average, and moments of "view" are very old news. Famous composer Christopher Young of films such as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" recorded this, in a frequent cue line it is best to make a television movie. However, it looks higher than the film deserves. Therefore, unlike Young and Zuniga, this person is eliminated down the barrel.
