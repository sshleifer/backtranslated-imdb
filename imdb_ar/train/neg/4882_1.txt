There are some bad movies out there. Mostly fun to some extent. "Criminal 1 Crazy" was one of those clicks. He was so bad that he was fun and re-watched him. "Criminally Insane 2" should be one of the worst movies I've ever produced, and that's a lot because I'm not the kind who says anything is the worst. But trust me, this was quite bad and took only one hour for one hour. <br /> <br /> The film has a somewhat incoherent story, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a fat woman around her killing people because she does not feed. Well, do not see it in this movie, except for all the flash sequences of the first buck. The new narrative could have been really funny since Ethel was sent to a halfway house and killed everyone in it, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the film and at this point you are already falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera working in this movie is just awful. This reminds me literally of something I picked up with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is another thing because you can not understand the word most of the characters say. To give an example of how bad the situation is, go to the New York subway and try to understand what is being said about loud speakers, and that's what this movie looks like. It does not matter what they talk about anyway because the actors are as dry as pieces of dead wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying this is the worst film there is too harsh but words can describe how bad this film is. If you do not believe me, see for yourself. 10/01
