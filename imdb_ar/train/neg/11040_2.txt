You need to watch this show once to watch them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something in a good way, but it bothers his wife, and in the end she realizes that what he did is really for her, she cares about his cheek and gives a smirk while looking gaily. In fact, the story lines are so lame and complex that I will take one stab now. <br /> <br /> "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jims' wife notes that Jims all week paid off, then explained that he lost her at the casino. She screams and leaves the house skeptical of his horrors. Then on Valentine's Day, he appeared in a limousine with tickets to attend one of the balls (and then explain the lost wages). She realizes the mistake of "her" and usual "Hey Jim, you are so beautiful." .. The End <br /> <br /> Another very obvious element is the fact that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson, who can character the cartoon to escape from being aggressive and ignorant, when this is done with human beings does not work and Jim only comes on As a self-centered jerk. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason for the success of this is simply because we are now many in terms of humans with TVs, these days you can make a presentation about a man isolating walls and you want to get an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other hand are wonderful and fun.
