Why in the world does someone make this piece of film? The first two films of Zombie Bloodbath were stupid enough, but this takes the cake for the worst trilogy (perhaps all the time). Todd Sheats is still the director, but he is no longer a screenwriter, and he is not negative or positive, given that he is as talented as the man who wrote this. Writing strongly depends on the word f, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times in nausea. Acting is on par with two other Bloodbath films, so of course, it is some of the worst I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godawful. The plot became too complex because it was good, and it was about the failure of some government experiments and zombie production. It is also characterized by a mutated zombie zombie and school children who know how to travel over time, leading to one of the most stupid endings I have ever seen. After the film goes outtakes, it is strange because this whole film is outtake. See this just for fun, because if you go into this with a serious mind, you may kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
