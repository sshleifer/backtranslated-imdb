Well, I saw this movie for the first time at 9:00 am on Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought it would be the winner. This one bit big movie. I mean that the mother of monsters does not show its true form only at the end of the film. I'm going "That's why I do not show up a bit more briefly earlier in the film." The plot of being a mother and her son is a feast on the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they just went on, you know, a murder spree kills like a couple of young women, then you know a police chief or a policeman and an old man find a way to kill monsters, save a young woman, and kill 1 or 2 other people in the process ? I think it would be hell much better this way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and he kills first. Why not get rid of the mother first? In addition, how does this force at the end of the film when you start killing people? She herself was very weak. What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, ever, act in any film by any actor, after all, they do their best. If it is not good, this movie has been given 1/10. 10/03.
