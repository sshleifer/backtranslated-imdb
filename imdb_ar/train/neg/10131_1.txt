Well, I can finally put an end to the question: "What's the worst film ever made?" It is a flight of anger, starring and co-authored by Steven Seagal. Sure, there are lots of famous bad movies, but this movie takes the cake because it takes itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian-made film about how far Romania should go with Bollywood. He also talks about how Steven Segal is completely free of reason and talent. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after seeing it and need to stand in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing makes you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was only released on the video (I can not imagine the reason) and I suspect that the workers who had to make the DVD had to wear protective equipment and receive regular advice.
