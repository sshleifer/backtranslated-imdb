When I saw it in a shop, I thought it looked good and original. Like Wolves Creek, I meet a Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which means that it costs only three wages (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> It seemed like directors - the Brothers of the Butcher could not decide whether they wanted to do some kind of horror or a deadly farce. It ended with a sadistic hour full of excitement, and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you can not care what happened to them, but in an attempt to make the audience care about the characters who added useless platforms in the end and there was no need to start the film to be completely honest. <br /> <br /> The only good part is really the middle / end - I will not ruin it for you. But this was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a useless hour. It looked like a two-hour film, but it was only 75 minutes. If you want a film technician, do not bother. If you want a movie that is tilted - do not care - the movie moves very slowly without anything happening.
