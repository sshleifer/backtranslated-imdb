This film revolves around a group of black gay men outside who are killing females on the ground, in order to create a gay world. <br /> <br /> I saw him in order to see how bad the situation was. Still, I was shocked by how bad it was. It looked like a film made 50 years ago. Representation, if any, is very bad. The kits and props are very fake, making any film collectors look like a huge budget. The special effects are disgustingly simple, but they really fall off as others have commented, but the jaw is very awkward. If I were from Denmark, I would feel very embarrassed and humiliated because my compatriots produced a very bad film.
