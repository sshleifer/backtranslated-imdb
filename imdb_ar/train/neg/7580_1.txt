This movie was awful. Basically, Jean Marsh was a North Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible to US troops in South Korea. She has become a maid to a US military family, all of which she considers Korean although she looks more white (I think the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asia, not Korean at all), and the little boy begins to hate her and end up sleeping. The way Korea and the US military are portrayed in Korea is completely crazy. Of course, it is clear that the screenwriter and director of the white men who never spent in Korea before this film and had no intention of showing any real vision of life in Korea either Koreans or American military authors and instead tried only their pathetic fantasies of Asaphile without any Consider the extent of disbelief of the film. Anyone who has visited Korea at all will know that this is absolute garbage. In the end, a North Korean Hinheol spy girl is killed, in a way that "pays for her sins" clearly. Very bad movie with a sense of television.
