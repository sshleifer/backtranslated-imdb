The film was so bad, and I could hardly believe I was watching it. It seems that guidance, editing, production and scenario are all as if it had been implemented by high school students who did not know much about movies. There was no flow of narration making any kind of sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (such as an early one between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and personal relationships (such as those initially hinted at) do not come entirely in terms of not being prepared as if they were in a more elegant place and making the film effective. The characters lag behind unfortunately, making it difficult for us to communicate with them. Surprisingly, acting is not entirely bad, but terrible writing eliminates relatively convincing performances. The movie plays like T.V. West / Epic is very bad, and unfortunately reduces the wonderful (real) story that he tries to narrate. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as important to the Australians because of the subject. All this is very good, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical symbol does not make the film good. No one says that the subject is not good, but the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event for Americans, but that does not mean I'm going to defend the film and say it was good, because it's still bad. The failures are everywhere, though Heath and Orlando are nice to look at.
