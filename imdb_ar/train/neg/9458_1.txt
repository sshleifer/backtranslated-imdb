There are a lot of comments that have already been posted that show what I felt about this film, so make it short. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought it was great - Jim Carrey is a truly gifted and physically talented comedian as well as being a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs through annoying. I used to love him so much in the Days of Wynes World and "So I Married the Ax Killer" - but I was not fond of Austin Powers and "The Cat in the Hat" had finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - the gags were awful! Not only for kids, not just adult content but the fact that some of them were very dated, they did not succeed in entertaining anyone for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! It was really shameful because the children were very lovable as was the "mom". They may have chosen a better evil than Alec Baldwin - but he could have withdrawn if he was not for Myers ugly, passing an overly catlike image of Cat. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers even look at the script? Was it written one? Other actors seem to have one - but the cat seemed to be giving it up! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would mention that the groups and props were fantastic !!! Unfortunately, they could not save the film. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Suss - the man was a genius! Do not destroy his reputation by adapting his work in a lazy and chaotic way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
