I understand the desire to make a different animated film. I understand the comments of previous reviewers that this film was not understood. My point is that once this film was over, my first comment was: "This is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and does not have a talent." She uses her father's money to make a film that she wrote, directs, and pays for .... It is clear that getting closer to the film realizes that there has been no evolution in character and there are no directions such as beginning, middle and end ..... The voyeur part was good and energetic but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, look for some pictures, notice the discharge of the business, and go out on a cold night (unbelievable) to check out the noise, trampling her temporary lover .... The film ends ..... some educate my own Ignorant arss? I really want to know what the point is .... What were the directors seeing ..... Why is there no evolution for the dead lover? Why not background on the conduct of business? What is the purpose of night vision? What is the lipstick point on the car? Why the temporary care? Why did he tell us about a mental patient who escaped / Tom Peeping? What is with Jar? Oh and the lamp is supposed to indicate who is this house? Regional? why? Why would the charge d'affaires feel that he is his home? This aspect has never been followed ... for William Devoe ... I hired this movie because it was a well known and passionate character ..... Write again and tell me what I want to learn .. .. I'm just a Central American mother loves Movies .... Chris ....
