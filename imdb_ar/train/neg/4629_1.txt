It was clearly made to show the famous Mestre Aires talents of the 1950s. Too bad she can not act. <br /> <br /> A boring little tale about sedating the beautiful innocent Sally Down and forcing him into white slavery (prostitution). She then meets Tommy Cole who is in love with her instantly. He wants to help her escape but can he? You really will not care. <br /> <br /> There's no real skin here - Ayers is slowly getting into her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story of the horrible "comedy" full of vitality (I never thought prostitution was funny but what do I know?) And a terrible dialogue after dubbing. I admit there was a twist in the end that I did not find coming, but that's not enough to sit on. Also Ayers attempts at hysterical acting! A real bomb. Avoid.
