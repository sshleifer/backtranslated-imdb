Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn were turning in their graves if they knew that the guesswork that would come for dinner was actually in the theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton these four wonderful actors made a wonderful cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer in 1967. This day rip off a joke. So the white man from a very typical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend to the house (Insert GASP here) to the funeral of his great father. The reactions of his family members were of course .... predictable. This film was painfully written from start to finish, and my friend actually started fake snoring to indicate that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and hire the original. Take a pass on Wake.
