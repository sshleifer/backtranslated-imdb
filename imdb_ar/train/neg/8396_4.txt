... but I saw the best too. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - the film crew is trying to shoot a horror film in a place where the murders took place. Three guesses what is happening. This is not a complete bomb - cast is pretty good with the pros John Ireland, Faith Dumerge and John Carradine make the best offers. It's made well - for a low budget movie. Do not expect any nudity, section, blood or gore (the film has a very light PG rating). I never felt completely bored - it was good to see a quiet night. I saw it on the video - it was a horrible edition - very dark and it was impossible to see some of the scenes. However, I did not hate it and it has a wonderful ending that surprised me - nothing happened until then, so I realized it. Worth watching but only if you are a horror movie complete.
