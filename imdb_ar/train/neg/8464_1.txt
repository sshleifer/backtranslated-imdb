I'm very tolerant with science fiction movies and really bad horror movies - I've been watching them since I was 4 or 5 years old, so I've seen some really bad things, but I'm dealing with them. I've watched a lot of SciFi movies so I do not know I expect much - a promising film that never ends. I think hope stems forever, or the triumph of hope over experience, they say. Unfortunately, this dog from the beginning and I knew him, but I like the moth into the flame, I kept thinking about something, anything, will happen interesting. No. All representatives perform well - and given the scenario, I do not know how they all kept straight sides. It has to do with parasitic parasites that suffer from hunger and that slowly take over the human race, one body at a time. There is a wicked surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans ... Do not worry, he gets what he will come to. Dodd people do not really know where they came from, and they think they may be able to ride the meteors that landed on the ground, but ... somehow they know about the family members among them - Amira al-Douda was born with a man known to be the queen of the worm and she loves herself. Oh, should I continue? Please, I beg you, do not waste two hours of your life watching this ... Anything will be better ... Think about the worst and the least enjoyable way you can spend two hours ... would be better.
