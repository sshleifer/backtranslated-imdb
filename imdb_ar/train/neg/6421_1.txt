I am surprised by some reviews of this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is awesome. The plot is too lazy. It's not too scary. The people there who think so because the star Sarah Michelle Geller is somewhat similar to the hatred must forget it. This movie is similar to Dark Water, but it is more predictable and slow to move. I was very disappointed with this film. It did not scare me and I do not care either. Let's face it, this kind of conspiracies have been whipped to death at this point, for example the dead are trying to connect the living - dragonfly, what lies beneath, the ghost story, dark water, darkness, screaming etc. It seems to me that the only ones who write original horror movies These days are Japanese and Koreans. Movies that come out of Hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in making money without respect for the viewer. They're just being violently
