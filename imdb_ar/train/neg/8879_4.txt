I think Clive Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics dating back to his record. It's okay here as it is heavy, but the direction is very bad the pace of exhaustion, inseparable from the mark. The story begins well, though it makes me wonder how he can rely on his outstanding wife herself. The mugs is still well and holds things along. The bell of death is twofold. First of all, if we have to take the amount of time that characters spend walking from one room to another or part of the house to another, it will take about a third of the film. In addition, the character of Robertson sits in bed in the blue light, looks confused, and may add another piece. I agree with those who said that a half-hour short film would have made him a very fit film, though not important. The biggest weakness is a complex conspiracy, when everything is said and done, leaving incredible questions. I do not put spoilers, but when you're done, do not think too much. I could get ten if I did not race. It would have been better if it had been a ghost story.
