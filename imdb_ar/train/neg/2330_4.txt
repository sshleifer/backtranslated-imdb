I liked the way it started, with some special effects coming up especially for a 50-year-old film. There was some very impressive scenery. However, the film stumbles somewhat early with some very stupid dialogue where all males try to flirt with Ann Francis "Altaira Morbius.") <br /> <br /> This was introduced in the 1990s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has mostly broadcast television programs since the film was released .... and still works. It was also interesting to see young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not have known if it had not been the sound. <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire Go to sleep. I appreciate them re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. But it was a weak effort. This is an exaggerated film where "elites" think it is "heavy" and "thought-provoking". This is nonsense. It seemed "smart" just because the rest of the science fiction films of the 1950s were so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some of the early scenes look great on the widescreen, which I did not have at the time of writing this article. Maybe another look - this time on the 2.35: 1 widescreen move will make me change this review.
