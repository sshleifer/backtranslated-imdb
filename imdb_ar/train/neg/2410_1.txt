Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films that these guys have produced seem to have come together and portrayed this with their comrades who have no talent one afternoon when they are bored (the lines are not fully understood and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home videos are better than this film (although their similarities are worth comparing). "Hey lets you know if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movies!". Hope no one else. My apologies to those involved in the flic because this review is somewhat harsh but I was a drug who read your fake feedback and bought the movie.
