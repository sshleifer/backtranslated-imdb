The worst kind of film. Basically, the American Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen and this deceived the museum's security for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> A plasma screen that works theoretically for less than two seconds of a clock's battery, assuming it has enough internal resistance to provide the current, which will not happen. <br /> <br /> This will be possible with dozens of large car batteries and an inverter, but this system will not fit into the enclosure. Sorry to be an anal, but this is not close to being acceptable. The rest of the film was not much better, and I left wondering why it was not possible to donate the budget to charities or to me.
