I write this review after I saw it several months ago .... The lump seemed promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It is a complete joke ... and frankly verbatim in the face of the real classics of the first generation of horror like the Texas Shainsu Massacre (1974), which they even had the bitterness to compare against the background of the art of the cover. The product that played the role of Brandon must give up the burgers and eliminate the greasy hamburgers .... may not be good at that either! The bad lighting was bad and very disturbing by getting out of the movie, so you could not even see the actor's faces sometimes. I do not remember even the rest of the really sad team members, the bad they never did anything to convince you to make them unforgettable. This is all the time I will waste in this review, please stay as far away as possible from this scrap pile even if I got it for 25 cents, do not do it. Buy at least a piece of gum to keep you informed! If you want to have a good fun with a low budget, better than that ... Check out the movie Jeff Hayes .... because it requires talent to make it in horror and the child has! This star is only given 1 cover art .... this is the only thing worth admiring this name called "film" <br /> <br /> - Rick Block
