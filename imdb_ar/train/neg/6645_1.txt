This guy has no idea about cinema. Well, he seems to have made a number of interesting theatrical performances in his youth, and about two acceptable films that have been successful for political reasons to deceive communism. All this is very good, but look carefully: he does not know his work! The viewer is unbalanced, without an appropriate start and, with turbulent content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about it, so he is overly authorized by violence, nudity and the language of the gutter. How can you survive such a rotten corpse who did not understand anything from cinematography and art? Why do not they allow him to surrender?
