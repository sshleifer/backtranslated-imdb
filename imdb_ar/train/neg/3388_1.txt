I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I never saw the movie version until very recently on the cable, watched it eagerly, to see my memories come alive again, because I adore the original show. Imagine my displeasure. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst translation of the Broadway show of the films ever produced. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost the spirit. I was expecting a trip in the lane of memory, and sing to the extraordinary music and mirror, the ballet, the twelve Hulu, the fun and hi thirteen. Not! Not only did the music flirt with an almost unrecognizable point of view, but they spoiled the story, adding songs and external sketches (hi-cassie and Michael Douglas) that did not exist originally, and injecting the "drama" that was not necessary. The original had enough logos on its own. If you love the original Broadway show, do not bother. I'm sorry that I wasted my time, and relaxed my memory, watching this intestines.
