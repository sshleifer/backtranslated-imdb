Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly became widowed when his wife died. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Price, an expert on EVP, who claims to be receiving messages from Jonathan's wife, who left Anna via various electronic devices, phoned him. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this just a hint of something on a larger global scale or elsewhere? It is good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he faces is wrapped up and ironic at some points. It seems as if the film does not know how to answer any of the questions it poses, so distracts the viewer by asking new questions unrelated to them. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is very good, and convincingly widows are said to be desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He has matured somewhat as an actor, leaving behind the friendly wiki Hickins roles he played 15 years ago or so. It sounds a little noisy, with some of the wrinkles one might expect, but it has not lost any of the guilt and pain it has shown in a quarter of a century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So, it is not that Keaton turns into a mediocre performance, is that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it progresses, and each winding track ends in another hard track. All this is good and good if the path leads to a kind of acceptable cut, something that connects everything together or explains ... something. But not white noise. I did not know what happened to Jonathan more than I knew before I first saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is the only reason to watch this scrap, although he has received good support from Ian McNees (like Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Anger is the love interest required.
