I've seen a lot of Jay Madden films, and I loved most of them, but this movie gave me a real headache. John Gurdbeck's editing is very irritating, and apart from the wanderings of power displays a line of captures picked up to look at a single object, doing nothing but interfering with the ability of actors to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like about this film was that it looked more barbaric than the work of a previous debtor - though his films always contained dark elements, but his sympathy with the characters gave the films a sense of humanity. This seemed more like a cruelty. <br /> <br /> Since I am forced to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my rating, I will remember that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" does not manage the monkey's facial expressions well.
