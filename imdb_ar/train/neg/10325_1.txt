This series gets worse and worse. Badly written and just not funny! The hypothesis is excellent, but the writer's lack of experience is brilliant. By trying hard to hurt anyone who ends up insulting everyone. Now in the second season, the desperate staff stopped waving their arms and resorted to this vulgar elegance, "Oh, you silly" who behaves in a non-laughing way. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, Are not we an adulterer? Is not that funny? Well, no, that's not really. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come on CBC, which is supposed to be our flagship platform for the best Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
