This is the least scary film I have ever seen. How I managed the point of eating anyone is the biggest mystery in the film. The point moves very slowly so that the escape can escape under the zimmerframe. The blob has a large slice of luck encountered by a woman of typical horror films that instead of escaping still exist for half an hour until they can be eaten. If you've seen this movie, I recommend it, funny that it can not be taken seriously.
