Let's face it, romantic comedy is light when compared to dramatic films (see only Oscar nominations each year). But still, the good ones is really a technical form. See "When Harry met Sally", "No Sleep in Seattle", classics like "Roman Holiday" and "One Night". I like a good feeling of seeing two people heading to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to create something like a romantic comedy. But no one believes the romance among the main characters, and there is nothing funny to compensate for this great shortcoming. Moden is the way to become a leading man - especially the romantic leadership. I'm sure he's an executive producer, he had the means - but not the common sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see the potential of some comedy talent, but she did not have a sophisticated script and character. Who was his idea is English? useless. <br /> <br /> Others have said so, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly conceived and poorly implemented; miscast actors are terrible. And the characters, well, do not give voice to them. <br /> <br /> An art form is not. Go hire "Moonstruck" again.
