There were times during the movie I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason to carry the whole movie is that I could not believe how bad it really was and I think it should get better. This was really a horror film. I was terrified of wasting what seemed to me like 4 hours of my life and never going back. And the other two hours I spent mourning for the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and tell them that the thrill will kill them.
