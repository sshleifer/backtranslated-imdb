I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The representation was terrible and the plot ridiculous. I get the fact that the wife of the main character I left caused my mental breakdown, but it became silly and boring, after a while I could have been less interested in any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie continued over and over again on the same ideas without anything new or surprisingly added to the plot. The whole thing got a lot of Geiger counter after a period of Stuart's opening his wall to find out what was behind him after the meter indicated something was there. <br /> <br /> Then there were frequent scenes with a flyer, and confusing shapes where he meets himself. <br /> <br /> I had to guess that this film was a flop when I did not know which actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie comes, read a book! You will be better off.
