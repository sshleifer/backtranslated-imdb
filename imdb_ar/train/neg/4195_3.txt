In view of the people involved, it is difficult to know why the film was corrupted and boring. The writer, David Ward, wrote the stunning film "The Sting" two years later, and Jane Fonda just won the Oscar for Clout, and Donald Sutherland did an excellent job in films like Clotte, Start Without Me and Kelly Heroes. The film is certainly a huge story, with a small band of crooks who plan to steal big. At the same time, the film wants to be a huge satire, a series of comics of the kind that will be shown by NBC television program "Saturday Night" well after two years. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedies look embarrassing and embarrassing and the discrete comedies destroy any kind of thrill that may be stolen. It is literally a film that continues to smash in itself, just as the cars in the demolition scenes go with each other. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was watching Gene Fonda. Her film "Iris Caine" is supposed to be the opening of her character Bree Daniels in the film "Klute", yet no one believes her for a moment. Jean Fonda always pretends to be a whore watching her. It's a terrible performance like its performance in "Klute" was fantastic. It will be a good lesson for teachers who manage the two films together to show how the actress can be herself in the same kind of wonderful or pathetic roles. It indicates that the actors are only as good as their writers and managers.
