What can I say? I am a secret fan of horror films and horror films. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and hint, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three possible draws for this movie: ?? Comedy Mode; Horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes being from the plane. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a horror film in the tongue or comedy, and there is only one or two points in the film where you smile to yourself. If you want to feel the movie, the trailer is really scary. <br /> <br /> Second, if you expect a film full of motion and shocks, I will not be disappointed. Do not stand out above other movies, but they always get your attention. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, although Snakes of a Plane's novelty does not wear out, you'll leave the cinema thinking "What was all this trouble around". <br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not accumulate. A) Many reviews were written before the release of the film and, b) Detailed user ratings has a much lower contrast than the normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - Why this huge gap?
