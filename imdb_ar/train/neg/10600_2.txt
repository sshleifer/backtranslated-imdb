I will be honest. The only reason that made me watch this TV on the screen is that it is in the IMDb down 100. Now, I wonder if an hour and a half of my life really deserves another "check" in the same menu. <br /> <br /> Van Damme is Locke Defraux, who finds himself in a major fight with world soldiers after pulling the main computer "Hull" to defend himself. And yes, after all the blasts that bind, shooting and chasing is another stand. In conjunction with terrible representation and a bit of boring setup, it makes sure it is a place in the infamous list only. <br /> <br /> Just for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list. 10/02.
