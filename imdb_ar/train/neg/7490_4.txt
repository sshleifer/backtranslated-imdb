This film was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the ideal and fair public prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any defense lawyer or tried to challenge the audience with a meaningful and meaningful discussion on how a country could drop such a terrible course. <br /> <br /> Certainly, no one wants to defend the point of view of Nazism, but that was the point of Nuremberg! Four hours of simply hit on Nazism .... Come on! It has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should be committed only to Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the film ended, TNT introduced the 1959 film, Trail in Nuremberg. This film is a superior FAR.
