Diana is a young angry woman. Having escaped an unrelenting series of disappointments and shocks, she gets angry at the nearest targets. <br /> <br /> When you see violence shift and focus on discipline in a rundown boxing club, you know she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The film moves from there, where Diana learns the usual lessons of old age as well as the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at this role, especially when the center of anger transfer from a young woman overwhelmed by all aspects and fighting not only in personal circumstances but also against firm sex discrimination. <br /> <br /> The image may use some ingenuity in the direction of all young actors, who pale compared to older, cast more experienced. There is a lot of pause in the script, which detracts from extreme stress. The overall calm of the film is draining heavily. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture to see once, if only to know the strength of a fully realized young woman and her femininity is complex enough to include her strength. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the category of "seeing it again and again".
