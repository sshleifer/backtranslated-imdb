This is a very sad film. really. Nothing happens in this movie. The text is bad !!! I think they only copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Producers must have thought about creating a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week, only works in Antwerp and Brussels at 22:00 or anything. In the past, we had really good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shades is a waste of your time. Maybe you can sneak into the theater after watching a real movie. If you see 10 minutes of shadows, you have seen everything. They were announced to death on local radio and television. I hope to disappear in the shadows soon.
