A relentlessly stupid "picture of war", made primarily to show the stunning features of Eve Meyer - is not a bad idea in itself - but this must be embarrassing to everyone associated with it. A laughable "scenario", performances that will not succeed in a primary school Christmas contest, incompetent "movement" scenes, and the confused direction of the documentary director Louis Clyde Stommen - who seems quite unsure whether to make a comedy, The absurdity of the war or the exciting T & A (by the early 1960s, anyway) is a journey to the magnificent Eve Meyer body - and a general atmosphere of softness and inefficiency. It's worth watching to see Yves Mayer strutting her stuff, but that's pretty good.
