(Spoilers in this) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about women heroes in the time of German Nazism. But they are too long, they are not touching and sometimes they are boring! There are a lot of cliches and not enough good representation. <br /> <br /> Storytelling is bad. As in James Cameron Titanic, an old woman who remembers her life. Well, now we have a point of view. From there another woman presented who does the same thing. It's confusing that they both remember the lives of other people! Come on! This is the lack of knowledge of the story of the basic story ... How can Raiman know the fate of the mother of the girl and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> The viewer is displayed in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example the scene when Riemann proposes to Fabian. When did that happen? The scene looks like it was made in the 1920s ... <br /> <br /> Riman's character is of course a talented pianist, well, she's even the Baroness! Wonderful. Her brother returned from the Eastern Front and has received "Ritterkreuz" which shows him in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a good man who kept his conscience. He gained knowledge of the massacres committed by the Germans. I've made some pictures! Needless to say, that cliche after cliché build up and that's why the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Von Truta basically made a chick of something that could have been a decent film. In the end everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to introduce Goebbels to bed and da da! - All free. It is not a historical fact but a pure fantasy despite the claim of the "real story" at first. Such as "Sass", relies mysteriously on a real event. <br /> <br /> It is sad but real, this is the typical German film these days. it's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
