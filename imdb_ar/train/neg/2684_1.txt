The film found insulting Americans who lost someone in the towers, and Americans in general. Pretending to be a tribute to the terrible realities of last year, every director takes the opportunity to talk to the old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), criticize US political behavior, or compare the different political situation as in itself the country has nothing to do To do or to share with the horrific September 11. Shame on them.
