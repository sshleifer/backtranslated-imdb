This should have been a film about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk, and Olympia's glorious dachas. This was a film worth watching. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a little Falk being put up. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also present in this film, but you hardly know it. I assume that Reiser is under the impression that he is a giant film star who needs an appropriate vehicle. not him. What bothers us most is that Reiser had trouble hiring some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then pushing them all to his background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when shown, the screen lights up. The story revolves around Falk and Dukakis really, but we were subjected to a senseless and ridiculous road trip and leads to Reiser getting over a very gentle and precious paper with deep psychological insight (wrong!). For example, in a restaurant scene I imagine that Reiser was hoping to be "like Casavit" there is a laughably laughable confrontation between Reiser and Falk. This is very ridiculous, I was embarrassed by Volk.
