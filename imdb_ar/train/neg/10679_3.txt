I did not expect a good movie like "In The Line of Fire" or episode "24", but it seems that this film was produced for television and did a modest job at best. The (good) actor could not hide the fact that the plot was very predictable and the actors had to fight (they really tried to do their best), through their bad text lines, giving their characters fairly flat additions. When I saw the movie, I felt that I saw most of it in other films (better). In it you have car chases, great shoots, romance, plot twists etc .; this movie contains nothing. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** Once you see another woman talking on the phone to the Cuban character, you know who stands behind all this and all the hints you get ("You stand close to the president, I see her from my point of view .. ") looks silly. <br /> <br /> If it is up to me (and perhaps it is good not to be so) I would rewrite this plot: <br /> <br /> The First Lady orders her husband to be killed because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba All the time.
