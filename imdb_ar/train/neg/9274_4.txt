This sequel is a total rework of the first film. The film is completely useless. It took basically every single scenario of the first film and they returned it in Omen IV only with the Antichrist this time. So ends up the same way first! The music is very busy and overlapping, and because it is a copy of Omen I, it is very predictable. It is not a terrible film, it is not terribly made, there are films much worse, and there was nothing at all. The Omen reissue of 2006 is much worse, and even more useless, so I think it has this. If someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this series or series 2006, I think I would choose that.
