This is just plain Indian waste being screened as a movie, where we can proudly boast that we have the biggest film industry, yet it is the worst. <br /> <br /> How can other poor countries have real films that challenge the views of their communities and continue to pump garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, and see our wonderful movies and our crap like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> Get real people, and no wonder the international community generally laughs at Indian Cinema.
