Uma Thurman plays Sisi, a young gypsy woman (and a horribly big thumb) that runs across the country and eventually finds her real place among a group of house-dwelling cowboys on a farm dedicated to the maintenance of a cockroach; Rain (bow) Phoenix is Their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy or Thumb or not. Gus Van Sant directed and edited Tom Robbins' book, but his spelling is not a primary goal and only skips around the map, like Sissy (perhaps that was his goal, but not the audience). The famous box office window has not been so much overlooked, and one can see why: it's a series of graphics looking for a piece of land, and presentations, guidances and cinematography are all changing. The Thurman is a stitch on the side of the highway trying to ride, but this is putting the kibush in Phoenix. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but probably had to submit) offers the best performing content like a doctor who works on one of these thumbs. <br /> <br /> Thumb is down.
