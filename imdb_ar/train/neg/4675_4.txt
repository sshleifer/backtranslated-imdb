"Washington Square" is a flat, flat adaptation of Henry James's short novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from the masterpieces of James. Moreover, her simple story, which does not fit the events, seems inappropriate to turn it into a film (although William Wheeler, with The Heiress, gave a beautiful copy of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> In any case, the film completely betrayes the spirit of this work by the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but she is nevertheless a smart young intelligent, she is not as naive as she may seem. Her adherence to her father is respected and respectable, with no obsession. Over three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Lee) seems to be just mentally retarded, a bad thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly became (and incredibly) smart, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that. <br /> <br /> Director Agneska Holland has added two storytelling stories to the story. The first is when the child Catherine suffers from the problems of Veseca. Scene II, when we see in the background a kind of outdoor brothels, with prostitutes taking their customers behind the tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit of Henry James as artistic. It is known that the writer was very decent and even sober for the standards of the Victorian era. I challenge anyone to find any roughness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James' huge literary production. I was particularly disturbed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the director needs a reasonable freedom to adapt the screen to the novel. But if the director completely ignores or misinterprets the art of the author (here Henry James), I do not see the benefit of using his work to produce a bad film. <br /> <br /> Acting is appropriate for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a movie not recommended.
