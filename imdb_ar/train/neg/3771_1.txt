This must be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When I and my friends watched this movie (as we were the target audience that was targeting it), we sat and watched the first half of an hour with my jaw touching the floor in how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, leaving or screaming in public that they had already paid money they had earned from working to watch this film's weak excuse. It should be a great idea on paper, but no one in the film seems to have an idea of ​​what's going on. Representation crap, crap costumes. I can not understand how this embarrassing thing can be seen. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
