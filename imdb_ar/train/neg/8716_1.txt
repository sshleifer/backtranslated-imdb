I do not know where to start; acting, special effects and writing are all very bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff reached a point where they said: "Our mission has been accomplished, it is time to launch it." I am happy that the first two in the series have never reached the UK. I really recommend watching this movie only so you can estimate how much quality most movies are. <br /> <br /> I do not know how any other IMDb user can find it scary when "dreadful" dinosaurs migrate down the aisles with rubber arms flowing around them.
