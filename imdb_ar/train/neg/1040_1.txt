I can not believe that this film managed to get a relatively high rating of 6! It is hardly an incredibly boring sight and it is certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In a non-budgetary way, I was reminded of the first and second Star Wars episodes for the absolute impression that you are seeing the wreckage of a total creative train. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It is one of the "festival films" that satisfy pseudo-intellectuals just because they are made very poorly of these people think they make them "different" and therefore good. <br /> <br /> Making bad films is not "different", it's just a bad film industry.
