I hired End Game, after I had never heard of it, but I was fascinated by political excitement so I thought I would. After doing some research on the film, I found that it was initially dedicated to the theatrical release, but instead, it became compressed on the DVD. After seeing him, I think, "No wonder". The film is shocked in its obscurity. Plot and characters are routine. I discovered whodunnit by the middle of the road but the end was a curve ball. I must say, I did not expect it to end just as I did, but this is not in its favor. The most predictable end was a favorite on a very bad one. The filmmakers may have seen the film's predictability, so they decided to take a quick look at the film - even the film that made the film worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and returned 107 minutes.
