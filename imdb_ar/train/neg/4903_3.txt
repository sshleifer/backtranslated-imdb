I am never very impressed with the production of Taiwan films instead of Korea, Hong Kong or even China. There is hardly a strong representative quality as is clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself a picky audience because I am actually an independent film enthusiast. But this film shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle where the plot went. Acting definitely does not make it better. The Reynesian actor acts disproportionately because she "behaves excessively", trying to be fun and gentle. Although I have to admit it is a pleasure to see it. On the other hand, Isabella Leung plays a more appropriate role as a very confused, sad and regrettable character. Overall I find this movie a disappointment.
