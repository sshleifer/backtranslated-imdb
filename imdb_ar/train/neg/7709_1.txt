You never see this movie. <br /> <br /> He's trying to be a parody of science fiction and thriller movies in the 1950s and 1960s, but all he gives up is to make you wish you could see one of them, not that. . <br /> <br /> It's very lame. Parody must have some aspects that have some higher quality than par for it. This film has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save for yourself. It's too late for me but ... you do not see it.
