This movie deserves to be seen if you enjoy admiring special effects. There are some interesting pictures. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's the 1990s / eternal Hollywood fare dazzle without content. According to the title, <br /> <br /> It is not worth telling the story. This is like conducting brain surgery on dinosaurs. There is not much to start with. Nothing original and not very special. So do not get into the story at all. See only the effects. <br /> <br /> As mentioned previously, it is a bit flashy at the end, reducing the purity of FX's wonderful treatment of an invisible man (and sometimes half invisible). However, if you ignore the "standard" fireworks, it is the viewer to look at them (or do not look at them). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a decent FX movie worth watching for this purpose and this alone.
