It is clear that the writer / director of this film knows nothing about the film. I think DP has been linked to this project and replaced by a monkey, because all the scenes were very dark or had hot spots more than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrifying, and the characters were very one dimension. For someone to say that this film was designed for poker lovers and not film lovers, someone would joke to themselves (perhaps the writer / director). There are no fans of poker in this world like this movie. So your money hates this project. Going to the casino and playing some hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your daily job. If he plays poker, he must be hurt.
