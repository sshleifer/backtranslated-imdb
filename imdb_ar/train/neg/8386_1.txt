Tear this film apart from launching a fish in a barrel. its very easy. So I will challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of the young man. First, I admire the special effects. It really looked like the head of Marlon Wynes was tied to the body of a small person. I did not doubt it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Second, I liked some of the unexpected riddles. David Alain Greer played a troubling singer for the restaurant, and the renditions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who happened to play the role of Greer's father in Bumirang in 1992 (if you remember, the "mushroom belt" format with the mushroom jacket) now plays with Vanessa's father in Little Man. It was fun. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, this movie is just as believable as white chicks. How stupid is it when a doctor can not even tell that he is a 40-year-old and not an infant? I've got a whole set of teeth! How can no one seem to notice that he is not a child? The little guy is so bad that Rob Schneider has a veil. Please, if you are stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, I should at least not bring your children. This film is very sexy for young children (lots of jokes and hints about sex, getting off, eating out, etc.) and I was embarrassed by the parents who brought their children to the show that they were forced to endure. If you insist on seeing a stupid movie, be sure to avoid your children from pain and suffering.
