This was the first feature film starring Stooges, which is very bad. It makes the three STOOGES around the world in a daze (since 1963) as a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are giants in a rocket-propelled grenade. They climb up to a rocket and go to Venus. They meet some things there, including one of the conversations they call "Uni" and bring back to earth with them. "Yoni," he says, as if he is a nice, average person, "Oh, hello, how are you, a beautiful planet here, I hope you like it." Very few gags and lots of scenes only go on and on. <br /> <br /> Strikers return from space and the film ends as far as the story goes, but no one told the filmmakers that the picture Continue for another 10 minutes or so at a party where there is not much going on. Stooges leaves the concert and the film ends almost. <br /> <br /> The point of the film is the end of Stooges singing a small docking song about their trip. Larry and Carlie Joe Moe hit him in the face with two pancakes. <br /> <br /> Another writer reported the wonderful musical result .Hah? The only music I noticed was a melody N Classic - I'll get romantic and go there again, where both are running in concert. * This * is really the point of the picture - the music from the old Colombian movies. <br /> <br /> The sexy blonde was tall and nice . <br /> <br /> Awesome - a new VHS video of just 99 cents stored.
