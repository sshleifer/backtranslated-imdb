why?!! This was a bleak, uninspiring and embarrassing film. The embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they allow these people to make a BAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more than a romantic comedy ... and there was nothing ROBO. It all changed with the attraction of Disney. why???? They have a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Matthew Broderick's vision of making fun of his own films was not too enjoyable. Shish !!
