This is the first time for me, the first time I'm disappointed in Tim Burton's film. POTA is not a bad film (fantastic collections, fashion and fantastic performance weird) but it could have been produced by any Hollywood director who is abandoned. The rhythm was very strange, with only the last third waiting for the film to finish, myself and the film. Tim Roth was excellent, and perhaps the only fun in the film. Come back Tim.
