I have two home entertainment stores and I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this store was so bad that I was asked to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sophia Coppola deserves an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III when compared to the performance of Giada Collegrand in this film. Her boyfriend died one month before arriving at his "rubber house". Once she arrives, she discovers that she has been deceived throughout her relationship but none of them appear to have registered with her. Within a day, she began a relationship with Leslie, (DAVO) acting housekeeper. Although she married Dafoe off the screen, she was seen with him cool and unemotional. <br /> <br /> If there is a plot, I miss it. Willem Dafoe can not save this movie from the wreck of an amateur, movie-oriented train.
