I have a generally awesome video and scan for "Boom!" , And I want to see it with all its great glory. So I voted "1" and I hope you will. Together, we can pull this movie into the filth of filth and hope someone sees a chance for BIG MONEY to launch "Boom!" In the Director Cut the extended version. The movie is one of my favorite favorites, where you only look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the photographer, and you say to yourself, "Yes, I think you can fool some people for a long time." Producers who are considering a DVD version of "Boom!" It should be noted that everywhere it was shown, there were crowds selling in the theaters. But it has not reached Frostbite Falls yet.
