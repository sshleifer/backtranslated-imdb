This film is only Bill Maher's interpretation of religion. There are several funny moments, some points of interest, but do not go to this and expect a fair discussion of religion. This is what I consider the worst kind of documentaries - everything is arranged in advance and edited to provide you with the director's opinion, rather than allowing you to make your own decision. <br /> <br /> Editing - It's very fragmented, overlapping with clips from pop culture and the media to promote this point. The person being interviewed barely has a chance to end the sentence before the amendment is interrupted. The only people who have been given a good chance to express their views are those who say what Bill Maher wants to say. Once a person deviates from the Gospel, Maher says, he is freed. <br /> <br /> Interviews - supposed to represent most of the absolute extreme religions. From the evangelical television to the final Jewish stereotype, to the church the truck stopped (seriously. We have chosen the worst abducted money, extreme extremists, and those who do not have the budget to say "no". When a good person meets him, he releases the hell from them. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. A particularly hard blow is Muslims. During the Islamic period, hardly anyone has the opportunity to speak before boycotting it either by himself or through liberation with some suicide bombers. All Muslims are portrayed as armed radicals through liberation, and none of the people interviewed have been freed fairly. <br /> <br /> The end - the message in the end is too heavy, and although interesting the idea, is not fairly presented to countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while playing the parts of destruction in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. It is also mentioned that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> Because of the disadvantages of the film, it contains some good points, and humor, though unfair, is already funny. But be aware, it's a one-sided view, Bill Maher's view of religion. He does not discover anything. It tells you what to think. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments, but with a very irresponsible documentary style.
