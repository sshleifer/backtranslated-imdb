This movie attempts to follow this type of low-budget mobile camera that has proven effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This movie, fails, and how. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many of these awards, which have been named "Awards", have been tapped on the cover ..... It makes you wonder what those critics were when they already did this .... < > <br /> Words fail to describe how horrible this film really is. Seriously, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I saw him in 20 minutes flat, almost continuously ahead. <br /> <br /> From the garbage lighting to the awesome output, the grainy videos to the muffled voice, and of course do not forget the ABYSMAL representation, this was a pathetic piece of pathetic filmmaking. <br /> <br /> It is dangerous, and has no appreciable characteristics - at all. Save your money and watch the flick on a low budget, and there are a lot there - dead end, witch Blair, REC, to name a few. <br /> <br /> Avoid this trash at all costs. Do not waste your money or time on this garbage that pretends to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to all the other comments! You have been warned!
