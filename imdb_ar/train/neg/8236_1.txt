I can not believe that this exists on DVD. It was even available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good film considering that it only had $ 4,000. I find this funny. I found it very bad whatever the budget. <br /> <br /> Still more funny, I read the following in another article: "The play aside, if you like horror and you like something like Duel (1971) has been updated with more story and some beautiful girls who have been dumped, You'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What? This is a shame compared to these two films. <br /> <br /> I give "1", where I can not give "0". I do not see any way this movie can be amusing.
