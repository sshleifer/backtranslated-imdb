This movie was terrible. Well, my favorite film is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I've always been a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The plot collapses, and expels enough of the main elements originally to make the term "reshaping" highly questionable. (He's not a virgin, but he's sensitive to the bees. Wow!) Many things are meaningless and incomprehensible, which I'm afraid LaBute does not make a horror film. (How can two people we saw in a car bomb clearly start at the beginning and end of the film?) Cage looks arrogant and astonished all the time, and his character is prone to calling for "Rowan!" At the slightest noise. The gestures to the original are disturbing because they bear fruit rather than smart greetings. For example, there are certain incidents that reflect the original (the girl who falls from the closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage searches for the island) and many lines of dialogue are picked directly from Anthony Shaffers' original screenplay and logged into the shoe. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis of this, I can not really bother you with writing about this movie. He lacks any kind of material. Throw it on the scrap pile with all the other versions that have been tarnished with the good names of the films that "relied on" (in this case too loosely).
