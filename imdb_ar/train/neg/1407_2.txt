After a miracle life, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do Do Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of silly alien without a story. It seems that wild wild humor of "Under Ground" has turned into a pathetic rampage here. It seems that Kosturica has been steadily declining since he started producing life-threatening comedy movies, from the black cat, the white cat, whom I thought was wonderful, but he already had some annoying dementia marks. I liked his early movies very much, and for that reason, it is disappointing to see such a thing. Let's hope that his next one will be great.
