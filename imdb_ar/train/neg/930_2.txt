Some children walk in the mountains, one of them goes to a big tunnel and discovers some old embalmed wrestler. He wears the helmet of the wrestler and spends the rest of the film killing all other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is completely meaningless, it's crazy. The following is a short list of meaningless things: <br /> <br /> 1) There is a young man and a girl in their tent who believe they hear something outside. The man goes out to investigate and finds another rookie outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream until she returns to the tent - coming the next morning?!? It was only 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) Then these two screams are heard screaming (what, 100 feet?), but do not check because they are afraid to be lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another young man and girl walk around, and in Scene 10 together, the girl learns that because of the circumstances, the protocol no longer asks him to address her as a professor. I mean, what ...? First, it's just a really stupid thing to say, and secondly he never contacted her professor in the first nine scenes they were in. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and stops her, telling her that part of his wrestling training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yes, we noticed that she was hit and did not die because she was raised and walked around. But, thanks to this information. <br /> <br /> 5) The girl is tied in the Demonicus cache, and when someone tries to release her, they instead ask that person to go and get help. Um, look, stupid, if you let go, which will take about 5 seconds, there will be no need for help. <br /> <br /> It will continue. The entire middle part of the film is spent with the loss of the idiot in the forest, then fighting, then painting a tent, ignoring the screams of their friends, and then wandering about each other. It's just boring and damn useless that the DVD turned off halfway. <br /> <br /> Do not sympathize with any of these characters, especially those that get most of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I see him - he looks like a kid wearing a costume on Halloween, and his face gets angry to look evil. Run around, or I must say that cheaters around him like me. Special comic effects, acting is mostly awful, and nothing has any meaning. <br /> <br /> In general, this concept may have produced an interesting film if they put more time and effort into it, get rid of the funny dialogue, create characters with actual loved characters, have a kind of logical flow of work, and perhaps Demonicus even made a female figure in the sexy wrestler outfit. But no, instead, we get a meaningless pile of nonsense that will save you to death.
