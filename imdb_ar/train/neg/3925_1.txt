I saw this movie "Hot" when it was introduced in 1986. He got a X rating for a short oral sex scene but he played in the main theaters (he was a "technical" film). It is supposed to be the first film ever presented by a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a boy in high school (Federico Petistales) in love (conceptually) with an elderly woman (Marushka Demers). As we mentioned before, the Detmers are very beautiful and have a good body, but they also made a very good performance. The Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) very bad. No wonder he did not make another film. However, despite the gruesome sex scene (which is frank but very brief), this is a boring slow-moving story I felt bored of silly. Good disposition by Detmers only helped to a certain extent. Mostly I look at my watch patiently waiting until it ends. If he does not have this sequence, he will forget this film for a long time. Dull and slow. You can skip this one.
