One might think that the film about a young man dealing with booming homosexuality would be boring. Think again. This production must be packaged and sold as a remedy for insomnia because its strength is up to ten times any sleep aid in the market. It seems as if the filmmaker is a movie maker, but he's getting lazy and decided instead to run a series of random images (and random borings), scenes that do not go anywhere, throwing a few real scenes of actual acting and pretending that good lighting is not important In the process of making films, and conclude it under the auspices of the film "arthouse". This is exactly the kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional filmmakers to promote the motion of independent films, which prevents the general public from adopting independent films more easily. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in movies that cover this subject, it would be better for you to watch some of the great short films available on the Logo website or Rent Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip the long dredging piece.
