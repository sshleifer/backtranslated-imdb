I was very excited when this series was first introduced in 2005. The idea was very simple and attractive: each episode will be a one-hour mini-film directed by a famous horror director. Then, when I finally saw them, it was a disappointment. Some good episodes of this season appeared, but overall they were a mixed bag. I brought it back to the learning curve, and I saw that the second season would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, you're in shock. At least in one season he had some good stories here and there. The second season (with the exception of the movie "Black Cat" starring Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and complete loss to me. The "Sounds Like" episode may be the worst thing I've seen on television in the past ten years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that this season will turn third next year, but I do not hold back my breath.
