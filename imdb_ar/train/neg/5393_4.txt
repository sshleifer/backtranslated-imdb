I am a Shakespearean fan, and I can appreciate what Ken has done to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of viewers. However, this film does not link the general intentions of the play with the funny musical sequences. In addition, with Alicia Silverstone stumbling around the dialogue (Keanu Reeves reminds us of a lot of literature about nothing) and other bad roles, all of this equates to stunning tolerance for presentation.
