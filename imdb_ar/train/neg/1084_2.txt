I rented this DVD for two reasons. A group of adult actors, director, although Robert Altman can hit or miss. In this case, Miss was great. Attempted Altman's attempt to create suspense on the keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like "Dead Again", I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope he does not spoil his reputation. It seems that Robert Duvall has fallen in the way of most of the Oscars once. On a downward spiral that includes acting in films like this one. Duval was once a great actor in excellent films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". It was a big waste of time. I give it 2 out of 10.
