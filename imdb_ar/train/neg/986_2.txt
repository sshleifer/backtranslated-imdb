This movie got an IMDB 8.1 rating, so I was expecting a lot from it. Start funny and granular with energy you feel automatically. But before the movie ends, the clouds begin and everything becomes predictable. The characters in the office were exhilarating in the first third of the film, but we get to know them well; they become cartoons, not real people at all. This is the same story I have seen hundreds of times, and I have only told her in slightly different circumstances. The thing, is that I can deal with another predictable love story if the dialog box is not just out of date! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is that the characters were incoherent and unbelievable motives, and unfortunately was as with a dead letter office. Hopefully this movie will end in Dead Dead Office soon.
