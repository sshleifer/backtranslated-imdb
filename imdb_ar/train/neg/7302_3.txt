The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After that, go straight from a decent thing to a kind of illegal comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about the Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I recommend watching this film for the absolute truth of learning how not to make a movie. There are many scenes in this film that make one stop and wonder if the crew and the entire crew have stopped paying attention at some point. The thing that amazes me more about this film is that it made $ 22 million at the box office and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to the Lion Gate for his ability to pull it.
