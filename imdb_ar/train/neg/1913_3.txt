"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Given the people involved, it should be better several times. <br /> <br /> Watching it, if you are at least somewhat connected to believing it will improve, is likely to make you cry. It was one of those films that had potential, but was stolen from this possibility by a terrible scenario and some bad deeds, not to mention the annoying and unnecessary George Clooney and the man who reminds me of Pritchard Dreyfus, but who cares so little that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only saved movie grace is its exotic vocabulary. I found myself thinking about it over and over as I watched more offenders. That is the only reason I gave the film 3. The plot is boring, the characters are nervous, unnecessarily degrading, and very undesirable. They are in a constant state of painful tension and they are all so annoying that I have observed the obstacles they face. Screaming at each other and splitting with enthusiasm. Dialogue is at best obscure and humiliated in its low points. <br /> <br /> I find that Steven's "passage" Soderbergrabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are responsible for this. They must be tried for war crimes, if anyone remembers these nonsense actually enough to take care of.
