This plot does not offer any new excitement; it starts with the same first cube. This time there are no other improvements to the cube mechanism, except for an extra output, unprotected, and highly innovative. As the characters are not as good as the first episode, they have become "flat" as in the soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone succeeds in getting out naturally, he will ask you some questions, such as "Do you believe in God?" , It is not really creative or original, especially in my opinion, consistent with the secret of the cube with traps. There really is nothing else I can say about it.
