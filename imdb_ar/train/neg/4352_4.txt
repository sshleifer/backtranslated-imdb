If you have seen friends, you will feel very familiar writing. The last three or four seasons are often shared in the same comedies. <br /> <br /> The presentation revolves around a group of people who are connected by the same chapter when they were still young (about 10 years of age I think). Now, they are in their mid-twenties, and are reuniting again on class reunion. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> The typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is divided into multiple sections, which are then displayed in mixed order. <br /> <br /> Graphics are where my problems lie in this series. As in subsequent friends' seasons, is often a ridiculous situation with unbelievable positions. One of the main characters doing something stupid is hard to believe. The position is then amplified severely, as if it was not silly enough. If you're a fan of this kind of humor, you might like this series. To me, it's a great start. <br /> <br /> The reason I started watching friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and particularly credible story lines, with some romance that make you the root of the characters. The class has no this. Characters are simply too imposed and stereotypes are pushed away. Therefore, can not link them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before his power ran out, and personality traits were eliminated. But in the classroom, his strength seems to be running out before he starts.
