I do not like this movie very much. If you have read Puzo Books, or at least closely watched the first two films (especially I), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the epic of Corleone provided by Pozo's novel, the screenplay of this film is, at times, silly. The characters and their relations are distorted. The story ends up reaching anywhere, although it seems to be heading towards some direction during the film. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone epic in the 1990s, and we will not use to find things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films, in contexts when they did not fit. why is that? It looks like a bad-done supplement trying to copy the original movie. <br /> <br /> What will never be understood is the fact that Mario Bozo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined in. A man who directed pieces such as Apocalypse Now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the cinema until his death. So did the Pacino, because he is the actor. But Mario Bozo did not have to write this. How so? He damaged all his previous works. What a shame, my friend. Puzo's "The Last Don" is the story of the nineties about mobs, which is fantastic. We can never say the same thing about the Third Godfather's plot.
