Erwin Allen was fantastic. Every television program had a big pilot, or the first episode. The rest basically rip off his other shows. There were a few episodes of the "Swiss family Robinson" that was launched from his older television programs. One of the episodes of "The Swiss Family" coincides with one of the episodes of "The Land of the Giants" when a party member needs to carry out the appendix process. The show was a high budget and very expensive to continue. Irwin lost touch with television programs after the 1960s. Strong representation with Martin Milner. The baby stars started there with such a show as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Erwin Allen combines the scenes of his disaster like a hurricane and a volcanic eruption called "Disaster Master"
