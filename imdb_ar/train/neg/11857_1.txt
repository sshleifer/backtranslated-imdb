Worst film ever! Please see the real movie reviews of the pros in this movie. The comments on this site are apparently from people with some financial interest in this film. I find positive comments very misleading. I find it surprising that the negative comments are very bad against this film and that the positive comments look like the Oscars speech. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is retarded! I can not believe that such a film will ever be made. Why is Hollywood wasting their time in this garbage? This movie is trying nothing. Ask myself what will actually engulf their money that produces such garbage. I went to the blockbuster and told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I wasted my time and criticism. Please do not commit the same mistake! It's really "the worst movie ever made!"
