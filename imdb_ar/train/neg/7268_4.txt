Boring, long, toned, repetitive, self-involved? It felt like a bad date. Worse still, the boring school art trend - with the heavy use of the rotary shot that has become so exaggerated that I have risen from it - - is constantly screaming to be observed. Add the thinnest plots and almost no dialogue, and the film begins to appear like a four-hour epic about 30 minutes. It gets worse: instead of dialogue, there are bad written audio and quotations and songs that are clearly attached to the characters. Opera music is really very loud. I blame everything on the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for film stars. He and other actors have some exciting moments giving. So these begin to get bored after 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director performs the post of Bel Ami pornographic. The architecture of the stunning campus as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How do universities in the United States come nicely (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this movie. Want to use the Quick Scan button? a lot.
