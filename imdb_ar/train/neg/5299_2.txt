I really liked the vulgar movies, but this film is really awesome. The representation is lame, the script is bad, and the atmosphere does not exist. The plot is as follows: Distorted gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town. That's right - this is the plot. Very original, ah! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not even glorious enough - if the film is not scary, it should at least make it bloody. Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs. If you want to see some good vulgar clicks, see "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Before Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just do not waste your precious time with this useless piece of trash.
