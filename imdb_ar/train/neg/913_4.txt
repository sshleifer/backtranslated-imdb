Well now, let's see. What was funny in the first film? I know, the people with the ridiculous dialects, the people who fall into the water, the ridiculous boats and funny comments between the two teams. In this film, they distorted the tone part to the maximum, not good. As a whole lot of people fall into the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, tried but failed. Also, there are also characters to follow in this film. This film must be about what happens on the water, not on the ground. I am sorry to say that there is a lot between the funny parts and that the sponsors of the film are being exploited to the fullest extent. Not good. All in all, I give it four out of ten because it contains funny parts.
