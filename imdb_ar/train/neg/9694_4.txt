Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seiberg and her father, Bohemian widow David Neven, spend a holiday in southern France with Josie Melin Demongo. Things are fine until you show family friend Deborah Kerr. Nivens, a Deer of Degradation, finds that the invasion of Kiir is difficult to resist. This is good with Seberg, as long as Nevin loves her and leaves her (as he did with all the women in his past ... including Demongeot). When it seems like a banana again in Niven's life, Therg avenged Kerr. Preminger tells the story in the memories of the past from the perspective of Seberg and intelligently combines black-and-white and sunny color scenes. George Perrinal's cinematic photography is stunning. The film shows some of the less harsh Breminger's direction, although close-ups are rarely allowed, making it difficult to determine what actors feel. Arthur Laurent wrote the script, which is full of acidic dialogue and funny scenes (mostly involving demonogot that affects birds). Seberg is gaining herself fairly well, but Niven is at least attractive to him ... and shows no chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really steps wrong with this casting. It is a role that seems to be specifically designed for someone closer to Charles Bauer. With Jeffrey Horne as a potential Seberg expert and Martetta Hunt as his mother Duffy. Juliet Greco, playing herself, sings the title song at a nightclub in Paris. The great titles are by the regular Bremerger Saul Bass.
