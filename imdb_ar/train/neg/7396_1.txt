Unfortunately, I must agree with the critic who wrote Halops. <br /> <br /> For a short film, cinematography, costumes, crews, sounds, editing and everything else is very good. This might seem surprising at first but I was told that the technical staff working on it was made up of professionals, so the quality would be expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The thing, it's not a real story. To tell a story (or in case of cinema, show a story), you need a plot and a struggle. You need things that happen to the hero: events. These events occur because the protagonist wants something and for some reason can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that observes humanity. This is. So what we have here is the pure exhibition. Instead of presenting a story, we simply learn things about individual Tim Watcher. Of course, given Tim Watcher's strange nature and the short duration of the film, it's hard to give enough background to him until the film turns to Voice-Over Narration. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, providing information we have never collected. In fact, if this is not the case for VO, we would think that the character was just a strange old man around things. To make matters worse, VO also explains what happens on the screen! The pictures displayed are just the textures that we listen to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short film will make a good video for a band or something, but because the pictures do not do that. "It is impossible to say that, obviously what remains is a value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew Reasonable, but good) but fails to entertain, entertain, thrill or at least show a story.
