C'mon players some of the former reviewers almost wrote a novel commenting on this episode. It's just a 60-year-old TV show! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow) ever used in Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real external location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were completely confined to the acoustic stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an external site (and babe) gives an appropriate depth and quality-like film in a very ordinary episode of that date now and a very familiar presentation. <br /> <br /> With the exception of some notable exceptions, such as "The City on the Edge of Eternity", "The Mission of the Earth" and "Tomorrow Yesterday", the old series of Star Trek must be a serious moth - a ball and a ball of misery. Half a dozen of the good episodes of 79 is a mediocre fight. <br /> <br /> This is a model of the boring things produced by Jane Roddenberry at the time, in fact, contrary to the popular belief that some people worship the land on which he was walking, he has already made a lot of garbage! It does not deserve to be talked about at the same time as Irwin Allen for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at Enterprise Bridge Group from a modern perspective. They used pavering floor plywood, plastic sheeting chairs and cheap cardboard over the dashboards. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Every account saved or what!
