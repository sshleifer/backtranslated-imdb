Have you heard of a Taiwan horror film? Or any Taiwanese film? Maybe for some reason. This was really boring, though he had black magic, including the bodies of withered children and people bursting in with thousands of snakes. <br /> <br /> After reading the ideas of other peoples, I was looking forward to some violence and gore, but not much at all. Some blood and other lame things, if you wait for graphic gore or any heinous effects you will be disappointed. Obviously they did not use the eel and other things as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Nothing good in this movie. One character was not quite pleasant and some black magic mascots agree, like the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror side did not work at all, and the most terrifying thing was the Albino girl (and this is not really scary). This is the worst Asian horror film I have ever seen.
