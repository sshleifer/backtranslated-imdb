A really terrible film left me bored by watching for 40 minutes or until I could stand up. Not wrong actors, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc., need a very strict talk. You may think it is deep. not like that. This rape and extreme violence, unlike what is essential in Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the totality of human understanding. It's not Straw Dogs, which I saw in it too. Instead, it seems that Pete Walker has something around him, but even in saying that I may be somewhat unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a strong human desire, but the bedroom window has a lot to say about it and about putting the male down more than this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think it is very offensive, but just very delightful in his portrayal of some details - the blood that leaks to his leg in rape, par example. This is not a challenge or a collision, although I'm sure filmmakers consider themselves "very bold", but not very happy. Is this why those involved in filmmaking want to? (I wrote here the Latin phrase that was translated as Oh Times, oh habits!) But the new spell checking on IMDb will not allow me to publish until I remove it. > Where is noble ambition? Noble motivation? When you look at the British film - a joyful comedy of Eiling or the explosive brothers; Carroll Reid worked with Graham Greene on Fulin Idol, our man in Havana or High III man (a film he has a lot to say about evil over a thousand straightheads); Powell's work and Pressburger . Or if you want to talk about sex, violence and emulating men, see "The Offence 'Dir." Sidney Lumet, from John Hopkins' original play; check out "Tunes of Glory" to see something worth doing, and that's what he says. > <br /> Contrary to the above, Straightheads is, unfortunately, a completely unpleasant waste of celluloid.
