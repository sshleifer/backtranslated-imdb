I have not seen the first film, and if such a thing has no great desire in it. <br /> <br /> After I just saw him a few hours ago, I find it hard to remember anything about it. <br /> <br /> It seems that the main plot is a group of very annoying people who are staying in a house with that old woman evasive from the thirteenth Friday and chased by a panel of wood. <br /> <br /> Some people die, and the film ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold me this film because I want compensation for the lost time of my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this movie out of my hands ...... Oh wait for me already I gave it away for a "friend".
