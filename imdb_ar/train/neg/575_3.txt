This film is not very good it is boring, not too much blood to horror film. The plot is just bang along with not much happening. I think the female vampire was too stupid. She had many opportunities to kill vampire hunters because she shows her having a lighting like feedback. But when one hangs up, it only takes its time and something always happens when it does not bite. No wonder that this went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> The end result: nowhere near as good as the first vampire movie. You are a sucker if you waste your time in this.
