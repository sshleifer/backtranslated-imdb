... but I'm not one of them. At least Caro Diario was famous for two-thirds of the time, but the third, boring, self-centered section of the film gave us a taste of what would have come in this self-stunning chaos. Murray says he feels the need to produce this film, but he does not want it, while the viewer feels he should stick to it, but he really does not want to. A film about Italian politics and elections may be great, but that's not the film. At some point, Murray and his friends stand outside the Communist Party headquarters and discuss the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders at home, but it is characteristic of this film that we have never seen anything from them. The events of Moretti are intertwined with the political events leading to the birth of his son, the subsequent footage of the home movie with him and the child Pietro (the film attracts us over several years and more than one election period). We still expect to see a final sequence or a convincing argument, but it never comes. I doubt he could have the patience to sit back in Nani Moretti again. He managed to make an hour and twenty minutes look like eternal.
