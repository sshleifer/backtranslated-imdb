I can not say much about this film. I think he is talking about himself (as do the current assessments here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even / tried / liked watching it twice, but I could not. I can safely say that I never want to see this waste of time ever again. I'm not someone who dismantles a movie, but I really think that was terrible. It was not so funny at the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walkin in them. I think this movie destroyed both Jack Black and Ben Stiller. All I can think of when I see one of their films now days later is this terrible movie, and that reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Boehler is also very troublesome. <br /> <br /> In general, well, I think you got my point. The stars for Walken, by the way.
