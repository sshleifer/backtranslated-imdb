Most of Stephen King's short stories are small jewels, original ideas that do not take long to evolve; depend primarily on the medium - quickly set them up in a rare number of pages, read, and end before you know you've started. They look like a carton of McDonald's potatoes - they taste really good and you know that there is no great nutritional value in them (from a literary point of view, they do not talk much about the global humanitarian situation), but you still carry a scarf, do not be a pig and go to the large part ("Lots of grease" is a metaphor for prose in King novels when you find yourself reading one of them and saying: Come on - with cultural pop reviews or a clever Yankee side - follow the story already!) He compiled four short story collections . I've read them all - from NightShift to the latest, everything in the end, and they all show an efficient access to the point that is sometimes lacking in large-scale novels. <br /> <br /> But his short stories did not exceed their reception ... which led us to the TV adaptation of Nightmares and Dreamscapes ... <br /> <br /> How in Hell did they get (green serial producers) light to turn stories Which usually averaged 15 pages per 50 minute loop? I'll tell you how - two words - "Stephen King". It is possible that the stories bearing his name are not cheap, and offers that take one hour to advertise more than half an hour, so ... what should have been chosen mostly from 23 or 24 minutes is converted to twice that length, and doubled Trading time ... Ka-Ching! <br /> <br /> I will not waste time collecting these story charts - this review assumes that you've already read the stories and / or watched the show. The following is just a response to what TNT has done ... Of the four premiums so far, here is a 10 cent rating (from first to worst): <br /> <br /> Battleground - is not classic in any way, but hey, How can anyone argue with preventing William Hurt from opening his company by filming this episode without a single line of dialogue? The Tale of the Tongue in the Cheetah and the Destruction of Zuni's Killer Doll by Trilogy Of Terror Produced me by the producers (and the writer of the Tribal, the son of Richard Matheson - writer TOT) knew his mission with this was to make the action deadly, but at the same time, fun. It took longer to get to Hert's apartment than it should have been, but I think it has achieved the goal. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Omney's Last Case - I liked this situation primarily because of the performance of William H. Macy. I think the writer / Omni should have appeared in the story early in the beginning of the eye / Omni's own because it was the actual reality of the story, and anyone who was familiar with the story of the short king (perhaps half of them, if not more than the audience) knew it was due to The Chandleresque group stops the writer's reality, so let's keep going, and cut off your really cute and boisterous partner's banter. As soon as the tragedy of the writer / Omni began to unfold, I thought that the exhibition had developed an emotional relationship that made the viewer (at least me) sympathetic to Messi's realistic attempt to escape his sorrows by raping his imaginative imaginative creations. 6/10 <br /> <br /> End of total chaos - ah, this title is what I felt about this episode when it ended. After twenty minutes, you're ready to shout on TV - well, we've already got it, the younger brother is Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! We know from Ron Livingstone to talk to the camera ("Time is running out for me" - not fast enough, I think) that the little boy will discover something bad for humanity - we know it because he actually built an airplane but he almost died because he could not direct it out of the tree path; He detonated the chemistry lab during his own teaching of chemistry (to believe that the end of the world could have been prevented if this child alone had supervised more parental supervision). He wasted a lot of time creating the genius of Henry Thomas, when we finally came to discover his discovery - the end of the world through unintended crap - to what extent do we see the world "end?" - a cheap video shot of a reporter who began to forget what she published, Announces the Day of Judgment at hand. Oh, and the brother of the brother Yassin and sing the old songs. My point is, if your story revolves around "the end of the whole mess (the world)," I want to see "chaos" as it escalates into fires, accidents and burns. We are talking about closing with gullibility, in fact. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Crouch End - This episode took me out completely. I was able to live with a show of happy couples who arrived at their hotel forever, slapping them and laughing, and getting a taxi (half the ring there), if they finally crossed to Crouch End, the episode chilled, but it failed in unhappiness . It was not only frightening, it was laughable in practice. Oh, look - Kitty ... wait, it turns out ... oh my God! Look at it's scary eye! Hey. They could have gone a long way toward depicting the Crouch end sequence at night instead of daylight. Things that you may find unintentionally funny can become more frightening when you see them in the shadows of the night. But I think the budget was not high enough to shoot at night on the fake London groups they slapped together on this group. On this page, this is a very scary story about tourists who walk around in places they should not do and the terrible things that may lie nearby. The only horror in this adaptation was the direction and action - that was really terrifying. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Overall series average (up to date): 4/10
