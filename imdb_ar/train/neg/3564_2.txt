Pet Sematary, although a "terrifying horror" in the 80's, with a director and a beautiful atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER from Pupi Avati. Stephen King almost copied all of the director's ideas (Zeder was produced before King wrote a book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the earth, everything was copied, this is a state of happiness, but Stephen Kind is an American writer It is quite natural to be able to overcome this, obviously due to the large difference between this type of Italian films without a budget (and in part, this is nonsense ...) But the original idea, I repeat, is that Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
