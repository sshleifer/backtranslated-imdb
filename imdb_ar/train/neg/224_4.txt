The worst thing about Crush is not that he acted very badly, or that the plot is almost non-existent, not bad even if the photographer is the best. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it contains a few very wonderful moments that make you hope there will be more in the future. <br /> <br /> But in the end, time is too short and too late. If you are a violin fan and a sight of cheap tears for 40 women who cry, hug and talk about children and marriage - by all means, do not miss out. <br /> <br /> I myself am not so excited to see the above things in the film, and as a result I had a very terrible time. Some very wonderful jokes can not compensate for the rest of them. <br /> <br /> Judgment: 4/10. Guilty in wasting my time. <br /> <br />
