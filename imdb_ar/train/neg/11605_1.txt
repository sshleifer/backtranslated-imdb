At first sight of the plot slogan I thought it could have been a decent movie. Could I be more wrong than ever before? The beginning of the film makes him look like a bunch of freaks gathered and decided to make a film with a low budget. In the first ten minutes, you do not notice cowardly representation, terrible sound and terrible special effects, but it gets worse. After about 20 minutes of it, I was asking myself, "What was the plot again?" I can only ask this question when I was not upset by the sheer laugh of this film. The main actor has one place of emotions and is committed to it throughout the entire film, although he was supposed to pass through love and hate and everything in between. The scene made me almost flashback because it made me live again one minute of footage earlier. Now we have reached the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to grab Morpheus from the "matrix", although it does a terrible job. The actor who talks about "Star Wars" and the fortune cookie phrases is unbearable. Now at the end of the movie, you do not realize that at the end of the film you already believe that the plot is finally evolving. Murphy's character dies, the only good thing in the film. Say a few words and credits roll. What is that? No conspiracy, bad behavior, cheesy everything, it can not get worse. Please, if you appreciate human decency, do not watch this movie!
