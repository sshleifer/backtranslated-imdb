This "movie" is the culmination of all that is bad about the modern film. Unnecessary slow movement, flipping / jumping / indecipherable unnecessary, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue .... Essentially unnecessary. Well, I just invented it, Robot. <br /> <br /> What happened to the operation? (Ie car garage and skin spray) The only tool that shows a range of futuristic and realistic functions is to criticize the card at the cafe. <br /> <br /> What happened to show respect for women? (Smith's character does nothing but smash the doctor for the best part of the film, yet she still "wants." Where is the tension? I'll tell you where, good looks, not admiration or common ground) <br /> <br /> What happened For the detective who discovers? Smith did nothing but sit down and feel sad about himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something he thought he had left. This lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... was just fine once, but not several times in a row. (Speaking several times in a row, what was "I snore and I do not listen to you joke?" Twice in one scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of a movie that is somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to enhance rescue scenes? LaBeouf (the child) in the film for a total of two scenes, we know that A-degrades women, B knows Smith ....... of the session should care about him and whether he will come hurt or not, <br /> < Let's just forget that there are people, women and children everywhere who are attacked by robots and save selfishness only someone who has an opinion that I know about him, why he had to walk on his bike The air, transversely, while the doctor is somehow able to reach the same distance within seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me, I'm all for the scene, but also for an atmosphere of realism and meaning. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> I say that I have never really laughed hard in a movie, so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the social pendulum to swing back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and everything simpler In movies ...... but the most simple techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Movies Budget Action: "You Must Die"
