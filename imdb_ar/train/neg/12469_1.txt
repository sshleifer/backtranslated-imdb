I rarely give up a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when you rent it to a DVD. One Syriana surrendered. Halfway down, I turned him into a dull disgust. <br /> <br /> This movie is broken, boring, confusing and boring. The representation was dry and without reliable images. The plot was good, but it was so poorly developed that it failed to attract my attention. The multiple sub-plots often failed to communicate with each other and appeared to be more random stories than an actual conspiracy. Too bad such a serious subject and these great actors can create such a flop. I can not imagine this film getting any less than an award.
