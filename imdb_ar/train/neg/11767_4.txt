I had fairly high hopes for this since I loved Tim Roth. I was not happy with this film. I loved Ang Ang The The Hulk a few years ago, so I figured this would have a big impact on him. First I was very disappointed by the performance of John Hurt here. It looks as though his eyebrows have reshaped for this purpose. His performance was unconvincing. It was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is as wonderful as always here. The Gama thing did not actually stick to the original story line which I do not think. I think the best part of the film is the end. He had some cool work. The only problem with the origin was that it was very long. This is not long but a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Wal-Mart was too cheap to sell and I always wondered why? Now I know. I was hoping to explode, but I was not.
