Although I am generally a good supporter of a well-made film, I do not limit myself to films that go beyond these limits, and I often enjoy and watch films that succeed in breaking rules. It is true that director Pasolini violates the rules of cinema in force. But I also see that it does not break them successfully or to any actual point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually visible, but it is not more about what is actually on the screen than his film was actually filmed, and his short films seem less of an artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Basolini often preferred to use non-actors, and although many managers did so with remarkable results, under Basolini's guidance, non-representatives tended to remain unrepresented. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often contains images designed to shock, offend, or frustrate audiences. Such elements can often be used with amazing effect, but these elements in Pasolini's hands seem to rarely contribute anything to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who like, even admire Pasolini movies. However, I never met any of them, and I could never read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for this admiration or admiration understandable to me. Judging from his work alone, I see that he was essentially a "no-breaker" way out of the rules, much by choice as by lack of skill - initially applauded by the intellectuals of his day for "existential audacity", which is simply emphasized in bad habits as a director cinematographic. I find his works boring and unexpected and patriotic. This, too, is true for decameron. It is also, unfortunately, true in almost every Pasolini film, it has been my misfortune to bear.
