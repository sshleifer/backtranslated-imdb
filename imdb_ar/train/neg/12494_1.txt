There was nothing about this film I liked. Obviously they were low budget due to bad lighting and camera work (like the Blair Witch Project, just was not supposed to be so). There was not much plot, and the film was just a drug on and on. I've already re-routed through the last third of the movies, but that did not help much. It looked like it might be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing like this movie. There were no good actors, the special effects were faked, the camera worked terribly, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my own, I give this movie 0 of 10. Yikes!
