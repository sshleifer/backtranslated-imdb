This movie had such a promise !! What a wonderful idea, the Underdog Paintball team is struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose its speed due to bad dialogue, bad editing and a half-written story. The characters were initially interesting, only to lose their strength halfway to become one person with dimensions spawning tired lines. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spend some time in the story and the dialogue, the result would be a great movie, rather than an almost thought-out effort.
