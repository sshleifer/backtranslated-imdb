Since I felt I had picked up a new film from Jet Li to see some things but I was fighting without my mind, I got that title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more gun battles (not Chao Yun Fat) but nowhere near the good), from Jet Li and the acrobat battle company. So they were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The tap fight was interesting and funny, since this was something quite unexpected in the Jet Li movie for me, even more so on the Jackie Chan line. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even Enforcer because of this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Category 4 Martial Arts Rating 3 for a total score in the movie
