The film appeals to the audience because of the charisma of Ben Stiller and the fame of Jay Anniston. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there is nothing successful in this film. <br /> <br /> Polly played very well by Aniston, no doubt. This is a personal type that fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same disturbing person as in "Meet the Parents", but the scenes in this film are few compared to the above title. <br /> <br /> The text is very poor with nothing special at all. Using these actors who get good salaries, things can get a lot better - but what can they do when there's a story and a bad knife. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
