What a terrible film, awesome! One of the worst films I have ever seen. I usually like movies like this, everyone "a man meets an eccentric woman loves her, but he happens to have been involved with someone who does not fit him ....". I expected something predictable and did not mind. The movies are always entertaining and they combine the right size of romance and comedy, but not this! Every single joke falls and "romance" makes me want to vomit. Personality The title is one of the most "kill me please" characters I have seen on television, "The Eccentric Woman" is not eccentric, very similar to the strange and disturbing. "The Other Person" is the most rational and mature person in this film, but it also happens to be troublesome. These films suck heavily, there is no way to beat them, and do not waste your time.
