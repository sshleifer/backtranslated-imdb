The film is very outdated with a terrible dialog box, vulgar and scruffy and very bad structure. In addition, Casavets and Falk constantly exaggerate. A false film "good". It does not take time to discover the extent of Turkey's intellectual disaster. The first scene is a holistic cavity, full of historic and hysterical exchanges. Sound is terrible. Camera movements are without imagination as well as building characters. No hair, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors smoke constantly and see advertisements for beer drinks. Very cheap, in fact. (One exception: Ned Beattie's brilliant and simple way to play successful man).
