After seeing both King Assad and the Lion King II and enjoyed them. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment ! Disney must be desperate for the proceeds. <br /> <br /> Especially after they lost the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just chose some of the footage that was left on the floor editor (or trash can) and pasted it together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both had strong story lines. <br /> <br /> This film hardly ever has a story. Although characters and animations are always fun to take a look at, there is not enough material here to get a movie. It was possible that some bits would be good packing materials for the second CD in the original presentations. <br /> <br /> Disney - Shame You have to throw this trash in order to make a quick profit! <br /> <br /> Next time take the time and effort and put our work to work.
