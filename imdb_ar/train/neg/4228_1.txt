I can not believe how bad this piece of trash is! I want my return $ 3.99! Words defy description of this bad waffle piece! Dubbing in any form or shape aligns with the actor's mouths. The film looks like it was filmed with an old video camera dating back to the 1970s. I have filmed better movies using my mobile phone camera. Gore is laughable because of an incredibly silly conspiracy. Acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and started ripping completely, then tried to play in the garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I love zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this film that they are inaccessible. Avoid!
