A vampire movie about a lesbian couple on vacation who reside based on what they think is an empty manor house but really uses as a pair of lesbian vampires. While vampires bring casual victims, the couple continues their work until the two groups get stuck. <br /> <br /> A great-looking movie with two very exciting women because the vampires have nothing beyond the eye candy that they did not bring forward to recommend this cult movie. Yes it's a sexy vampire story. Not interesting after women. To be honest there is a reason I was seeing the footage of this movie in horror books and magazines looks great, but otherwise ... <br /> <br /> For those who want to see only sexy vampires.
