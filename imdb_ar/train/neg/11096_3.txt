I had great hopes in this film, because I thought that CLEAN, SHAVEN (the first film for Carrigan) was very impressive, the most accurate movie film budget I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Completely nonsensical and flat. The scene after scene seems to be mixed randomly in this mix, without much thought in narration or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why do you pick up the trick at the airport if you want to escape this life? Why not pick up tricks when you need money in Seattle? Why should we see her hair dyed to what is almost exactly the same color? Why does Claire accept some Jones and not others? The director does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> Everything seems improbable (though I understand that this was not the case) and filmmakers carried a camera on it just as if they were making a verite documentary. <br /> <br /> After the show I saw, Kirigan defended his lack of narration options by condemning the narrative as a political conservative. It seemed to teach us to speak. I think it was an absolute copy. <br /> <br /> I feel sad because a filmmaker like CLEAN, SHAVEN will continue to produce a lame movie like this and then defend it with tired old "political" clich√©s.
