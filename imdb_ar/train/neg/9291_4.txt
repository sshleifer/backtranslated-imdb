I can not believe that no one of the official reviews of this film warns people that it contains two scenes of disturbing sexual abuse. It seems as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior as sexual behavior but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as in the case of women who are under attack and pressure again and again, and men never take responsibility for their actions, nor anyone else. One man was stopped from completing the assault when someone threw him into a trap, but he was only reprimanded by "You can not force a woman to love you" instead of "You should not force a woman to have sex, not to shake" ... from a woman's point of view , The film is let down. It is a kind of "throwing of the bone" on women who leave both warriors and skilled leaders, but the film is far more familiar with romance - characterized by the idea that human sexuality must involve a defect in power, where men dominate the women they love. This great martial arts fighter does not use any of her combat skills to try to repel the attackers. It does not make them ever apologize - instead, SHE looks apologetic. Overall, the film is depressing and annoying, with some brilliant movies and some wonderful fighting scenes, but not the same hero quality of a long shot.
