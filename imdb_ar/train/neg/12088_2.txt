I read reviews of this movie and it was generally good so I thought I should see it. I am a fan of Francophiles and great art, but I think this is another case in which critics make something "intrusive" or "literate" about something that is not. I would be frank: it contains scenes of sexual perversion I did not want to see before. Obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological problems, but I really do not want to see them graphically displayed. The film, in essence, is disgusting. I mean, when I saw a Mass for a Dream, I was danced by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not close to any kind of disgust and disgust I felt during this film.
