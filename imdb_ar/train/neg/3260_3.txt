Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a terrible movie. Bad writing, over-acting, and just silly. It is said ... it is actually a fun film on some level. Demands to watch this film in a group with a large amount of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus conquers Mars" or "Yor, Fisher of the Future" ... very bad, it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie will be a view to watch. It's artificial. it is fun. It has a theme of sousse. If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors that some studios are exploring the possibility of a new edition ...
