I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can not figure out why I bought the rights to this movie, it's so boring that I felt I was watching it for 3 hours. Some say in the plot summary, "But what the devil does not know is that he is connected to the naughty tourists." Well, it seems they did not bother him in the film, just me. About this film is the actor who plays the devil, I love the bad movie, but it was boring.
