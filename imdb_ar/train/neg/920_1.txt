seriously. I just finished showing the first image of Demonicus and the words failed. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw the name of the band Charles Band in a movie, and my heart racing. Was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. It was the stronghold of hope for the little man. The guy who got his movies into the video store instead of the multitasking, but it still shook off more than the junk we had to carry. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> California's clear walking route doubles in the Alps and the abandoned train tunnel is supposed to be an "old cave". I mean, they did not even try to wear clothes with algae or photographed in a way that might suggest it was something other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demon wrestler, as the cover suggests, we deal with a man wearing the latest Wal-Mart Halloween clothes. There is a wonderful-looking body, which sometimes comes to life to embody his fingers and vibrate, but he does not even learn to stand until the last five minutes. Why can not you be a villain? Instead, we have a freaky boy with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> The Charles Band ... You should be ashamed that your name is attached to this ketchup. I love movies so bad, it's good. Hell, I sometimes enjoy the dust that is so bad, it's very bad. This one, however, is simply inaccessible. An ideal example of making a buck, instead of making a high-quality film.
