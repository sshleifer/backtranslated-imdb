I think Jason Lee has enormous potential, but this was the wrong car that I tried to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy awful. I laughed twice, I think in order to feel comfortable, because in the past, they were fairly lame jokes. I found myself scared of Fletch's future, and I had to sympathize with myself because the film was defective and not mine. <br /> <br /> Julia Steeles and Selma Blair are two neighbors, but I would recommend looking at the still images on this site to find out, instead of this movie. Save your time. One Star.
