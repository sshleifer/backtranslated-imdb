Send stereotypes of clicks that are less slanted than supposed entertainment. Gareth Graham, Michael Lerner, Zan Busby, and actually all the actors are lost. Many lame jokes, and every punch line is a good telegraph. The steamed ships come at a rapid pace, and almost everyone drops like flat grapes. The music numbers contribute only to the boredom of the entire film. Another negative is a total phobia within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid it and look for one of the really funny "Lampoon" movies like "Golddiggers National Lampoon's" - MERK
