Somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. After seeing him, I would call it anything but. The purpose of this film eludes me. The whole conversation was superficial and very silly. Many of the groups seemed to be later ideas, and despite all the nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing controversial about this film ... All that leaves me wondering just what about this thing! The title hypothesis may be essentially a fun comedy (if it is politically incorrect). Instead, we dealt with cheap, incomplete, incomplete, corrupt and strange scandals. If you want it, I'll go buy a CD-ROM grace.
