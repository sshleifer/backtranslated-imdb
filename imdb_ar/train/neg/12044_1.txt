I went to see the film "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to public opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. Start. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and enhanced every five minutes or so thereafter. So it is safe for American men to see this film. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy has always had her hair and makeup impeccable. She looked wonderful in all her short scenes, all of which may have been filmed all the same day, one after the other, where the director said, "Well, look pretty now ... well, now look scared ... good ... now look depressed ... Well ... now look interested ... good ... now look nice again ... good ... "<br /> <br /> Most of the Greek man and Trojan horses had British accents. Those who have American dialects were unable to act. <br /> <br /> Trojans appeared to be quite like the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not shine the camera. <br /> <br /> Helen's biggest lineup was "They're Coming for Me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music seems remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs are going all the way. <br /> <br /> Akhel had a young friend who was very close to him, but he was fine. They were cousins. Do not care what history says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a full story with just one expression. <br /> <br /> All the Trojan gods appear to have Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in the clouds. <br /> <br /> Greek men did not touch each other unless they were fighting, just like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of additions in the film have the same skin color ... Egyptian Light, by Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were plenty of blond Greeks, a good news for Brad Pitt, who could have been really stuck. <br /> <br /> Despite its desert coastline, the Greeks had the miraculous ability to find unlimited quantities of wood to build fires, funeral columns, troy horses and the like. <br /> <br /> British representatives seem silly with Greek layoffs. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes his expression only when the sun is shining in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers have consistently fought, but their clothes have always looked impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers were wearing underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Greek temples seem to have been in ruins, even when they were new.
