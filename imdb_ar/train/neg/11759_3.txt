For those looking for a sequel to South Africa's mini-1980s, this is not it. Nor is it a historical drama. Instead, it is a bit of a bleak imagination that has nothing to do with historical Chakka, but uses his name only to give a certain story to the stupid Sinclair story of an African hero, a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some loud laugh moments, as if Shaka breaks the cross that is chained and knocks some serious ribs. You know, as if Jesus would have done it if he had not been such a snob. <br /> <br /> True, I've only seen the 98 minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much nonsense could have been better. <br /> <br /> What kind of name is Mungo?!
