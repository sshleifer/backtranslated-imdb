I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC sat through it. What? I do not know, that's the way there in the "very bad" charts, Kidman, Baldwin, and Pullman must be defeated when they see them now. I think Woody Allen would have worked with the Wonderland in an alien plot, and it was possible for Buldwin to play a role with Gusto by Leslie Nelson. I have been back tonight trying to watch it again but life is very short. The few minutes I saw Nicole were pretty hot about 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Paulman played his shares in the trade of the "nice but grim" F-word character coming out of his mouth when a lady of miscast "frasier" Ed as the detective accuses him of killing seems very wrong. stay away
