Imagine that you've been in your history about the movie you want to watch, and remember that you watched an interesting piece about The Grudge. So, in good faith, you recommend seeing this movie. It is the Halloween season. I did it with the box office last weekend, so it should be good ... so go. <br /> <br /> You are in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it ends, and you hear yourself saying out loud, "This can not be the end of the movie ...." But, alas, it is. <br /> <br /> Imagine stepping out of the movie theater embarrassed and ashamed of recommending such a dog from the movie. You think your history thinks you are a starting point for suggesting such atrocities, and your proposal will certainly end a promising relationship. In fact, it was very bad, and we both laughed at how bad it was. I do not see any future for Miss Gillard in the movies, and I suggest she sticks to television in the future. In fact, it will not be long before joining the second-hand goods market conferences that sell Buffy memorabilia, and it will not happen soon, if you ask me. Horrible, terrible, terrible. The plot was not logical; the continuity was awful. It is clear that the complete end was fabricated in getting the "second hatred - the return of the" cat boy. "
