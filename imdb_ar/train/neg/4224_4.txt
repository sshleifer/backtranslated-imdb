Star Rating: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Bit Among the ** Late * Engravings <br /> <br /> In this effort for the first time the man Nick Park and his beloved dog , Are forced to fly to the moon when Wallace runs out of good old cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the shortest feature in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is the oldest it shows Kinda. The animations of plasticine look funny and a bit ridiculous here, somewhat similar to the animation of Mork about the little guy in the box. <br /> <br /> Although admirable, I was not really Wallace and Gromit (maybe it was somehow very clean and traditional for someone of my generation). The only thing I really enjoyed was the "wrong pants" (and that was more when I was younger and less conscious of it, we must say, the pleasures of eternal life.) I was motivated to actively search for this early effort due to its popularity as a result of the huge successful adaptation with the recent movie . <br /> <br /> Technically admired as the first two (all things that have been taken into account!) this lacks the emotional angle that his successors possessed. However, it's fairly good fun as a first attempt, and definitely set the standards for bigger things to come. Two stars, but good two stars. **
