As I watch this film, it is interesting to know how marginalized black men are. The film spends its time showing the weakness of the most visible black man (except for a heroic moment). For a large part of the film, other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film in the background are barely visible. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with them. There are also some fairly visual support characters, three light-skinned dimensions, and some white characters with warmth and dignity. But 99 percent of black males in this film are invisible men. Shadows have no sound in the background, without any result. Such a terrible drawback, but nothing unusual in the mainstream media.
