Well, "enjoy" is a relatively relative term, but flexibility is achieved when dealing with a James Glickenhaus filmmaker. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous things, as it's the best motion picture I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of the pesticide. Other comments have been commented on the suspension of disbelief regarding the heroic mid-aged commando film, but what about making a film in the Philippines in Colombia? All additions are Filipino. In fact, the only character that looks out of Hispanic is Victor R as good as the villain "President" so much! Oh yeah, our Maria Conchita Alonso overcomes madness as rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this delightful dress to the glories of American imperialism.
