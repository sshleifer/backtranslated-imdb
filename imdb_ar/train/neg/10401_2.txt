Dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the power to see it through ... but why ?! <br /> <br /> The first two films are enjoyable and in fact fairly good. But this is very bad we have problems seeing everything. This was a kind of jerks for children. I can not believe that this movie was created at all .. It looks like the props were taken from a bad Western series of some kind (for children) and they did everything they could with all they could. <br /> <br /> What is the audience this movie is for? I can only think of the 12-14 age group. If you are over 14, you will have serious problems with this movie. It is not only slow, but utterly boring. The characters are overexposed (not just a bit) as are the stereotypes they are fun for a while..but they are not long enough not to make you want to toss the tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that will happen too, why yes ... I've seen it a billion times before in any series of TV hero for kids. All the survivors and all the fizzy fodder were picked up the second time the characters were presented. It's so bad ... so it's wrong ... so ... nonsense. <br /> <br /> Well, we laughed from time to time. Not only in the stupid conspiracy holes, but some scenes where they deserve a re or two ... or one scene, where two children flaunted themselves in one of the obvious feedings of the vibration .. It's really a wonderful sight we made over and over again and laughed heartily. It still makes me smile when I think about it. But this happened only once, unfortunately. This is when a gunman appears to be "poking" and outperforms his role in a wonderful way ... and this is one comment: "They are starting from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we cry with laughter. But then .. nothing can top that .. (?) .. So it's pretty much out there. <br /> <br /> So the peaks here are diabolical problems and exaggeration. If someone tells you that this is a good movie ... it is either a "plant" or a plant or a very evil person. This movie must have the worst tremors yet. Looking forward to seeing the 3 tremors, it is bound to reach the box office compared to this ... this ... * horror cry * no .. I will leave it at that.
