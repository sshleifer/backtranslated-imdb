I am very open to foreign films and I like to understand what I'm trying to accomplish even though some things get lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film was boring. I've often thought about how fun it would be to produce a movie that only shows a normal day or a useless period of time. Now that I have seen such a film, I no longer think of these lines. There are ringtones about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. When I see South Park, it really makes me feel emotional. The closest I felt to one of the emotions during this film was the yawn I felt after the first five minutes. The film was modeled seven or higher because I love every movie. This movie was given one.
