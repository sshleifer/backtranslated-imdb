I went to this film believing that it had good ratings. First, it is ironic that they are already shooting a film in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the film seems dated. Even for 2001, the film looks like it's made with a shoe chain budget. There is a scene where a taxi man beats to show how you can get a low budget. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he is doing in the film. And end up giving a long monologue at the end. If the film had bright sparks during this scene, I missed it while I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt is like a devil. She is dressed in inappropriate and twisted clothes with random children. As for Alec Baldwin, you should not miss a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time. What a loss of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Go home and write better!"
