I really can not say anything bad or good about this thing. Her characters are sufficiently loved, produced and designed efficiently, and their professional appearance (except for those cheese-savory suit). However, it has no originality, no ideas, and nothing you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON, and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cracking cookies, "flick off drones for companies in the deep space versus the unstoppable monster." Pretty much a waste of time.
