The quality of the replacement of this single film is that it was bad enough to be a comedy. Everyone in this film is like the porn industry. I've actually seen acting better in low budget porn. Although I actually hired some kind of gay porn movies after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You're watching you (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first sequence of actions illustrates how horrendous production is, but in fact it's funny: good men have transformative weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 Replica! And then, to top everything, they do some exchange of weapons between the scenes with two M-16s !! I think they have a budget shortfall for guns, not enough to get around good people and bad guys. The fighting scenes are poorly coordinated and fake like all hell. You have to remove the pin / spoon from the grenade until it explodes on its own. You can not fire a shoulder-launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter. The weapons they throw do not suddenly appear. When the gun comes out of bullets, it is still thrown away from the stupidity. Unless you have any idea how to reload it .. The large slow trucks that roam the first gear make embarrassing motion scenes. I really can not believe movies like this actually produce. This movie will be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
