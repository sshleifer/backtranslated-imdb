Words can not describe how this film is completely inappropriate. It's a series of unusual random passages about everything from Batman's stupid parody to a man he gets with a dead lady (really annoying). The only interesting thing remotely in Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this film. Also, the NC-17 was classified, leading to the removal of the only people who might tolerate it.
