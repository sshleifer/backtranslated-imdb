This is one of those films that should have been much better than it turned out. I'm afraid that I think the format that was approved by the Blockbuster should be the format, because reducing the output to the DVD was a set of epic proportions. Of course, do not expect to be "Godfather", but may be a row or representatives at hand. <br /> <br /> Also, there were a lot of nice guys in this movie, but they were underutilized. I love watching a group of hotties wandering around in their BVDs like the next guy, but I even have the right to expect more. It was not a complete loss, at least we got a peek at Drew Fuller Scrap (Covered) and really scaled down. Huntley Ritter looks even more violent than he did in "Bring It" (and also acts). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look hard for it. Sometimes, you must use the pause button.
