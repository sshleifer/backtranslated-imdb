When someone re-produces a classic movie, re-issuing the film is always unfavorable compared to the original. Also, there is a possibility that the new version will be so different that it is very unfamiliar to the masses. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 television version of Double Compensation includes almost identical scenes and dialogues like the original 1944 version. The main difference is that the new version does not contain any energy at all. Fred McMurray was as great as a corrupt insurance agent and Walter Linf was originally; Richard Crenna seemed a weary world and tired. Bring Edward G. Robinson Energy is a great obsession for his role as head of the McMurray Barton Keys team. It seems Lee Jie Cobb, a good actor, almost bored of the proceedings. Samantha's rent is just as wrong as being Phyllis Detrichon stab in the back. While Barbara Stanwyck was superb in this evil role, the rent is extraordinarily courteous and polite and seems out of reach. <br /> <br /> Robert Weber, in the role of the old Richard Gaines as head of the Robinson Norton team, John Fiedler took the role of Porter Hall as a critical witness, bringing some life into the film. In particular, Webber reinforces Norton's role well in the context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the movie starts, it's all just a kind of lies, without any life or electricity. This one film should not have been reproduced again.
