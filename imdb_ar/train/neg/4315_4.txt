Seriously, the only good thing about this year's ceremony was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was very short, it was rather boring. I think it is time to look for a new outlet and producers for this show, which can come up with something really new. It is very clear that they tried to make the show more "attractive" and attracted to a younger audience this year by allowing Beyonce to perform and allowing P. Diddy and Prince to introduce a class. Also allowing Chris Rock to be the presenter was an attempt to reopen the concert and make it more attractive. None of them worked. <br /> <br /> Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he was not really well advance. I actually saw him as just a man who just spoke from time to time among different groups. His presence was not as "great" as Billy Crystal did for example. <br /> <br /> Awards were sometimes too stupid. Not everyone was allowed to come to the podium but also the distribution of some awards in the middle of the theater was quite strange. <br /> <br /> However, I can not remember being satisfied with the prize winners. None of these films have swept the awards as they have for the past two years. Does that mean it was a good year for films with lots of contenders? I do not think so. I think most of the films will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, except for "Million Dollar Child" and "The Passion of Christ". I certainly do not agree with every award that has been distributed this year, for example Caleb Deschanel should have won the Best Film Award, not that I do not like the work of Robert Richardson, he has already done some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschamps deserves more award award. I also wanted to watch Jim Miller and Paul Robel win Best Editor and John Debney for Best Music. But well, there's no way the Oscars can satisfy everyone of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also funny to see that most of the award winners were more nervous than the candidates and the winners. Did the prince say any of the candidates' names immediately? Was Shun Bin a sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope to miss", air irons were the best bidders at night. <br /> <br /> Overall a very forgotten show but with two beautiful winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
