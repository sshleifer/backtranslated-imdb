I would like to include this film under the genre of horror film. I did this because I am not aware of what is called a horror. Since the horror type closest to the terrible I decided to put it in this category. The representation was amateur. You know who the bad guys will be in the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Film students should take this film as an example of a lesson that should not be done in the film. It's so bad. A bad word man is an understatement. The villains kidnapped the ocean ship and want $ 10 million. They want to hand over money on the populated Rose Island in the central Pacific. They were sitting duck after they got the money. There is no getaway plan. How stupid. Director of the former female cop cruise, Navy seal, Kung Fu I am afraid. The funny part is the way the ticking bomb fuses. He says he knows what he is doing and continues to pull all the wires one by one. Then puts it in his pocket and according to the film with all the contacts in place. is he crazy? Also mad at us who saw this ridiculous. If you have M-I-L you do not like. To annoy them rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it. I assure you that she will tell your wife that you have a bad taste and that her son / daughter married someone below her family level.
