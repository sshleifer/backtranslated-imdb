It is difficult to criticize this film, because I do not like the story itself, and there will be no amount of good behavior that saved it. Think of "advancing Arizona" in the middle line. The acting is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly has outstripped the top (but not enough to make this film nice in the camp) as usual, coming somewhere between "misery" and a cynical DMV officer. The rest of the cast and their eyebrows are permanently knit in panic, either from the stress of their parts or from stress in a whole sterile exercise. A real humiliating couple of hours of film. Daryl Hannah spends most of the film weeping so hard that it can not be understood. I hope to tell you how it ended, but I came out, sorry.
