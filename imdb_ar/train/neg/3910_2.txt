Isabelle Allende's musical magic story has been sabotaged by three generations of aristocratic family in South America. It was not a comfortable feeling in his skin caused by the film - which is largely due to a wonderful group of Angelo's representatives who are quite capable of tolerating the elusive Latin adaptations of Allende's characters, and the scrawny Scandinavian hand - very uncomfortable in his skin. To the theater again to make sure I did not miss something vital might change my mind. To my disappointment, nothing missed me. Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Claus and Vanessa Redgrave could not escape the trap set by director Billy Auguste. They all looked very solid and resigned, as if they had made the least effort. They expected to fade away unnoticed in beautiful time groups. It is strange that the designer of the production is allowed to leave the status of KFC products prominently in a scene that takes place around 1970 - years before the emergence of KFC. At that time, she was known by her original name: KFC. Even if it was pardoned, what would KFC do on the ground in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not reach South America until the early 1980s. The House of the Spirits was supposed to be the 1993 film event. Since the film was immaculately animated by his vague idea of ​​what the novel was about, Miramax had to market it as a technical film. As a result, neither event nor art. For this reason, Isabelle Allende was charged with rape.
