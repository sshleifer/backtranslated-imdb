I'm a fan of the real kind of crime, but I could not sit through this rotten piece. It was as if Dahmer was aiming at erotica, down to pornographic soundtracks. There was no look at what Dahmer made ticks, not to explore for his victims. Nothing but "see how creepy this man is." I have to give this filmmakers a lot - their Dahmer is the most absolutely wonderful thing to insult the screen.
