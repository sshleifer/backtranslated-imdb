Includes virtual reality, the potential of computers, the connection to the past, the constant struggle to express your identity in a restricted community, and the wonderful Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the wonderful Tilda Swinton, this film should have been great. But it is lousy, terrible if you are considering the potential! The actress - aside from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - deviates from acceptable to horrific. Little is said about the creation of the plot - the modern-day programmer is a boring personality of one character, but half the film spends on setting up her character, and then when Ada finally shows up, it narrates her life events, not to make an attractive story (Swinton almost pulls this off, though From). You will never fully recognize them as a real person, but simply a symbol of a graduate student's history paper. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, such as digital dog and birds, are poor and scattered, considering that they were 1997 and not 1985. Finally, the script is very bad. Bad dialogue often - especially between the battles between the programmer and her friend, which made me feel upset - cold and distant figures, and a zero attempt to create a sense of wonder. Programmer successfully contacts someone in the past! just awesome! But he seems hardly to surprise anyone, says her boyfriend: "Well, be careful." (Although we did not give any idea at that time or later why it was so dangerous, it does not seem to be too dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Also, although it concerns computers and Ada Lovelace and her love for mathematics, Obviously, no one involved in the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these topics come in the form of a complete jumbo that defies any suspension of infidelity. <br /> <br /> One scene at the end of the film is very good, a monologue written by Tilda Swinton to express her sadness over the fragility of life but her joy in that life. This film is moving, emotional and impressive, and has been dropped from another film. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed in this movie, because it's a missed opportunity for a wonderful little cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may want to hire it, but you should be warned. See Orlando to see another, much better study of gender roles in history through the wonderful performance of Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end Ada asks that her memories can not be preserved (in what I thought was the best scene in the film). But it seems that the modern-day programmer does it anyway, and transmits memories to her little gestures (hence the title of the film). Am I right, that the programmer violated the wishes of Ada without struggling for it? Or is this another confusing point of conspiracy that has been misinterpreted?
