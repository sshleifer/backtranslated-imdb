As far as B movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, so it becomes incredibly annoying to sit down. A single high school student is a loser, is constantly picked up by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking on his mother in a recycle bin having sex with a drunken underdeveloper. The child is then chased to a nearby cornfield and killed. Apparently, the spirit of the children was transferred to a scarecrow that then turned to killing the young men who tortured him as well as the teachers. This Scarecrow, in addition to having a quick lining for each victim, can also turn a matrix-like variant into the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did it always seem like a rotten body? Just like two unnecessary supplement afterwards, this is not even worth laughing at.
