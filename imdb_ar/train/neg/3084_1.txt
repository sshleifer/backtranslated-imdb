This is the result. A piece of trash can not even be rated as a movie, it's just a bunch of things on a reel film, and that makes no sense at all. Back to the actors, who seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little money together and were trying to make a movie that would be a terrifying horror film. Well, it's a big horror anyway, so what's more to be a movie. There are a lot of horrific acts in "Hobgoblins", but the worst is the main man named Richard, who is just a very weak way to the root of some kind. Well, when you receive a bunch of friends and try to make the movie scary, on less than a volatile budget, not less, that's what will happen. Well, the MST3K version was at least a joy. But this film is still terrible, and worth all it gets. 9 for the MST version.
