It was seen on Hulu (too many commercials!), So he broke this trend but even so, it was like watching a very bad friend movie from the early 1960s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where Jerry Lewis plays. If you are Indian, I will protest against portraying all males as a lantern and all women as hostages. They cheated on western music videos and used many Western models so that the males could touch them. I usually enjoy Hindi movies a lot, but that was very disappointing, especially for the modern Indian film. The story does not take place in India (Uncle continues to indicate when Mac will return to India) but I can not tell where this is supposed to happen.
