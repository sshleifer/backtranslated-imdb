This film is very poor. The representation is immaculate and completely forced. Moreover, by filming the film as a dramatic document that does not necessarily make it more believable, you can not easily get out of it, Mr. Deer. Do not let my comments mislead you, because I recommend you watch this film, because it shed some light on the psychology or psychology that is not behind the perpetrators of these crimes. However, the climax of the film is completely garbage! There is no other way to put it! It is pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere! What is happening does not translate to me any feelings of despair, panic, fear or dread that one will surely face in such terrible circumstances. No, it lets you unzip, "Is this?" Leak out of your tongue, not in any way you are haunted by these boys actions. Instead, you feel embarrassed about another movie that started with possibilities, but ended up falling on its face in the most important points. Today really zero .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
