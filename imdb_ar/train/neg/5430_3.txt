Priyadarshan - Whenever a person hears his name, his first thought will be "comedy." This is what this man is known for, or rather known to have been. After making great comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his boat slowly came out through films like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose name I can not remember at the moment. Now with ugly films such as Dhol, the first word that comes to mind after hearing his name will be "torture." <br /> <br /> Dhol is a combination of nasty toilet jokes that are unfamiliar, somewhat of a drama, poor suspense and stupidity. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were funny, though not ingenious, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and hysterical grandmother, the acting was fit. <br /> <br /> When talking about acting, I felt that Rajbal Yadav and Sherman Joshi were at the top (if I compared them to others in the film), then came Tocher Kapoor, then Tanushri, and finally two of the idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Conal Khimo was that he was high in his jokes and even in his actions. Grandma, first like a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but silly. <br /> <br /> The plot itself, as we saw before. Four boys are behind the girls and need money, but with some transformations. There is a stupid, stupid and honest "stupid" man. In the end, good won the bad and everything went well. The idea of ​​having Dhol in a money-filled tone is simply an unwise idea. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you feel tired and want to leave the theater. But as a critic, my responsibility is to carry two and a half hours of film. The film continues and continues the same kind of jokes over and over again and the positions are permanent in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law comes to your house and starts making fun of you in everything, then send it to this movie and enjoy. 3 of 10.
