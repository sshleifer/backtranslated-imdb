The national treasure is about over-appreciated and over-exaggerated it comes. Nicholas Cage is not a hero of the actions of heroes, and this film is not Indiana Jones. The people who compared this movie to the classic trio of Indian Jones have fallen dangerously in rock music. <br /> <br /> I really can not tell what type of target audience this film was about. Maybe the audience will love him before his teens, but I found it quite ridiculous. I can not imagine adults or young people to find this wonderful film. Simply put, everything is okay at best. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is unimagined and uninspiring, borrowing its "Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for the release of this film in 2006, and the continuation of this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to easily steal the Declaration of Independence and rally around Washington, DC and Philadelphia. (With no harm at all), while fighting the "bad guys" and experimenting with what is supposed to be "non-stop action" is ridiculous. I liked the scene in particular with the folded advertisement in the tube and it is placed in the middle of a busy road while the cars start without damaging it. O'Brother! <br /> <br /> Remind me of that episode of "Brady Bunch" where they go to the park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. But that episode of Brady Bunch was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this huge treasure, whose existence no one believes is buried inside the secret ruins of the United States, is a strange one. Literally, there are thousands of "invaluable" elements undiscovered in this treasure. Yes correct!! Ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy of Cage and finding what are supposed to be "hard" clues to these ancient puzzles are controversial! Oh, humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Voight and other actors at National Treasure are tough, wooden and flat. However, when working with this poor dialogue, it is difficult to make a 100% representation of the representative. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is a good movie to watch once. I can not recommend it anymore and I will definitely buy this on top, chasing a strange scavenger from the mess. <br /> <br /> Tired if you should see it first .......
