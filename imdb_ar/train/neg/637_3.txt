Good Earth is not a great movie in any way, it's a normal way. It may have been different in the 1930s, but he wanted to see the life of a farmer. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Louis Rainer and Paul Monee did an excellent job of acting but the film went on for a long time. I can tell you the end of this film through the first chapter. In short Wang Long (Moni), a small farmer time does not want to be like his father shows just like him. Both fall in love with their wives just as they are on the bed of death. The movie plays 360 full-length games from generation to generation. Also, this film did not have good actors or funny moments, it was just frustrating things that lasted long as a farmer during a crisis.
