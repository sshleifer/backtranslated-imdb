I was watching this movie hoping to find a nice and interesting story, but the story line was not good at all. The actors' play was not better off. <br /> <br /> Of course Shahrukh Khan was present but was not enough to make this film "reliable" and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I have read that this film was based on the Flaubert novel "Madame Bovary", but for me I did not see it correspond to the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy a dream film and have the right time, not wasting our time and changing our mood to worse. I can not understand how you can get such a "high" rating at an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So it's the kind of movie you should escape and ignore because there's nothing we can appreciate! You will not waste your time unless you love a "dark movie" with a "strange and illogical story."
