When I decided to watch the Berbers, who starred these twin players, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be so bad because the film was directed by Rogerio Diodato, who was famous for his creative films but flimsy movies. Well, the barbarians are an action film and a wonderful adventure that wants to be another Conan Burberry, and fails at every level. The appearance of the movie is wrong. Some scenes are well shot, but the tone, gentle form and gentle look of the clothes and hair that people decorate make no sense at all, even for such a low budget. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with a hairstyle and a ridiculous fashion. He is supposed to be threatened but he encounters him as a clown. It is funny to see Eva Laro Callahan, one of the stars of all my children, appearing in her first film, wandering around in an open fur bikini. I'm sure they want these debris to disappear from the face of the earth! Barbary twins are ok as muscle-linked heroes, but it is almost impossible to build a proper critique of their behavior because their roles, like everything else in this mess, are really untrue. The only way the film tries to distinguish one from the other is to have twins wearing a cloth that covers the backside, while barely the other twin has barely covered its muscular butt. I'm not kidding! Do not ask me who is who though. <br /> <br /> Deodato must be very desperate to approve the production of this movie. Despair is reflected completely in this dust flick. It's just bad.
