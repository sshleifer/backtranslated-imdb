This film is similar to the play "Blithe Spirit" by Noel Coward. The conspiracy of the courageous wife and mediator is closely related to Coward's writings. I am surprised that films of this kind do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a fatal blow but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are too expensive to produce. I do when the script is original. I am even delighted when it is an innovative way to produce a work that has already been released. There were some specimens mentioned (eg Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I understand that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not please when the taste of the audience is taken for granted. In this case, the taste of the audience is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to producing better entertainment films. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer to see the play.
