I sometimes enjoy really bad films ... those that are produced sometimes when people (even talented people) meet with good intentions to produce a film and for whatever reason it becomes a disaster. Such as "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate", "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So, when I heard that this movie many people considered "Rachel's Attic" the worst film of this decade, of course I was not to see it. <br /> <br /> Hey boy, do I regret this decision. This movie is not bad .... it's so bad that it's not as fun as the usual bad movie. Acting, filming, script, etc. worse than a low-budget porn film: the sound is absolutely awesome, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, and the "acting" is funny ... it's a complete waste of time and money for everyone. At least, a pornographic film contains a pornographic break for monotony, while this hilarious nightmare has a man pressing a rotten apple and a "crazy hatter" tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting does not exist. "Many" scenes occur in almost full or complete darkness, which may also be the case. The "writer-director" (loosely used terms), David Taipour, tries to feel feelings of servitude ... but the results will be laughable, if not pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of very poor quality actually functioning as a sexual oppression. Can continue forever and do not rectify all the shortcomings and shortcomings of this truly terrible waste of film. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid the wreckage of this train. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, it may still have the temptation to see if this garbage is really bad as I pretend it .... but trust me in this ... what is worse than I said, will Reject, positively and positively, on the experience (and expenses, if you waste your money in the process of buying or renting).
