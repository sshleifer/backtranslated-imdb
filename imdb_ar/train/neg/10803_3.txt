Well, after watching this animated film and wasting an hour, and after a few minutes of my life, here's the main summary: The jackpot gets out of the box of the Jewish neighborhood boom, gives this three-haired child wishes, the baby misses his wishes to forget what, I think that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> So I laughed mainly, I cried ... but I laughed mainly in the comedy story that came from the wonderful acting skills of nba player / rapper and boy with hair shaggy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to college kids sitting around drinking some beer with their close friends and very much needing to laugh well. <br /> I will give it 3 out of 10 only B / C movie based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I have 3 wishes, this terrible movie will be wiped out and everyone pretends like Hollywood did not waste money making this.
