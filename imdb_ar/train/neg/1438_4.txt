Okay! What can one say? First, this modification is too long at 4 hours, given the complexity (or lack) of this plot. The actors are really trying to produce something from this film, but very little content is available in the available time. Swayzee is really not a personal Quatermain at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in the Association of Unusual Gentlemen, Swayzee really does not achieve appreciation. This chapter with the refined gun of Winchester has no strength, stature, accuracy or humor required for the part, and is engulfed by everyone including a charming doctor who seems by the way from my point of view more convincing as the rest of the cast. Some scenes are fun but there are silly mistakes in the cinema. For example. When the happy team reaches the water hole in the middle of the desert, its paths are visible up to the oasis, just waiting to be walked. Getting out of the mine does not lead to the exit (in the next shot), and it is not like going out of the corridor that they climbed into, etc. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who follow Quatermain is a stereotypical and amazing character who shoots at everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee works just fine like a sad father, who has returned to London and is unable to get custody of his son. Swayzee must adhere to this kind of thing. He can not bear the part of a brave man with a strong heart, a life experience, and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
