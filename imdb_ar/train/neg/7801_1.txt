I will keep this as short as possible because this foolishness is negligible. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever produced - there directly with the entry of the other zombie Schnaas - ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so heavily absorbed that everyone who co-creates them must be filmed. I managed somehow (barely ...) to sit across the ZOMBIE DOOM - but the ZOMBIE 90 is very inefficient - even when compared to the other terrible film Schnaas - so much so that I had to progress quickly through everything after the first ten minutes. Zero acting skills, an incompetent Gore, a camera-style camcorder, a silly dubbing ... it goes on and on. I can not really find one thing retrieved from this trash - I usually find something retrieved in almost any film. It's really one of the worst movies ever produced - you've been warned ... 1/10
