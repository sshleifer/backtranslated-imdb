If you have not seen the gong show you will not like this movie very much at all, not knowing that the series makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> Give it 5 out of 10 because some things make it amusing to help offset its obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a funny shot of the era made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get lots of funny jokes for people you've seen in the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he is not doing his television personality on the air. 4) You'll see a lot of strange people doing all kinds of weirdness just like you see in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because there are a lot of them, but here are some of the highlights. <br /> <br /> 1) Gong Show Movie contains many of the actual TV shows that tire from the length of the movie. 2) The film story line outside the section sections is very weak and consists mainly of only one point. 3) Chuck is actually decent halfway up as an actor, but most actors make a typical way of flattening the top of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you do not have an hour and a half movie you want to see once. Watch 20 minutes at a time, not so bad. But even so, not too good. ;)
