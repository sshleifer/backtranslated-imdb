This is one of the worst films made by Clark Jable. PARNELL was just the worst. It is just a very painful cliché, and the dialogue is so bad that neither Jebel or Jean Harlow should be proud of his making. <br /> <br /> Jable is a Kaaba whose illegal activities lead to his daughter going to the attacker (like gang talk?). She is clinging to hope that he will do the right thing, but he leaves her there - unknown to either of them, my God, that she is "in the family". In the end, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow connects it with a happy ending! They seem to have forgotten Gabel's need to take rap and spend several years at the Wonder House. "The stars are at their best here," says Leonard Malten. By what criterion? Best in producing chuckles? Jamie Break! <br /> <br /> Note: After saying this, my wife believes that Leonard Malten will come back and hit me. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think that Mr Maltin is the best reviewer and person on the planet (I hope to please him). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I did not like this movie very much the first time (especially the funny ending), I decided to watch it again. After all, sometimes when I watch a film again, I liked more and realized that I was too harsh. While this has been the case with many movies in recent months, I still do not like this movie - even the second time. Most of them were not because of the first half of the film. In the first half, Harlow was surprisingly dumb, but at least that was reasonable. But when they were sent to jail, all the clichés were up to a ridiculous marriage scene. The bottom line is that this sequence is awkwardly stupid - it makes no sense at all and is like turning a movie into a foolish fictional story instead of a love story about two negatives. I stand by my original rating (though all "not helpful") and I think that apart from PARNELL and maybe POLLY in CIRCUS, it might be the worst Gable movie.
