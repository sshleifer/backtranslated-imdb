My original review of this film was simply "sh * t written 2000 times". Although this was very accurate criticism, I felt that my evaluation should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I will start with the lead actress; her expression does not change once in this film, and no fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills are largely reduced to her left and right eyes and look like she does not know Jack. It's an emotional peel I think suffers from a lot of Botox. But her lack of facial expressions during the film was overshadowed by the miserable love affair with the main actor who seems to have gone out of nowhere and made him come out on the beach and fall in love within a few hours of meeting the other. The main actor, who needs his hair more attention than he did, was modest at best and did not once feel he was in real danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that leads the ugly behavior is the direction, the story and the inaccuracy in the plot. I've seen more structured ads than this movie. There is no evolution in personality, they seem to say and do things I could not believe a real person. <br /> <br /> This movie was not bad if he was trying to crap like snakes on a plane but was trying hard to be a serious flick so I could not even laugh. I think I now have a brain tumor watching this movie and thinking about all the different ways that this budget and budget team could have been used to create something much better. If you buy this on a DVD, I will break the DVDs into pieces, then burn them and then dissolve them in the hydrochloric acid well. Do not watch this movie!
