Sei. This excitement must be buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible writing, characters less than believe. Awesome Schlock! Stick some B stars at the POs written terribly to try to give it a little credit, but it failed miserably. If I do not have to write ten lines about this film, I would give it a review of the words of words, start with "sh" and end with "it". <br /> <br /> The end is terrible, retarded. Who writes this nonsense. The end of this film is very crowded, and the weakness is as if they had no idea what they should do with this story line, or run out of money. Probably because of the number of engravings in this film. It's good that these actors are on their way out, because this will be a professional killer. Something good for them that hardly anyone would see it. At least no one is important, like future investors. It could have ended in a thousand different ways, but as I feel, I felt deceived by my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this, you will feel like you are wasting time you can never get back.
