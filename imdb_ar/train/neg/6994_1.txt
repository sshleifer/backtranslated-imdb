When I went and watched this movie, I had great expectations. But I was very wrong. This movie was just like all other horror movies. It is a virus, zombie, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many other movies. But the difference with this, and other films, is that the story is a very week. It's bad actors and boring music. The picture is fine but the rest is complete crap. Do not watch this horror movie, go and look at Episode 2 or any other movie over a story. I hope they stop producing horror movies that have virus and spread the virus and make people zombie. We've seen enough of that. The only good thing about the film is when they stand on the roof of the house and shoot at injured celebrities.
