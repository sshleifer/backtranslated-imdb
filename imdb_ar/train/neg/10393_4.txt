Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (The backbone of England.) You were killed in the first scene - that's right, folks. This offer does not include the spine! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as the first Colonel Cricket of the First War and now the beloved Lord Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley is a borrowed lady from Manor, 20 years younger than Colonel B and 20 years after her own boss but still charming (British spelling and not mine) enough to form a child on her side. It's okay, they enjoy Colonel Cricket's full knowledge and approval (so that guy comes on Christmas tour!) However, she is considerate enough to say a little girl in her age (what a gal!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum As the game boy said, equally glamorlessly meaningless like his age. Belcher could not cover him in the story, so he gave him the circus silence. <br /> <br /> Finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire Miss Polonia Teacups, the principal of the Girls' Distinguished School, presents tea in her office with a series of profound insights into life in the outside world just before graduating. Her best advice is: "I went to Nanchiro (the local Statley house in England) only once ... I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, it was not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - it was a good time, your character would run the whole show. Do not write like this anymore. Our loss, not your loss. <br /> <br /> So - through a cast and set up like this, you have to rephrase "re-read the brides", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional supporting roles because they paid good money. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary jobs there (you can name another!) <br /> <br /> Warning sign first: Lots and lots of backlighting. They walk around it by shooting in the open air - "Hey, it's just the sunshine!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: A leading lady is crying a lot. When you do not cry, her eyes are moist. This is the Law of Romance Novels: Leading Lady is "eyed eyed". <br /> <br /> From now on, Leading Lady is known as LL <br /> <br /> Warning Mark III: LL already has stars in her eyes when she is in love. However, I will give Emily Mortimer a prize just to deal with this light in her eyes (I wonder, did they use the contacts?) <br /> <br /> Finally, the fourth warning sign: No female screen is the "lady" Miss "or" Lady ". <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done, I still can not tell you who was stalking who and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that they all live in World War II without anything happening to them at all. <br /> <br /> Well, in the end, LL found that she lost her parents in Japanese prison camps, and SIS comes to the child to the house. In the meantime (there is always "in the meantime") some young LL had been crushed (when, do not know) back home from a difficult wartime place and there is live on the street by Lady of the Manor SHE found him there.) All of the war victims are moved away to recover in Nanchiro (there must be "disappearing" somewhere in these romantic stories!) <br /> <br /> A wonderful drama.
