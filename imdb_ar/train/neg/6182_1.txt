This film makes Peter a dwarf in the costume of Robin Hood rather than a human boy in a Robin Hood costume most likely, and ignores all the personality traits that really interest him. This film makes Wendy an idiot rave. The Poor Captain Hook Clown. Of course, since every Disney production cartoon must have a character that has a large number of visits to the head, they have made one of the "lost boys". The only character not insulted in this film is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? Darling's parents do not get enough time to notice that their children are gone! Probably one of the most important points in the original story and it's ruined! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is an amazing piece of - there are no thimbles or walnuts - one of the little things that makes the original story unique. It is surprising that he lost his shadow and helped him to hold onto it. (Although his shoes are not logical for me.) <br /> <br /> Destroying such a wonderful story for entertaining children should be illegal. You know now if you did not know it before - this Disney version does not have anything important in common with the original story - it's not really a children's story but it's just a wonderful story. This only bothers me endlessly.
