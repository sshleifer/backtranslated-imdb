In this unimaginable triviality, Norma Shearer, 40, plays a wonderful social role in Monte Carlo, in a conflict between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It may be tempting to blame the failure of this film on the boring text, speech or director George Cuckour, who never seems interested in reviving the state of the coma in general. Mostly, shearer's fault is herself, which she desperately wanted to continue to play the "small" parts as long as she managed to get away with it. Unintentionally, this makes Her Cardboard Lover a strange monument to the arrogance of an elderly woman.
