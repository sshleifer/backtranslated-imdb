All X-Men movies were fantastic. I mean all of them, including the X-Men 3 hated for a long time. They had solid personalities (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard that this movie was under production, and my expectations became bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is no longer a bad actor (his best film is "The Fountain", though you will not hear about it when they talk about the actor), and that his acting is not exactly what the film is about. <br /> <br /> The whole movie suffers from a lot of stale characters that add nothing to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), and which were tossed there to make fans believe reading the original comic books. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read a lot of their stories and this film has not respected any of them. nothing. Not even continuity. Not respecting the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motives behind Wolverine are completely stupid and seen in millions of movies: revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting was that the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to that obtained in the X2 school when the Stryker men come and destroy the enemy forces alone, but hey, this is Fox, this family flick will not see the blunt violence of the most Marvel heroes Violence and atrocity. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I felt confident about this film because Wolverine's origins are already outlined in X2. We already know how you got your adamantium skeleton so it makes no sense to make a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally think that Wolverine is one of those few characters who does not need a solid background story because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scars?
