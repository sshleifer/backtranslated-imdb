This film is written by Charlie Higgson, who earlier made the "Legendary" fast show and his own show based on a character from Fast Show (Tony the car salesman). He also wrote James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've seen only by Gordon's movies based on Lovecraft stories, and each of them is awesome. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The elegance is "contemporary" perfectly, which means the shaky camera, quick and odd cut, and wonderful quiet music in the background. I think it works fine here, but it is still useless and cheap. It often makes me think of a photographer who shakes his digital camera in front of actors / actresses and tries to make elegant movements in the pictures (in the hope that something will come out of it). The casting process is good, there is a full atmosphere, a good steering result. I think the main character, young "zero", very interesting in his "whistle." The chubby man is also good. A man who looks like Alec Baldwin, but not he. But soon after the movie began, it turned out that the film was not something interesting: in this case I mean an endless set of scenes of sadism and disease. There is not much humanity in this film / story: It's totally pessimistic, and everyone in this movie is disgusting and desperate, or dead soon. Needless to say, there is no teaser. It is a long 40 minutes long without any comfort at any moment. Anyway, Gordon remains for me one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, I think this film is tantamount to an experience, and it fails. Everyone should experience a loss at times, just to learn and find their way again. This may be the most unusual work and void in Gordon.
