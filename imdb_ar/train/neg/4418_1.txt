This film needs some digestion. On the one hand, we are presented with a harsh outer cover, a story not only derived from the Catholic Church, but rather foolishly and without knowledge. In the inner layer, we are exposed to the story of Orthodoxy over Orthodoxy, and what happens when people follow blind faith that must not be understood. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this seemed to be a comedy. If so, Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he obviously does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are dim. Humor is awkward and poorly delivered. In particular, Mrs. Keaton's performance was volatile and above the minimum, far below Annie Hall's quality and sleep. Jennifer Tilly is a new model of tension, with her high-pitched voice and whining style. All this can be forgiven if it is not in the last 20 minutes of this film, obviously it was a controversial play made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Accurate, spoilers in the fore *** > <br /> <br /> Everything starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Marie Ignatius (Incidentally, the name Ignatius is a male, and will not be adopted by the nun under any circumstances because of this fact simply to show you the amount of tireless research in the project to begin When everyone admits that they do not live up to the teachings of the Church, the sister progresses to become irrational and abuses them in a way that the public believes they have gone back to when they are Memories of virile-colored dark brown. When one of them admits two abortions, the nun gets worse until the pupil pulls a gun. After wrestling away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in self-defense. Then she continues to scream, killing a former gay student because of his sins. The last shot of the dead female lying in a position resembling Christ as a crucifix hanging on it. Can you say "heavy handed?" You know you can! <br /> <br /> I know that there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know that many people have been emotionally hurt as a result, but these images feed on our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck movie. I have heard from the writer and director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow Orthodoxy in a religious way, not intended as punitive. It is difficult to swallow this interpretation, simply because we have never given a reliable view that is not biased against the Catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply anti-Catholic hate, which is in the name of equity and equality, means impulsive and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a film I recommend as a Catholic, awakening to the realities of the irony and ignorance they face today. If "Rabbi Ray explains everything" or "Imam Muhammad explains everything", there will be riots in the streets and Showtime will lose all its participation. Unfortunately, because this film depicts what is believed to be the majority, it is acceptable and even applauds those who share the same sad view. <br /> <br /> I certainly wish that everyone who was a member of this actor was a practicing Catholic, so it was not ignorance that made them make this film. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of his offensive nature, but because he was poorly written, poorly directed, and a generally bad film. do not waste your time.
