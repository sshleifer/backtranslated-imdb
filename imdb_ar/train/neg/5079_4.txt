What a great actor to be in such a terrible story ... <br /> <br /> However, the film and its production are very good, although they were shot in London but are external in Bristol. Did not matter ?? Seeing one cathedral, I've seen everything, somewhat. <br /> <br /> The story however ... revolves around a born man who has the power to cause death and destruction to anyone and anything, if he does so. With just a fleeting reference to the real life situations of mental anomaly, the narratives construct a picture of a misused and misjudged man as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; in fact, he actually avenges vengeance at will. Over time, he came to the conclusion that the whole world is going the wrong way and therefore begins to destroy a lot ?? Just by thinking about it! <br /> <br /> However, the problem with narration is that they are trying to blend real scientific data on alien mental powers and combine them all with a quasi-religious claptrap to produce a Hodg-Budge theory about everything. Mixing the truth and imagination in this fashion rarely works? I fear that Richard Burton had to exaggerate on occasions when he tried to appear convincing. However, his best scene is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal tapestry as they left his house: a sharp, ardent and deadly dialogue, delivered only as Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good support team helps make things look and sound much better, from Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981) as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews Assistant Commissioner; Zonfield; Derek Jacoby as a publisher, Toney, and a few other well-known actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented, where the backback inside the flashback to fill the background story thus solved the immediate mystery of trying to kill Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer with a lethal disposition. Until that time, he was a good work in the work of visual laboratory by Brunel and his English. However, it was very predictable as it quickly became clear to me about the identity of the potential killer. <br /> <br /> Then, they went and spoiled everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you want an idea of ​​what it is, think of Samson and Dalila (1949), of Cecil B. De Mille and how Samson got the bad guys in the end. The last scene is just stupid. why? Because there are at least 100 ways to stop Morlaar's thrill, of course. <br /> <br /> Shame, in fact, because this could have been a much better story and film. I think Burton really needed money. <br /> <br /> If you're a lover of Burton, take the time to see this scene you mentioned above. Otherwise, do not bother.
