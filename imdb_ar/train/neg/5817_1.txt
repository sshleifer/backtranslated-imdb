The hardest thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it. The characters were "white trash", the "plot" of the film was dwarfed from the start, and the worst feature in this film was that nudity was blatantly doubling from doubles that it was funny. Unfortunately, this was the only funny thing in the film. Ms. Jenkins will be the best service if she refrains from using her life story to "entertain" people. It was simply bad. The positive aspect of this film (not related to the lack of quality in the film) is that my brother spent money on this stink.
