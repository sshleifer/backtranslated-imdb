I mean light light. This film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing else. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this stinking, other than that although it has a really good couple of bits, and most of them are not very funny. Nor does it work at all as a friendship. What about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most of the dialogue is so flat that it can not be more sophisticated, less exciting to entertain. <br /> <br /> What I really care about is the premise is not bad at all. This film could have been much more, especially with every last focus on some of the phantom ways in which films are promoted, complete with false quotes from critics. The film reveals the uninhabited area of ​​media madness - all those expenses paid to journalists who always write nice ratings. But instead of exploring what should have been a major gateway to jokes, they devote about three minutes to this area and continue to seek romantic romance for the film. <br /> <br /> The same is true with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Personality - the mystical star that is centered around itself. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she has provided, but has not done anything practical. All these heterogeneous things seem very faint compared to some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is hard to understand what made Zeta Jones, Julia Roberts, John Kozak and Billy Crystal sign on board this failed ship, which sinks like the "Love Boat" restart. In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the scenario and photographed the deal. Maybe it would make a better story. So, follow us and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have in these stars that prompted them to appear in this?
