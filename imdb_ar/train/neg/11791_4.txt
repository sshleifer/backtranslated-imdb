I do not understand this. Obviously the film has a good budget. She has a very good cinematic. It has a nice speed, good editing and very very good steering. Then why did not they hire someone to do a final rewriting of the text so that it would not be cowardly and why did they employ such bad actors who can not get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. Most of the time, they looked good and felt good but in the end, realizing that the film was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I say it's a good production but it's a bad film. Too bad indeed. <br /> <br /> The snakes? Come one, really!
