Since I am from Hungary, I have heard many people say better and better things aboutvevegtigris yet, but I actually do not understand why all this trouble. <br /> <br /> I liked many of the movie points, some quotes really encouraged me, but stereotypes exist again, as in every Hungarian movie, the story is also boring. I loved the first half, but then I started to get bored, then I found the whole movie just BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Peter is as good as always, Reviczky is also wonderful, but others are there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years do you have to pass for a good Hungarian movie ???
