Description: Stubborn, totally stupid and worthless. It's cheap and very lame, and you'll wonder why these demented people wasted up to two months or more to spend a budget (I think this ...) maybe not more than $ 700 to make this film. It was just hysterical to watch with or without a science fiction theater. I offer you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save your time, your life and your money, by NOT - repeat, so do not meditate on whether you should see this movie. This movie is too smiley, will make your face turn purple from angry boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, be a guest and watch this completely repulsive movie. You may actually admire it. (As I said before, if you have a single-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 of your players, a few dolls that you bought in a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I am a gaurentee Make a fun home video of this amazing video.
