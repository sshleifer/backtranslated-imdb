"I Love New York" is another entry by VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing the armed side of dating a brave and obnoxious woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the most rude contestants, the biggest spokeswoman for Ebonics, madness - and her mother - and give them an offer on this network. Many will say, "This is an offer." True, it's not as bad as it was in the previous show, "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's also bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the comedies of the 1990s show "In Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayans imitated boxer Mike Tyson in the "Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens" for an appointment. Mike talked about how good history was, but how the hateful mother continued to ring. This offer reminds me of this. <br /> <br /> The men were chosen and given names to make themselves laugh and the woman dating more - (I think a smart man is looking forward to now that a smart woman will not let her - and her mother - give you a very gitua name, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear Where on television.) But these actors are in fact, so why bother. <br /> <br /> He escapes me to discover what is fun about all this. The fact that this is fake like its newly planted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to get a profit). Perhaps the wonder is - who wants to be with this woman after an hour? Or I wonder if she and her future mother will be on the WWF! In any way you cut it, it is the wreck of a train I have seen in countless times before, so the value of the shock drops to zero. <br /> <br /> No deviation will make this train more interesting, or any difference from any other. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and to those who demand an "end" to reality programs, this is just another nail in the coffin about why it must be stopped immediately.
