The film is very confusing and ironic. The plot is awful ... but on the plus side, the acting is very good, with some good shouts and screaming. Sharon Stone is fine this time ... Not even half as good as your original mind. Murder is not as evil as the first, a shame. It's not an unpredictable mess everyone says it though. Sex is sometimes beautiful while others are obviously fake (they wear full clothes). The script is weak most of the time, but the crowd and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn stand out. The plot twist several times, but the end is terrifying. The tension is always fixed with a huge doll of "Oh my God!". The hunt sequence is brilliantly guided, the footage and camera angles are impressive and a bit of a category is brought to a movie otherwise, rushed. Sharon is a bit old stone for this too. The bits we see were her breasts, at first, pleasures. This time, they are too awful to describe. The movies themselves are fairly mediocre, but they are worth the go. Mainly because the film deserves some good buzz ... with the opening sequence being a highlight. You do not have to be embarrassed, but if you love the first - leave it. Do not spoil the escape. You will be glad that you left this stone without his heart.
