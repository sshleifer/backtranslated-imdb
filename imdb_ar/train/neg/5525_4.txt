The problem with family dramas is that, outside television movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. Those that are monitored tend to be dramatic and about current or topical issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Films that explain or explore the human condition are not common. Especially with the small crowd that will be the base of fans of Miss Lohan or the younger crowd who tends to make films not simply common but financially successful studios. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I have encountered with this movie are a cartoon of some characteristics. It was much to blame all of Lohan's characters in acting (smashing the car, drug abuse, etc.) on what her father did. Although this is unlikely, it is expected that the public will swallow a lot. In addition, there are other aspects, such as giving it to a little male boy, or oral sex, or it will actually provide a good assistant to the veterinarian, who happens to have had something for his mother, etc., all these elements have not really Help this movie along. I put him more into a comedian's attitude as he tried to experiment with one of his "special dramas", then did it for a full-length feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch a DVD and listen to the commentary, especially for the different alternative endings, you can see all this in a sharp focus.
