Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection on Unlike any other country. Steals a dissident pilot (Steve Tuisant) and conspires to hold the US government for ransom with her. So they are forced to send the best man John Sanders (Segal, who else?) To stop, in return for his freedom from a detention center where he should be wiped out of all the information he owes over the years. <br /> <br /> I skipped the Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all post-production manipulation that happened that it would be nonsense and when all the negative reviews and low user rating flowed, I just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF an experience because Shadow Man (not by the director himself) was not bad, and what the hell, Seagal was my favorite star at work once, and perhaps, he could have produced a wonderful film again. What an idiot you were. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, terrifying footage of stealth fighter jets, terrible camera actions, cheap production values, and disguised and unconvincing fighting scenes that have become a trademark of Seagal and boring and sleepy plot do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, once the first time in HOOD (which I will jump on), seems to be the end of his contract with Sony, meaning that there is no more of these horror European movies His next film "Prince of the Pistols" may represent a return to the theaters. Hell, he has done it before and Stallone will be able to do it in front of him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a flight of anger. It's not even a journey of fun. It is a journey that fails to abandon the earth. *
