Saw a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq calculate their time before they could return home. <br /> <br /> This in itself seems boring. Each time this small caption appears tells us the time remaining, this film has caused only a conspiracy to continue. Faster and complete your time there so we can go home. <br /> <br /> I must miss something. I am a fan of war films if they are good. This was a "neighbor" syndrome. A film was sometimes filmed beautifully, but cinematography does not prevent it from being boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And get the "slow cartridges out of the gun" already shot. They could save money and get footage from any other movie with a gun in it. <br /> <br /> I had no sympathy with the main man in him, and I always hoped that he would precipitate causing him to die. In fact, the film could have worked better if he had. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and I seemed to feel that those who were in the armed forces did not like him and everyone loved him. I have never been in the forces, I am with them. It's leadership buzz. 3 stars are for cinema.
