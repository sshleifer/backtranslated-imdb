I was recently watching John Test trying to find humor in it. It has failed, terrible. Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make their programs fun for all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertained" in its simplest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the masks running are not so many gags at all. Children will love her, and that is it. <br /> <br /> Now, that does not mean it's bad. The original opening theme was very attractive, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a metaphorical aluminum bat. It is shameful, because this was already one of the best things he had for him. <br /> <br /> Some characters may be very exciting in theory. With a little work, the characters can work together well, but they are very one-dimensional. Then again, this makes it easy for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit quick. Loops are very busy, leaving little time for smart writing. This is a real shame, because there are a lot of interesting concepts highlighted by the show. On the upper side, though, the rapid pace will prevent children from losing interest, and this is really the entire target audience. <br /> <br /> In general, the show looks good on paper, but does not succeed in being funny or interesting. This is a show I want, but I cant. There are many possibilities that have not materialized. Children will enjoy it, but that's it.
