I was excited to watch Catalu√±a in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was very disappointed and angry. Lots of blood, a lot of time, a lot of subjects for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Revenge appears, a very humane, and not quite beautiful, behavior in countless films and plays, as well as homosexual relations and suspicion in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga tried, is a false tragedy that can belong to the worst history of the film. It is really unfortunate to see Angela Molina in this film. I would advise anyone under any circumstances to go to see this movie.
