Hello, I'm a friend of the Wolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf movie it hits the shelves you're like "Well, the name is simple and cute at least ... Alto ... I wonder why I never heard about it before." <br /> <br /> Start, the film starts with the breast. Lots of breast. The breasts pretty much all these budget movies went to. Who cares about the wolf's impact, just pay the actresses enough to get naked shots! <br /> <br /> So, about mysterious mysterious wolf character (little spoilers forward, but who really cares ...) It's the average everyday biker. Not even looks so powerful, but as the old wise lady says in the film, "It's more powerful and dangerous than I've ever faced." Just by describing her biker as a tattoo-type guy. Very nice. I have looked twice even when they first used the "red glowing eyes" special effect! I mean, my God, that the effect of "making red spots on the eyes with the computer" has been used since the 1970s. It looks plain ugly here! And do not make me start with the 3D CGI-Werewolf. As has been said before, like a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> Finally, I also like wolf movies, as I said. They always build a bewolf legend of their own. Darkwolf also built a werewolfworld too, around some silly legends of hybrid wolves and the old series. But. It is almost immediately after the rules of engagement that "the dark wolf begins to kill any person touched by the girl", starting with random cut. This does not make sense, so why tell us even the trouble of killing rules, when they do not even play by them ... The snapshots escaped from the wolf's point of view with a Sony Handy camera or anything else, mostly photographing the floor and walls. Just add a noise to the hdira and you will have a super wolf effect. Jour is partially OK. But when the wolf sheds everyone's hand open, just by putting the hand on top of the victims, it does not fool me ... <br /> <br /> Truly, the World Health Organization is making money to make these piles of unwanted horror movies Directly into the video, so they are not funny movies of bad kind, but sad.
