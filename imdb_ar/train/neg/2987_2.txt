The dubbing / translation in this film is frankly funny and provides the only entertainment in a tedious zombie flick and otherwise derivative. I did not laugh so hard in my life as I was watching Zombi 3 (and I've seen some bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, the directors can re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. It's totally funny. <br /> <br /> But ... if it is not the fall of the couch laughing at dubbing in the movie Fulci zombie is your cup of tea, you should avoid it at all costs.
