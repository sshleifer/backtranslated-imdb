I have rented this movie on DVD. I knew the film would not live up to what it promised me at the back of the box, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts very well, with the premise that snuff films are broadcast over the cable. However, the main character has nothing to make you feel sorry for her at all, and the end of the film leaves you hanging. There are many unanswered questions. There was a wonderful scene in the end, it surprised me completely, but overall this was a "substandard" movie, but I thought it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
