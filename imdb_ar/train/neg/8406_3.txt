An unforgettable line of short-term presentation. After watching the episode where this line was presented, the Brotherhood's secular football team began to use the line to break our masses in the attack. Rather than prepare / rest, our team said in the back quarter that the rest of the football team was back on the bet! An interesting way to break the stalemate in which our opponents scratched their heads was because a few of them watched. Using this line added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season during my stay at college that year and in a simple way it was because of the fun we used in this line. The show was largely nostalgic, but he still lives in his memory with the internal secular football team "Pi Kappa Phi 1977" in West Virginia Tech.
