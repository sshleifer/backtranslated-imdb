This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be a collision. It starts with a bad girl who apparently kills a group of nuns on a mission. As it turned out, people had some random zombies. Well, after a few years, some college students are withdrawing some pledges. Acting terrible acting from a pledge to a head jock. Things like shouting at his face to do things in a way that is not totally exaggerated, with a commitment to interact and over-doing the whole "passion to be a popular role." What has already taken this cake is the final battle. The special effects are absolutely horrible with guns. For example, the cannon makes noise without blinking, and vice versa. This is accompanied by a zombie to stop animations (why they move in the stop motion are a puzzle), cheesy music, and about 40 pistols come out from anywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is nonsense. Just like many others, you can rent 50 cents in the nearest place to rent a low-resolution film.
