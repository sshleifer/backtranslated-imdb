I do not recommend this film, because it is inaccurate and misleading. It was supposed to be in an Algerian barbaric region. This story was filmed in the southern Tunisian desert (a very different culture, I know that I am from Tunisia and Algeria). She is speaking in the film in French academically eloquent at the university level, while the character she was supposed to be troubled by her mountain character that she never left, so she lived a Bedouin with this kind of education I this context is impossible, the most shameful scene and not Particular respect for the peoples of the region is evil The "femme repudiee" scene is a pure invention of the writer / director, things like this will not happen in Algerian society !!!
