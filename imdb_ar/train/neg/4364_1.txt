I find it hard to understand why this piece of garbage is completely re-wrapped. The only saving grace in all is the body of Ariona in her exciting costume. Her teaser is also appreciated. It is a specific addition, but unfortunately it will take a witch to save this garbage. However, it must be recognized positively for its heroic effort and true professionalism. The same can not be said for her co-star Lilith with her buzzing voice that beats on your nervous system. She seemed not interested and gave the impression that her mere presence on the group was all that was needed. After all, regardless of Ariona's performance, it is really an absolute waste.
