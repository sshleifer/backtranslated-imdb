This was probably the worst film I've ever seen. I saw him with a large group of friends and after it ended none of us understood this plot. Apart from the lack of plot, the acting was terrible, the "special effects" were not special, and the writing was very awful. The only recovery factor for the film is that it is so bad that it is very funny. You can only laugh at the zombie being run over while the actors cast a crappy dialogue. I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can meet and laugh at. It's now a joke between my friends and 1 out of 10.
