There is a UK version of the show which is less expensive than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and a bathroom, and he is wonderfully grateful for what he got. The US version of this program is all that should not be a reality TV. Rather than making some improvements to a house whose occupants could not afford it or rebuild its entire home. I do not know if this offer is trying to show what the poor welfare system is in the US or if you are begging enough. The somewhat vulgar product development, especially by Sears, is also unjustified. Instead of turning one family into a disadvantaged area to potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the whole community where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one house and building something for the entire community ..... maybe the place where you can borrow hand tools and electric And return them along with construction materials so that everyone can benefit if they so desire. Giving everything to one person can cause tremendous resentment among the rest of the community who still live in the same bold houses.
