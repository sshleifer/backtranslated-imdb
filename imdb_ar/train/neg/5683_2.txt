From the beginning of the film, I felt like I was on another Jason movie on Friday. It is ... the controversy that the film begins is interesting. But over time, the film is just a meaningless film about the silent silent killer. I mean he goes under the man's bed without any sound, and no one sees him. He was supposed to be blind after his failed execution but walks and kills people like him. I'm tired of him. For me everything is the same. <br /> <br /> In other words - unrealistic. Lots of mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> The scene looked good with the amazing woman, but only for the first time:} For this and for the two special qualities of the stars.
