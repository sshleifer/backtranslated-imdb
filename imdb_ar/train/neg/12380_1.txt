Creativity in this film has been lost since the beginning when writers and directors left a good story line, just to replace the terrible special effects. This film seems to focus on entertaining children, but he could not do it. Many small films with low budget have the ability to become great films, but this film is not close to it. Fortunately, this will be another easily made, easily forgotten film. Perhaps this film was an opportunity for the actors to earn a little money on the side so their chance came to play a real role in a good film. Anyone with an atom of respect for films should avoid watching this movie at any price.
