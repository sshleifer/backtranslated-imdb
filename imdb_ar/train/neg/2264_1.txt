As a prelude to this review, I must say that I was, I think, somewhat curious about this film .. However, I probably would not have seen it if I had not had a slightly crooked arm. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows just how corrupt a man can be. In my opinion, the worst thing about Springer's entire phenomenon is not the kind of people in the "Jerry Springer Show" who act as they do (which is itself reusable), but many people are intrigued and excited to see them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose To include me .. to what extent was true). If this type of behavior is not glorified (as some may say) at least, we may corrupt our minds and / or remove ourselves from this kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But there is enough soap box (kind of). Here is the slender picture: The film has an R rating, and although it may only deserve that (I looked away to some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I feel that NC-17 (tip of the hat to the other reviewer) Sarcastically commented that the film was just a great excuse to show sex on the big screen). This plot is very strange, bringing together stories of a dysfunctional family and a group of distressed blacks who will appear in Springer's various shows. In the end, the film leaves one with some firmness - and Springer's speech about the need to see the real world (as evident from its presentation). I agree with him there - it's important to know how the world really is so we can make a positive difference. Having said that, let me just tell you - the bad worldview of a new newspaper or the news to know it, but let's not release the good money to support this kind of exciting talent and perhaps the equation that Springer seeks to give us.
