This film enjoys a very Broadway appearance - background, acting, and "noise" - however, all he has. Some "feeling" Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, the picture disjointed, and the singing "pops up" until you are suddenly reminded of being a musician. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unbelievable: Sinatra's fianc√© --- Sure, the sound of the stadium and the sound of the sound were unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Endurance: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my blossom" <br /> <br /> Glamor: the singing of the expensive Brando (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: How similar to Jean Simmons Vivienne Lee's scenes in Havana. It's bone structure! How would I kill Miss Lee in a role that challenges Brando again.
