San Francisco is a big city with large acting credits. In this, filmmakers did not try to use the city. They were not even able to manage the most basic factual details. So I do not recommend it to anyone based on being a San Francisco film. You would not think, "Oh, I was there," you would think, "How do you turn a stray armpit / armpit into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some potential customers use speech and influence on the East Coast. He detracts, but acting has always been competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be filmed in three different styles, at least initially. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. This plot is weak, and the scene is torn to the scene of elegant motion movies in Hong Kong. The originals had a lot of tension and emotional resonance, and they were better coordinated and coordinated. But acting is fun and we see James Hong and other prominent stars. <br /> <br /> Introduction The white boy was meaningless. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and reduced. The father is a curious attempt on the liberal Berkeley - in fact, people, everyone knows that it is not "cheerful" to live in the ghetto - but his classes are the most humorous. Give some good opportunities. The educated and bitter yuppie jerk of the West Coast is a different sort of yuppie jerk than it is in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. That would be interesting; it was not. <br /> <br /> Introduction Hunter Point was the most disappointing. It was the most derived of the three, the most remote style of San Francisco. I've seen it before and I've seen it done better. Even the video game was the best! <br /> <br /> Although there is no local text and no objective text, these characters have potential, and the actors have talent, and something interesting begins to get around the clumsy direction ... 10 minutes before the end. Good concept put in wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, knowing if you can guess which one.
