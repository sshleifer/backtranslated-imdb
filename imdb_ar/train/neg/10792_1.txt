This film offers only the dumbest possible conversations. In fact, I probably did not imagine how a meaningless film, how artificial dialogues can be even an hour ago, but again I saw this video. In a film that does not rely on a strong script, one expects to see at least good, fun, tasty conversations and perhaps some humor, but this film lacks them all. I heard that he lacked them all. There is not one point I like in this movie, nothing. I hate it. I'm sure anyone will do that too. The name aims to give the target audience some ideas of nudity and things, but it fails even in nudity. I do not know how but I could bear to watch this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you do not. The worst film I have ever seen in my whole life. If someone offers you to watch it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave liiiiiiiiiife
