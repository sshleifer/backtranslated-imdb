I only hope he does not see any of the old classics / Cleopatra, or, if they did, they took it as a laugh. The film is not terribly accurate; it is even more laughable; it is more of a "wrestler" (which is at least a well written text and its historical mistakes are clear and well consistent with the story). The most obvious is Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the ripe age of nineteen! <br /> <br /> Besides, representation is weak. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond when he says "Caesar Julius Caesar". Billy Zein is a dense and funny Mark Anthony. Leonard Varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh (who in fact was not good-looking at all) but unbelievable. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning to all historians - this movie is not true in life!
