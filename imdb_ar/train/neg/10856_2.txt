Look now, I will not lie to you, but I got this movie for only $ 3.99 from a friend because he had Danny Philath, the lead singer of the famous metal band Cradle Of Filth. Of course, I was expecting violence and dealing with the highest standards, because this is what Mr. Filth can imagine as one of a series of schemes. <br /> <br /> But my dear, I was very wrong. This film bites seriously, a great time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make ZERO BUDGET), it obviously lacks the fine musical scores of the Howard Stern Orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it's one camera, bad corners, and bad blood. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our star and violent star, Mr. Fillth, is violently killed. Hold on to the throat, spit blood, but hey, there seems to be a pack of fake blood juice in a man's shirt. <br /> <br /> Cradle Of Filth lovers: You'll hear two songs all over the movie, but with camera angles and filming, it pulls the college fun for the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Stay away from that. It's blood, gore, breasts, fun, even a bad story to go with. So, if you like the horrific violence, there are almost no voices (yes, there are hardly any words in this movie), then buy them by all means. But if bad films are not something, avoid them. Do not waste your money.
