Well, I like the gore in this film - it's really annoying. Anyone who has had a dentist will know the cause. The story is not that bad really, personal motives Corbin Birsen have a meaning far greater than most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen misconduct, direction, script, etc., but at the end of the day it's still a horror film. So it's about whether you enjoy this kind of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly the same in this film. Just keep in mind that you enjoy the torture of your dentist, this is the right movie for you!
