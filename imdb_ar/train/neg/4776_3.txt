I had to write a review of this film after reading another comment that says this is Sydney's best film. Poetier has just returned from more than a decade in cinematography and is very clear here. 11 of his movies are listed in Wikipedia and are not covered by Wikipedia. 5 of his films are listed in AFI's Top 100 Inspirational Film, again, not including. Bringer and Poitiers, Rob and the city of the jumps set off to stalk a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border into Canada. It is clear that some of the comedy attempts in this film have failed, and the link between Brenger and Poitier was worthy of attention and embarrassment (not entirely helped by the script). Kirsty Alley (a hostage) was misused and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Some thrills are made, for example when you are trying to guess which of the five men on a fishing trip is the killer (all of them are bad guys in color). I understand that this is the full appeal to most fans out there. I guessed who he was and what I was really trying hard. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Berenger, watch Sniper (1993), until you see Billy Zane swallowing his objects. This is a lot better. All in all I would shoot a 3/10 shot. It is not bold, and it is very clear to me.
