Yikes, were definitely one of those nights where you did not sleep, so I was browsing the channels and shocked this stinky movie. For some names in the cast, I expect a much better film. I was embarrassed to see the Oscar winner. Murray Abraham is being reduced to this terrible part. I hope the money is worth it. The students talked about a fence just as they were talking about surviving a war or through a terrible disaster. I mean, I'm fenced, it's a fun sport, but I've never been that intense. The only reason I watched this entire movie was that the remote control fell under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
