One wonders why this image was made at all: The plot as such is totally unbelievable if not silly. The characters (a single policeman with a younger, less experienced experience) are quite predictable, and the end is completely mysterious and impossible to understand (perhaps After multiple scenes but you must have a masochist inclination for that; the idea that you should read the book in order to fully understand what is going on around it) and that acting is bad. Was it the basic idea to show that French filmmakers are able to do the same thing as Americans in this genre, which includes "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If so, it is a complete failure. It was a great success (he had a kind of worship as the first French sequel killer) and seemed to be a good export product. a stranger.
