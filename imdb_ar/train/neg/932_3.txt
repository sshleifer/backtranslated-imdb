I watched this movie, and I hope something gets better all the time. What is so great about a guy with no passion? * Yawning * <br /> <br /> Alex will never see a passion for anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one who caused him to lose his temper (if you can call him), I get him. <br /> <br /> Characters are undeveloped, relationships are not sophisticated giving enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her talk about how her death shook her because they were so close? Logic is intertwined with this film. <br /> <br /> It looks like someone saw Boogie Nights and wrote this part of the Little Bill tradition. Even the scene in which he "loses his temper" is the same when he shoots Bill on his little wife, up to facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Messi is good at filming a man without emotion - was there, and did it - can you tell Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film was not only lacking in emotion but lacked substance, good text, advanced characters and plot. And certainly lacks my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
