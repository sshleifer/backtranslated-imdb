A Guy Thing tries to capture a sense of "there is something about Mary" or "know the parents", but it starts out more like it was released from the scraps of rejection of these two films. Thankfully, I rented it at a rental for 5 days because I could not sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis is appropriate and I like the scenes where others automatically cover Paul's faults (the Save-mart checker was great) but writing the script is terrible. The dialog box remains constant most of the time and when you think things will finally come true, some unnecessary blindness is suspended for no good reason. Plus the number of toilet jokes that one movie really needs? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the humor is wonderful when it is executed as smartly as in the other movies you mentioned, but this film misses the mark. Too bad because I love Julia Steeles (the ten things I hate about you were fantastic), but even that did not help me sit in this terrible film. Save your dollars and get a rent "There's Something About Mary" again.
