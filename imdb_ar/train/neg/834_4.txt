I found this a complete waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney has always shown a lack of creativity when making "direct to video" movies - but redrawing the original film "New View" is the lowest level ever ... Soon they will be releasing original films with new animations and new songs, A new version of the film we all love. " Nathan Lin returns amazingly to Timon's role again. Timon and Bumba start moving animals from the original "King of the Lion" world on a narrative journey to tell us the original story in the way it actually happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, Yadda Yadda Yadda, Blah Blah Blah ... <br /> <br /> Lame musical series and nonsense animations. Sound talent is impressive for the video feature, but once again, when was Matthew Broderick, Wobi Goldberg or Nathan Lin ever remembered anything of real commercial interest? Generally if you love the original you will hate this. It is an insult because it is unfair to children and adults alike. And that about summarizes it.
