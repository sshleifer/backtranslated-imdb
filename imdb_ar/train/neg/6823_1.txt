I had to trust my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I was expecting a similar masterpiece experience like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I felt wildly disappointed. In Powqqatsi in my humble opinion is only a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of worshiping her predecessor, and artistically - failed miserably. It seems that some producers have collected material remnants from Koyaanisqatsi, hurled them in a hurry, put everything in a slow motion and got some pop artists under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurry up with some usual background music, which is constantly repeated. When Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with slow and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is a long series of mundane images in slow motion (if you see them on a VCR in Quick Preview mode, you'll see what I mean). But the most frustrating thing was Philip Glass. I could not - and I still can not believe - that these New Age UAVs, which could easily have been made up one afternoon by anyone 14 years old on a Casio calculator, were the same composer that made up Skillfully emotional music and perfectly synchronized to Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget trade! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
