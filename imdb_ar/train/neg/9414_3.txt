Despite praising the DVD cover for the version I borrowed, this film was disappointing. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films in that period to portray the mud and boredom and frustration of the snort, but unfortunately one comes away from this thinking believing that everything exists in this film. There is no plot and monotonous dialogue. It's not that a good war movie needs a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films of World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High", has little movement. But it compensates with dialogue crackling and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a short piece of battle (titled "City under Siege" on DVD) spoken in Italy. It is recognized as one of the most fast-paced fighting scenes in any war movie. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth watching this exclusive show. Another stop is the soldier. Dondaro, played by Vali Castell, who is supposed to be "Romeo" but deviates from the deviation. By contrast, Sergeant. Warnicki is a sympathetic man, if he is defective. As he tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer to home." But this last step? One too many patrol ?? He drives him to the edge of the mind. Too bad the rest of the film does not do justice to some beautiful touches otherwise. As for Meredith's portrayal of Bill ... he is a coma in practice.
