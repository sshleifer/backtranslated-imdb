"Fallen" fall under the category of Waste of Life (WOL). I am sad because I am now two hours older than I have ever been. Other members of my family also watched the film and cast offensive comments on the screen and its roots for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie except that it can be reduced to 25 minutes, so it may take a 30-minute slot on the TV without any loss in the plot. Reminds me of this dish which has many good ingredients but when presented it is nice with no flavor at all. In my humble opinion, the foot mummy, which is 42 feet long from 8 to 10 meters long, should have improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing it with many people who want to distort facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes were credible and raised from their ear by their colleges. Later after all was screwed up by evil people. He will save the heroes today and prove everyone's fault.
