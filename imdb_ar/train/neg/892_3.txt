(I will refer in this review to the point where the spoilers begin.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% of deafness, 70% of weak writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first commentator's summary about the lack of diversity in characters and the scope of stories. I was surprised that this film, at best, sadly shortens the real city of New York by offering a group of people and narrow relationships so that it happens to be just inhabited by a Gossip Girl (come from someone who loves Gossip Girl). Some minority characters are written in stories, but they are included in the commitment, while we can see the gears under the film very clearly, and strive to "be diverse", but they are always short. <br /> <br /> 70% is why everything is short. All characters, white plus a few symbolic minorities, are snippets of the concepts of one-dimensional persons. Worse still, their interactions with each other are written in a way that treats the audience with everything I say in the film about what I describe as a "gag": we get a basic perception, and then aim to be some intelligence twist. But even if we stop laughing for a moment to say, "Well, it was a surprise" ... The stories are still not interesting, because they are also shallow. When you design stories so that their presence depends on not only expecting the end, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> The spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The film basically tries to learn romantic stories. this is good. But the romance is amazing, deep and sometimes complex. All these "romantic" stories contain a girl and a boy sharing the same place on the same spot and getting to know each other. Exchange of words, ideas are presented through voice transmission, but they also can not communicate with the audience just by attracting someone to another. <br /> <br /> In the sense, there is no temptation (in the broad sense), no tension, no confrontation and no communication between the will of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other. The only story involving a superficial "lure" is listed only so that the audience ends up surprised that the man (Ethan Hawk) is overcome by the girl who hits her, which turns out to be a prostitute. Sure, his words when trying to pick them up are interesting to hear, and we are as happy as if we were next to them, but there is nothing intrinsic to this story outside "A and B". So unfold, if something like a postcard can "unfold", with all the other anecdotes as well: A then B - that's all, the only point is that these occur "in a group" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the drawing of Connie Island. Queens is the only palpitations on a train trip taken by a character traveling to West Village. <br /> <br /> It is easy to choose movies that play in all common stereotypes of race, sex, sexual orientation and so on. However, the New York, I love you, deserves to be subject to more rigorous scrutiny because of its title. Expect to see the real New York, the real New Yorkers, but instead we reviewed the selected slide of the demographers, and their characters navigated from the OC, plus a few other people to make it look like to diversity. But when we look closely at who these characters are, the whole picture becomes an insult to the idea of ​​diversity, race and culture that the film fails to represent in a shameful way. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with a Latino man with a small white girl in the garden, who is mistaken by two ladies as her mani (male nanny) when actually father. Although the last scene of this part was not necessary from the dramatic construction point of view (it was very interesting to end it when the mother smiles and her boyfriend / stepmother is away), it is disgusting that the scene in which we learn for sure that the father The girl is a Latino, she must also inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, can not a father just be someone from South America? Now that the atmosphere is clearly warm, is the public better prepared to accept that he has a child with a white woman from middle to upper class? Are we as naïve as this requires? As if it were clear that a Mexican construction worker was unpalatable. <br /> <br /> It is not my place to guess where the film should have gone. But in every conceivable setup and evolution of the scheme, the direction taken by the screaming of the status quo, appeals to safety. All of these stories could have been more interesting, even if we had to preserve the individual dimension of the characters we inhabit, at least by not choosing stereotypes. An Asian girl living in Chinatown being mocked by an old white man? How an Asian Cougar attack follows a white college boy instead. Again, I'm not saying that the whole idea has to be changed. It's just all that. Curse. The story hypothesis. Are exposed to piracy - thus failing to deliver anything about why one likes New York, out vulgar. The real way to improve the film is to write a text worth reading. <br /> <br /> I will recognize the fun of soundtrack, the good speed of the film (even if it is going on, well, the drowsiness), and the general feeling of many of the scenes. The film was fine to sit down, and I would not bend anyone about doing it. However, to say that the most important honor paid to non-surface is when the old opera singer (rewrite) says: "That's what I like in New York: everyone from a different place." Well, you will not know it by watching this.
