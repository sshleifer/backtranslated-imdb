I saw this movie a few years back. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I'm peeping. What really gets me is that it makes no sense and that's why it bothers her. Richard is tied with chicken wire and Jarvis begins to come out with a Richard girl while she is unconscious. Then Rafik Jarvis, Tropicador, plays a stupid song on his guitar. By the next morning, the girl shows Richard talking to Jarvis and Trappi, then goes back to Richard and looks at him as he is still tied. Then they play some happy music and the film ends. I mean what happened? Do you brake? What did she say to these two men (Teraby and Jarvis)? It's perplexing and poor to. I can not stand on disturbing and meaningless movies. This was the worst film I've seen since the release of the 90's Lord of the Flies.
