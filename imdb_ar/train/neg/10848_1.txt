By all accounts, this was an interesting film. The result is the strong Cradle Of Filth, the smiling Danny and the "British horror future", I was expecting the Alex Chandon Festival to rise to hype. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is cliche or incompetent. Short story selections were prepared to death (and better) in the 1970s and 1980s. Admittedly, the idea of ​​a "sick room" has sent back reactions in the spine, but as with most of the film was sabotaged by writing and bad cinematic texts. <br /> <br /> Chandon could not write the dialog. Every sentence with the main police investigator is full of insults and chutzpah (the typical "policeman on the edge" model.) Funny, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. Sounds bad. Add a OTT song that acts very loud and loud (Do not get me wrong, Danny Philth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not) and the shows go beyond laughter to the vein. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects on the poor as a whole, with some terrible CGI, horrendous gore effects (for good, Peter Jackson was the best that was over a decade ago with less budget) and editing filters that scream overuse! For bad use often to the point of Cradle of Filth ... man, they should be prosecuted. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the Cardinals of Fair is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build up the atmosphere and incite terrorism and expulsion within its audience. Many of the good horror films produced in the 1970s and 1980s do this much better with much higher gore effects (eg: obsessed, zombies, beyond, erotica, etc.), making Cradle of Fear "is out of date. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon will be able to learn from this hideous ogre of a movie and continue to provide some good horror that really frightens him. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
