Well, first, if you scan Revolt of the Zombies as an early night of the Dead Dead (1968), forget it. It is a "zombie" in a more psychological sense, where the term refers to a person who does not control his will, but instead has to follow someone else's will. The "zombie" here, as it is in the film, is largely metaphorical for submission to the state or power in general, as in wartime. It's a stretch to name this film as a horror film. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed during the First World War. I heard the band "French Cambodian" with strange stories about zombification - presumably Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming enemies. Armand Locke (Dean Jagger) returns a priest who knows he is supposed to know the mystery of the zombie, but he will not speak. So Louque and an international military force went to Angkor Wat in an archaeological expedition aimed at discovering the mystery of the zombie and destroying information before the zombies had a chance to "eliminate white sex." <br /> <br /> Strange things in Revolt of the Zombies are that the writer / director Victor Halperin seems to have decided to change his plan while filming the script. The film begins as if it will explore the zombie / military metaphor, and may contain adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, the gears change and becomes the story of the love triangle. <br /> <br /> Halperin does not stick with the sub-text about Will and Power (Nietzsche "Will to Power"). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editorial are very volatile. It's another old film that does not surprise me if there are missing clips, especially as some scenes fade or break while a character becomes a dialogue. <br /> <br /> In the middle of a fictional romantic story, Halperin tries to keep the reference to the zombie thread, but few zombies have a big meaning. Louque discovers the mystery of the zombie, but that does not mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are ambiguous and confusing - Halperin even uses overlapping footage of the odious Bella Lugosi eyes from his 1932 film The White Zombie, but he never explains what to do with anything. There are major gaps in the plot, including the story of love. Prominent and interesting characters of early reels disappear for long periods of time. One potential villain is discarded inappropriately before he does much. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of hard old B movies, Revolt of Zombies may be worth watching at least once - acting is not bad, and if you have a good imagination, you can assemble an interesting story in your mind to plug all Gaps. But this is the second time I have seen the film, the first one only five years ago, and I could hardly remember anything about it - so it is unforgettable.
