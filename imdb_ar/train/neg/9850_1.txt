I felt that the brain is dead, I will tell you. This is the worst film I ever bought. (In my ignorance I thought this was Peter Jackson's film of the same name). The presentations are so awful they are laughable. Special effects did not stand the test of time and look terrible. Scenario Promotes this type of TV movie, staring at the type of middle distance of representation. The cast seems to have received lessons from Joey Tribbiani, and they have one look and stick to it. Plus I was not confused by one of the movies until I sat down to watch this. Whether it is a dream or not a plot is so terrible that frustration is within a few minutes. Avoid like plague.
