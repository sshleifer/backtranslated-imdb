During a sleepless night, I switched channels and found this embarrassment for the film. What were they thinking about? <br /> <br /> If this is life after the "remote control" for Carrie (and Herr) Salin, no wonder she did not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Why did David Keith take this? Job? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you run the movie near the end, so I did not get much of the plot. But this should be the best part. This abandoned child brings home this dominant girl ... this scene directly from comic books - or cheap pornographic films. She calls the mother to remember the anus and the kiss of the father. "Oh, I did not expect Sanna!" Fantastic lines! <br /> <br /> After that, I had to know how it ended .. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this bitch of hell has a remarkable past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes ... surround it! And yes yes! Child blows her brains! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a TV that you should watch. <br /> <br />
