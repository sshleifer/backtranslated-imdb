Well, it's better if you're planning to sit down through this quiet, pleasant girl with a middle-aged widow mother who has a common denominator with her older daughter or daughter than she wants. Located in Tunisia, my mother wanders around the apartment, distressed, and decides, though reluctantly (she can not help herself), to dress and dance in a local pub. At the same time her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is the Tunisian drummer band. This film is full of stuff. I watched the DVD in x2 and read subtitle, and quickly sent through many of the usual footage of dancing and hiking (walking everywhere) and more walking and walking around in x4 just to get this boring, quiet, low budget flick that Some got some some very good critical praise. Go and conclude. (C)
