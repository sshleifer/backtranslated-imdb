Perhaps one of the most famous horror classics ever made, Halloween features the unforgettable Michael Myers feature and some of the great works of Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its reuse factor is very close to zero. There is an unforgettable amount of time spent in the gloom / culmination of actual events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that you can walk from it to microwave popcorn and do not miss anything at all. <br /> <br /> How many sequences have been generated, I will never understand them. <br /> <br /> Rob Zombie recreates this. Overall, I hate the reconfiguration. <br /> <br /> Certainly, more than all the random gaps that fill time will be offset by some of the points of interest that the original lacks. <br /> <br /> This is a movie we feel we should admire, just like the way we learned that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume this is a classic movie.
