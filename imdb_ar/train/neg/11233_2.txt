As far as I can tell you, despite previous comments made by other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. I've found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It is on the Value DVD label and paid a total of 98 cents plus tax. I found it in a 98-cent store between plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now, do not you feel that people who used large amounts of dollars to issue the very limited version of the Swedish scammers who felt that you were with them ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was already worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I may start to argue with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember this saying about getting what you pay for. For a slasher film only.
