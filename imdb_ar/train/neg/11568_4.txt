This British pot kettle contains one thing: young people with good appearance. The older men are opinionated, the right-wingers who rearrange their behavior all the years of Reagan / Thatcher. However, whether small or old, morality in this mini-series of three parts is questionable universally and no one comes well. <br /> <br /> Nick is a handsome young man like me and a new young man from Oxford. It is not central to the story, but it has a very beautiful head of hair which makes watching this game much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend of his father, Gerald, a wealthy conservative politician, and the children of his sister Kat, while the family runs away in southern France. They neglect to tell him that, annoyed, Cat cuts herself off with a variety of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick sins in his self-serving "gratitude" because of his passion and moves in it, and finds out too late how distressed he is. Incredibly, Nick lives in this house for four years, but since the plot depends on this point, it is best not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick is very happy to be seen, it is unbearable. It soon made me subdue him to the rich extremism climbing the walls. Deeply closed except for Cat (guessing his big secret on the horizon), he likes to have a little unknown sex until we know that he is really an anomaly. Although it seems impossible, Nick takes a more beloved lover than he is. I mentioned in the tabloid. Gerald, in a real Conservative way, has become involved in many personal and financial scandals, so the disclosure of Nick increases his embarrassment. This gives Gerald a last chance to drop the unhappy child intensely. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one short moment of discontent, Nick takes abuse of him in silence and implicit agreement. Denial, self-hatred, naivete, or ignorance? You have to decide whether you can manage this whole thing without throwing anything into the group.
