I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm very disappointed about it. I'm not really sure why someone did such a movie. It was amusingly marginal, but I feel that the people who did it had a lot of disagreements about what they were doing. Monday, the author was in charge. Tuesday, the manager; Wednesday, the man who gets the coffee; Apparently they really wanted to produce a different couple of movies, but they had only the time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Another person commented that the acting was really good, but I was opposed. Then again, if the actors are able to maintain the straight face during filming, they may be better actors than they are given credit. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film will be a mystery ... something like the law, the historical order or the national treasure. It starts like that, but then, without any place, it turns into a bad episode of the twilight zone, or ... what is that other show that was not good ... Bad episode of The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it was completely turned on. There is a wicked man with white hair rising. There is an interest in love, when the wind blows for the first time when it appears. seriously. Once you realize that it is a Christian film, the end will be very easy. <br /> <br /> The performance of the cinema was not bad, especially in the opening scenes - a way to make your foot better. This was not a terrible thing for most of the film, but there was a sometimes ridiculously bad shot of an old woman, praying, arming in a dark room while the light shone - this thing that makes you feel a bit embarrassed to watch the movie.
