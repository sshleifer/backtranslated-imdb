Would not it be great if "Not Another Teen" does not really make all these stupid things useless, I'm having sex more than teen movies? In an ideal world, yes. So far this is even worse. This is not insulting to the stars, it is humiliating to the distributor. All the jokes are basically college students offering things that people may not care to see, but they are "funny". Devon Sawa, who was already good at the "Final Destination", is just boring in this film. It makes you wonder if it's bad on purpose. Grade: F
