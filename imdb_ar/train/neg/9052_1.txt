I respect the fact that this is a very common show. However, compared to the innovative, funny and stunning classic Robert Altman in 1970, it was probably less than average ... even if it lasted for 11 years, it does not necessarily make any good. This offer was an integral part of my early childhood (it was restarted every night, and I guessed that parents were watching and laughing at it), but it is one of the memories I do not miss. Now that I have already watched the film, I can give this series in fine cash. On his own, not nearly bad "2 out of 10". However, the characters in this show are not like those in the film. Some are technically similar, but they are only similar in name. For example, since when was Alan Alda like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is quite different, as are his characterization and his expectations. New characters are not great. They only work to make you miss those they replace. It's the same with new actors (including Jimmy Farr). The only thing that actually moves into the serial is the radar, which remains (despite being played by the actor himself) just a pale imitation of the original. What then? Oh ya. With the laugh path (no matter whether it has been used in surgical scenes or not), it appears to be creepy, because of what is going on in other settings. And because it lasted almost four times the actual Korean War, it invites viewers to this strange rift that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I have never liked this offer and will never do it.
