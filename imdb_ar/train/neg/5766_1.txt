This was thought to be the main work of the open source community, which would stand and scream in the world's media to notice that we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our choices of producing good work using open source tools. After downloading the basic version (a solid fan dies here on the dial-up modem) I finally got a first strike. Media Player and Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box, and then failed to open Totem and xine & kaffeine on my suse server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. It will be difficult to spread the word on this topic if ordinary users can not open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, great camera work and flawless installation. Everything seemed real. Then the two main characters moved ... and talked ... and the film died for me. Everything apart from lip sync and actual animation of the two main characters (except for Proog in the dance scene) seemed fluid and completely alive. The main character of two people was so weak that I sometimes wondered if there were any games on the market right now with intermittent scenes involving less realism. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the movie is awesome .. as a frame, and great if none of the actors move. I am very happy because I did not recommend this to anyone. I spoiled my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a more imaginative plot to devise. <br /> <br /> This movie will get 10 stars if it does not have the tragedy that is there on the screen.
