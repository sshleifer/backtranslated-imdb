Victor Vergas' failure to raise Victor Vargas failed as he tried more to be: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no truth to this film. The characters and attitudes feel completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> Why? Bad guidance. Peter Solit uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. Mr. Sollett seemed to read somewhere that the lack of lighting of his film would give him a genuine feeling. Error! It just gives her a bad feeling. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, but gives the audience a headache and subtracts from the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on display is very painfully fake, as if Mr. Solit wrote his own script with the sole aim of trying to find "hip" to his friends at Sundance and showing how "animated" film director . <br /> <br /> In general, the only lasting impression this film leaves you with what a bad director Mr. Solit. Next time, what about taking some writing classes and guidance?
