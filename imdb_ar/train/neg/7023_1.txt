Well, I and my girlfriend and I rented the DVD (DVD) and after about 30 minutes of the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie and most importantly, do you care to find out what ends with" looks and decided we either need medicines to keep us interested B "conspiracy" or just end the pain there and then watch something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I liked "But I'm Cheerful" a lot, but the mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, sorry! I'm definitely better "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking mm√•l", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
