This lovable movie contains a cult of one of those oral features that I have just seen. It may be hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwestern Arkansas, Fokie, who knows that the legend is real. This story is recounted in a documentary style by Verne Steyerman and filmed in actual locations talking to the people involved. Legend changes with the novel, but during the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, the area around Fok was visited by a creature similar to the Big Foot traveling along Buggy Creek. Because it is a long creature with three fingers and a length of 7 feet, this reckless creature causes periodic damage and is afraid of "bejeebers" from most of the community. I personally crossed the bridge of Little Buggie Creek in 1974, and yes felt on the back of my neck rose. Of course it was around 1 am in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I was laughing.
