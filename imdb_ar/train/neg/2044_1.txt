This film is bad I do not mean just "bad" as in; "The script was bad"; or, "The behavior in this scene was bad" ..... I mean it is bad as someone should be held criminally responsible for its inclusion This reassuring pile of raw steaming is on a non-skeptical audience. I will not honor it with an explanation of (Plot ??) if I can refer to it as such. I can think of one other occasion during about 40 years of watching movies that I found needed to spleen spleen in a movie. I mean, after all, no one goes out to produce a bad movie on purpose, right? Yeah. They seem to be doing ... The Guilty Man is the writer / director Ole Lommel. But even worse is that Blockbusters already rent this to their customers! Be advised. Leave this nonsense where it belongs. Stuck to the shelf, collect dust.
