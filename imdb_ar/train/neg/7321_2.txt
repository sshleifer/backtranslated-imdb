Maybe this is not my type but the plot was awful as it was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Varantino. Jim Thomas seemed uncomfortable in the role of being tempted here (while in marijuana? Why does this need to be included? This plot is pretty weak). Also Sharant Varentino. It would have been better if she had had more respect for the relationship. Is the film trying to say? not much.
