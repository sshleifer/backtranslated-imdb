I got this DVD in 10 Dead curse pack. You should love these package packages. Even if you are not characterized by real restoration and restoration and everything that is new, movies are generally under the full size and format scan, there is no denying that there are always some gemstones listed. In the words of "gems," I always mean that there are some good craps to see, especially if the films from the 1970s are like the "Palace of Madness." <br /> <br /> My version is called "Palace of Madness," but when the title screens turn into a dungeon game for Dr. Tar. It does not matter, really, as crap is crap, is not it? Yes really! But saying this film is of no value at all is not true at all. There are some non-traditional elements here and there, and it is clear that the click has an appropriate budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title sequence is great with its passive negative playback through a cheap TV look. Dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and the buggy driver come out to move the tree trunk dead halfway. "What power!" Our hero says. Funny, then, that this dude should not be able to later fight the fooly forest guards when they come to make fun of something terrifying. You will completely forget that this guy was even in the film until he shows up again later near the end. This is the way these characters are memorable. <br /> <br /> However, the best part about Mansion of Madness should be the strange and mixed-spirited music of good men. It's like the bad cartoon music that a pleasant three-year-old child finds. And why all eccentric jerks, anyway? I would like to say that my favorite moment should be when the cart ambush the horses and buggys when they pull a stupid, homemade-looking ghost with a stick halfway up and the train stops. what a hell? Oh yeah, there are a lot of boobs who can see them, too, for those of you who dig such things. Boobies, bad dialogue, idiot music. The best sums of madness are for me. It's worth at least one offer and it might be a lot better if you have a few to drink or otherwise. I can not say I was bored ever to see it, but I can not deny it was also a barrel of a tube. Kinda like round magic mystery but with a conspiracy, but not. they. <br /> <br /> Mr Chicken PWNZ.
