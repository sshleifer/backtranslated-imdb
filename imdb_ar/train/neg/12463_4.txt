Well, Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Obviously I'm lying because it is. I'm conservative but politics will leave it to me in my film. This film was hostile to foreigners, hostile to the Middle East, and great oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. I saw this movie on the opening night because I was impressed with these kinds of films and I'm a political science specialist at college. The filming was excellent and the acting was as far as I could tell him well. <br /> <br /> But it was impossible for me to decipher the plot. I tested and got an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard my experience was, there was no way I could compose the storyline of the film and what characters it was doing. <br /> <br /> The sequence was not quite coherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is a film that is meant to watch several times for the full depth of the story, which may be good, I have no idea exactly what was going on. <br /> <br /> It is logical that if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism, make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not dazzle them brilliantly, bring them with Bull S.
