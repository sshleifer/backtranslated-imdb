I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave the road for 10). If the film is not good in the first five or ten minutes, it probably will not improve. I have not yet tested any film that has proved to be against this theory. Dan in real life is certainly no exception. I was watching this Turkey and thought. Wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, I do not like any of the characters at all. <br /> <br /> Story of a columnist / widower educating three young girls who fall in love with his friendly brothers. I assume the description line would be "A columnist can use advice"? I do not know, I do not know. Dance personalities have not in any way qualified as a qualified person to advise. I think this is an irony? I do not know, I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and children in a kind of family retreat, which looks very nice, and may be loved for good comedy, story lines ... none of them have ever appeared. The central story is basically how this woman likes, but can not have. Anyone with a pulse will realize that they will eventually get it, but you have to suffer through a painful, life-long film network dialogue to reach the happy end that is inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
