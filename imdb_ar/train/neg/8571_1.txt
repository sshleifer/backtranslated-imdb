Ben takes a long time developing his characters, and we care about them almost. However, there are some real problems in the story here, and we see no real motive for the evil brother's behavior, and the timeline is tightened. It was supposed to be set in 1963, and music was delayed in the late 1960s / early 1970s. References and dialogue is 70s / 80s. The strong peak potential offers itself, and allows Ben to descend. But even with all these difficulties, it is worth watching, but not great.
