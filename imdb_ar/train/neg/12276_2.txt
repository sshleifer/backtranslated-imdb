The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately, collapsed because of a weak / unreasonable storyline, abuse, and lack of content / material in general. One of the obvious flaws is that Sean Connery, who played the role of an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his Arabic name! This may seem a small error, but it indicates a clear lack of effort in attention to detail. The quality of representation was uniformly lower than average. <br /> <br /> The solitary saving of the film was a twist in the plot at the end; a French song (I can not remember the title). In general, it was a very bad film where Sean Connery was clearly bright.
