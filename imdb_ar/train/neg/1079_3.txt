I feel like I'm the only child in the city who has been upset by Branaj's performance. He is a good representative of most novels, but he simply could not get rid of the Southern dialect. I mean, it was sad. It was as if he was trying hard to be Yank. One of the former reviewers questioned why US actors were not represented in this film. I repeat this idea. It is wonderful that actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it is difficult to experience something else so that performance becomes tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he was a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to hit him because of his very nasty tone. Everyone deserves to screw here and there. But it's hard to see something so annoying that you prefer to choke a chicken bone or eat a bucket filled with waste instead of sitting in The Gingerbread Man.
