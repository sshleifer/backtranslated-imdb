I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as did all the other voters. The manager was present and seemed to work very hard and was committed to the project, I think he explains the average reception above and marked it. It's very similar to the Aussie kids "Round the Twist" favorite feature, but takes it seriously to get this recovery feature. The film itself may be worth watching if you are trying to make a global film tour that will visit all UN member states, where I can not think of another Fijian film, but in general it was a year-old film, malpractice (although amateur cast) And prey to subaltern mentality. The moral story seems to be that the indigenous people will try to solve each other's problem, but as long as there is a decent white governor to intervene in, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
