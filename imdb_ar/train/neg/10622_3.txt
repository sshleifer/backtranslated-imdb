I really have the honor of Christopher Lee, but this was not the level of his other performance ... he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The movie does not live up to its hypothesis. It's not scary, it's overly melodramatic, and draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here comes the good part," the good part did not quite arrive. <br /> <br /> Evil is not at all masked. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you were in the right frame of mind, I enjoyed the MSTie experience at the expense of this movie, but .... Na'ah ... does not seem really worth the effort. It was not really good, it was not so bad, it was just modest.
