I can not describe how wonderful this film is. Am I the only person here who finds the ideal way of disgusting? The "men in Rohan" seem to be 100% fake with their bad hair color, and do not approach the shape of the actors. The Orcs looked awesome. Why does Jendolf go with a bad wheel? Why can not they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aroman. There was something that sounded like awesome pronunciation * sp * for the Tolkiens characters. All the Im happy studio who made this pull plug out of the sequence, was just a terrible adaptaion. Go to see the Hobbit cartoon to get the best cartoon for the work of Tolkiens. Hell, so the animation version of ROTK is better then this drool. 10/02
