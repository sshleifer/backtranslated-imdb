"Killer form of love" is a "fatal attraction" basically with the addition of two twists to the back half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films a week. It is another cautionary tale about submission to temptation, and adds nothing new to it. <br /> <br /> Bret (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who encounters a large credit fund. Although he owns everything, he risks losing everything by starting an affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a cute blond from Cedar Falls, is hard for Britt, and she does not take it particularly well when he is satisfied with his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett died in the main bedroom of the grand luxury home she shared with her new husband. When police interrogate Brett, he directs his finger to Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to become calmer in the minute - not that she was a stabilizing image before. The defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and determined to prove it. <br /> <br /> Have you done it or not? How will it end? You can find answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" is broadcast at your local station. Make sure you do not miss the meaning of this beautiful story: men are pigs, and women are crazy.
