You know that this will be a great movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. Made in the 1950s. It's black and white. 3. It has no actors name! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, no one beats you - this movie brilliantly combined all four of the above to turn it into a real cinematic error. <br /> Well - shhhhh But I will discuss the special effects here - or lack thereof - <br /> <br /> Have you taken the underwater scenes? It seems to have been badly filmed through the aquarium - notice the head fluttering in the breeze. <br /> <br /> Repeated reuse of Stock Footage (external house shots and bridge scenes - has greatly enhanced KRAF-Tiness for this film - not since "PLAN 9" - I've seen this innovative use of videos. <br /> < Hi there, there was a lack of special effects - no need to worry - the yelling does not take him to the place of special effects in this movie too.Yes, use this movie cleverly that old trick he hacked. <br /> <br /> Pick up popcorn - Put your mind on a bolt (many fermented drinks certainly help), relax, and wonder: why did they put this movie in the film again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
