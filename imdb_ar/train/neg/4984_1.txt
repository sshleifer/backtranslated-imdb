The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and close to perfection. LV2 must be a candidate for "Worst First Sequel to a Really Good Film". In LV2 everyone continues to yell, when the first hiatus does not succeed is repeated five more times with some vague hope of becoming funny in the end. LV2 is a terrible parody for LV1, except of course that the parody must be innovative. If you love LV1 just do not see this movie, just see LV1 again !!
