This movie causes more unintended laughter than anything else I have ever seen. Really, if you love Tolkien, just hire it to laugh it out with your friends. I will not be the one person who rips his flaws ... All I will say is that the film (for me, anyway) lost the key points to turn my favorite character, Sam, into a wacky fool. Shame, shame ... 3/10
