METAMORPHOSIS I work my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh in the group. METAMORPHOSIS, released in 1990, appears to be a new version of The Atom Age Vampire, which also included a scientist seeking similar results. At present, METAMORPHSIS is not something of a horror film. <br /> <br /> A university researcher breaks the human genome to create a vaccine that prevents aging. Pressure from the administration to publish his papers; produce some results (or lose funding), the world decides to use himself as a guinea pig! When initially thinking that he did not suffer any adverse side effects, he finally discovered that the serum had already been removed in an unexpected way! <br /> <br /> Acting is a basspot; the performances left me with great interest in the film. The result is pandering. Science behind the tests and their results are not only wrong; it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous ?? perfect. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, the end turns into a 30-minute gap, seemingly endless. Without giving much, I would like to call this one, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet with a creature of black lions who meet alone."
