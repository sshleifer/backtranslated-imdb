I admit that I had to progress quickly through the badly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes - nothing happened, and everyone has already described the "plot". But no one mentioned the opening scene - the Butcher knife stabbed through a wig and ended on the grass in the front yard! I think the terrible child did it, and I assumed that he never explained. Truly Triple Opening. <br /> <br /> I hope this is a better written or thought-provoking film, because what we have left of it, if it is a beautiful film and a meaningless film, is not a "smart" movie, it's just a badly executed film. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a copy that has been cleaned and if there are any missing clips, I would like to see if that will help. Otherwise, this is a weird little movie which is best if it is a quick guide through!
