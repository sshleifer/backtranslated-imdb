The most sad thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including Nick the incredibly talented cave) have missed the full point where Cohen's strength lies: by presenting his lines in an almost unlimited balance, Cohen conveys the full range of his hair , His ridicule, his universal humanity, his laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see some of these artists make their faces mildly suffering, they shouted their pathetic cries in the patent effort to shout "I'm a singer!" is a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably heard of some horrendous versions of simple songs like "Imagine" Lennon. Nothing, simply nothing approaching the simplicity and guidance of origin. If there is a form of art that does not need decoration, it is the art of Cohen. Decorated in the street decorations look like an unsexed makeup for sale. <br /> <br /> In this honoring of Cohen, I found myself suffering and suffering through deplorable praise and terrible interpretations, all of which are totally lacking in irony. If the truth is told, many of these singers seemed to have been recruited in some Talent resort. Cohen is honoring them by allowing them to sing his purposes, in fact, not the other way round: they may be friends, or his daughter, and he could become very kind and in a good mood. Very bad, did not stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in the end, Cohen himself performed the majestic "Song Tower", but even that flower was pampered with a completely heterogeneous background. Of U2, all carry the expression children feel bored when they visit their poor grandfather in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Show sad, really, and sad if you love Cohen as really as I like.
