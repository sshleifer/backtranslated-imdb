Some praised - the atlas: - the lost empire - as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for adult thinking. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests the beginning of a direct film, that hits someone with a kind of waste that you can not sell to adults anymore. "Crack Team" has been performed for many old adventure films well before, (I think Dirty Dozen) but - Atlantis - is one of the worst films in this format. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member brings out seems familiar and embarrassing at best. A man of medicine / medicine, a mechanic who was stripped of his father always wanted sons, and if we have not seen them at least before, we have seen mixed and mixed dodgers before. The story is about how one companion, the role of Finney, played by Don Novello (Father Guido Sardocchi), moved from flower shops to completely unprovoked demolition. <br /> <br /> The only major character, Milo Thatch, a young obsessed academic at Atlas expressed by Michael J. Fox, has no depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues to search for his grandfather. The opening scene shows the younger Milo on his knees, with his grandfather wearing a helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> Although the characters were thin at best, the best part about the Atlantis was the vocal talent. Commander Rourke does not lose anything expressed by James Garner. Although Rourke is a great military type, Garner shows his ability to convey the spirit of characters simply by handing him over. Garner's acoustic performance is a high point. I regret to say that "the death of Leonard Nemoy" is no more than compulsory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vini Santorini, was also outstanding for one or two good funny lines - but I always loved Father Guido Sardoche, anyway. <br /> <br /> The computer was an animation. Animated background, that is. Animations for characters do nothing if they do not make the flat letters appear even more flattering. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say a hacker or a cliche. I'm not sure about that. Any serviceable piece can be converted into something new with proper treatment. Shakespeare often began a well-known story and plot and was famous only for putting a new layer of paint. So the treatment is the thing. It is clear that - Atlantis - lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can not start entering all the logical gaps without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. Conspiracy bridges pick up like a twig and a meaningless ending. In addition, the script and animations intersect with an annoying feeling. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Right at the start when Milo reveals Ronic or Celtic symbols that have been misinterpreted and the "coast of Ireland" should read "Iceland's coast", we begin In the presence of problems. The scriptwriter will need to know that the Britons are taking Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignoring the Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know the Viking plot to call the greener Iceland Island and Greenland's most attractive island. <br /> <br /> By making it a matter of "speech" incorrect, the authors have to be doomed to require a rune version of English and a post Roman date on the script. Because this is a long time after Atlantis sinking into its cave under the sea. Without less clear evidence and technique than Milo's, it would make the inscription less trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Shepherd's Journal can not be written before Atlantis sinks, or it will not know anything about the cave or crystal lying "in the king's eye." It must have been written after the sinking, but even without the technology that Milo's mission had, how did anyone get by Liviatan. So how can you learn more about anything then? Why is it written in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Autobiography, astrology or stellar travel can explain these things. But clairvoyance and astral travel do not need to be written in the Atlantic. Therefore, the type of type must be automatic. Because no one in Atlantis can read, the spirit of crystalline evangelism must be on the surface. This would be more logical. But it can also be explained in the film: Milo discovered that the shepherd discovered that this force was calling him throughout his life - appeared in dreams, etc. You should explore this in the movie. <br /> <br /> Atlants must not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects that the original Indo-Europeans will be able to speak in Europe. Now the Romans will understand that "hard" or that their day has become French "ch" (pronounced like "sh", no less!) <br /> /> The present Atlantians were alive before this disaster - when they seem to be able to read, but now they are unable to read what they used to, or to operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> Collective illiteracy points to a critical flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. He looks suspended in the air so that Milo can save him. Although life is not always a struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or write novels, and perhaps a combination of Atlantic school systems that are heading towards the end and the lack of good imagination that caused the fall of Atlantis illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Keda's excuse for not knowing how to read or operate the mechanism if it is too small when the disaster is stupid - but none of these seriously qualifies her father to delude! Kashakim's folly wiped out his people alone. He killed a group of tragedy, progress stopped (not much was killed here, but he oversaw a huge slice of culture and progress) so someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if it was not boiled in the lava first because Giant Robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The blue lightning bolt was supposed to break the shape of Kashakim, when Kida attempted to bring her father's image into the circle of great kings in Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of rhetoric and found a page on crystal - he knew it was crystalline and not some astronomical mines or " Stages of the Sun "diagram. <br /> <br /> If Milo's grandfather had told Rurke about the subject, he still does not explain how Rourke suffered from reading Milo as part of the book. The tearing of the page - which was idle in Rourke's hand, although Milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently - was only to drive the viewer out that "something was not quite right." Unless the word "crystal" ignited warnings in the head of Milo and someone tried to steal it, Milo would not suspect anything. It's just a thick prediction. <br /> <br /> The "double cross" of the crew was not a personal change. We learned that Finney, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie were walking alongside Rourke from the start. However, the "change of heart" falls. It was a change, and it was necessary to have better motivation. Difficult to do with characters that did not give anything to start with. <br /> <br /> It is a bit delicious that the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we see from the sequence of. It is liquid; it will not flow on the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> The End Frost! - meaning only to appease political correctness. With its power source restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak force, needing codification. Parents of giant robots and sky cycles that make lightning blue indicate that what they fear is less than they might fear. This technology is superior to our technology, and certainly to the early twentieth century. In the end, Milo needs to teach the Atlanteans to read, why? The whole idea is to leave their chaste culture alone alone, not to send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lost World's plot, and the setting should give me the beginning of this century, hinting that this is a tribute to the heart. The failure I find in the film is consistent with this idea. But I am puzzled why I have to pay to see high figures and plot loopholes just because so many Daim novels have. The pulp stories are part of the "crap they can not sell adults anymore", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our son needs to grow up too. The Lost Ark did not lose any feeling of pulp and avoided much of the damage. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is fun, but I'm thinking about the plot, leaking constantly.
