I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not so much. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, has no real story, has bad actors, not funny and much more. Is this a movie you would like to see? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to be creative and creative, but it seems to be made by a 12-year-old boy without cinematic skills at all. The so-called ridiculous parts is as funny as with pancakes in people's faces, or breaking the wind. Of tact if this is the kind of humor you love, this is the right movie for you !! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
