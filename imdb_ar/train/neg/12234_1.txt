I think it's useless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good film, but it was absurd to produce a second part of a film in which one of the main characters died (Macaulay Culkin like Thomas J.). The story ended after the first film. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story go on. This was meaningless!
