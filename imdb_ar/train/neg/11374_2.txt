I could not relate to this film. Failed to engage me either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was intense and not involved. I could not communicate with any of the characters, so I find it difficult to find a lot of positive things to say about them. <br /> <br /> I have read this to understand correctly and one needs to know about some of the most ambiguous aspects of Catholic theology. I will admit that, as an atheist, I may not be familiar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues because my subjects are still universal to the human condition and do not rely on specialized knowledge or beliefs.
