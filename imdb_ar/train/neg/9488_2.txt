I have seen some horrible horror movies in my time, and although this is not the worst in the group, it is definitely in the lower half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to the hospital as an apprentice, hoping to fill him with a better job for him and his future wife. Hey cute? The film directs directly to the toilet when you realize that something is killing the sick. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that is reaping the lives of people. It is the task of one doctor, one nurse and a security guard in all the hospital staff to pull this mental patient down the basement, doing rituals that involve greatly cutting off the tongue, then letting the haunted house support the demon to come out and steal his soul through the charm of cheesy special effects. At this point the film becomes ridiculously stupid, I begged it to end. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half-hour "Tales from the Crypt" that somehow extended to a clown for an hour and a half. From Tiny Lister, who does his best to represent John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins, who plays the role of nurse Ratchet stereotypes, this film fails at every possible level. I was given this 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) His fianc√©e is very hot, the pain slightly relieved near the end and 2) the film looks really good, much better than the current trend of horror movies that are manufactured by high quality Walmart cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this feces even if you have a blockbuster pass (which I do, and I still feel cheated). As an additional drinking game, you and your friends take a bullet every time Matt Stacy (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You will be drunk within 15 minutes in the movie.
