The American pie went a long distance from the first. At first, I think the actors have no idea what they're doing, and instead, it's just a new edition of the college ceremony. The story of the story is that they are two young men in the college (including a young man) who define college entrance dreams only to experience late-night parties, sex and of course. The plot is stupid and comes away from the original pie. In fact they did not show back an apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent it for free. But please remember that it is a waste of time unless you enjoy mindless sex movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I think that even Ivan Almighty would be a better option instead.
