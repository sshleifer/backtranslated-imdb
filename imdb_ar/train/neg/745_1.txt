I'm not sure how to start describing how bad this film is. I love bad movies, because they are often more entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad representation, bad music, and incompetent direction. Except for the music (which was better than I expected), this film had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were surprisingly bad. Worst I've seen since Nintendo 64. Some of the sights to watch include Thunder Child, Woman's Crash Mechanical Foot, Big Ben Scenery, Wreck Train ... Wow, there are lots of bad effects! On the plus side, although some of the exotic infantry scenes were well done. <br /> <br /> The acting was as bad as it could have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells. To get such good source material, it seems as if the actors were trying to be too much to make it funny. Then there is the mustache ... the most fragmented piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains acting. The rest are characters walking around quietly and the effects of bad shots. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Heinz is an incompetent manager will be unfair to incompetent managers. Using different color filters between shots for no particular reason, using poorly rendered backgrounds even within scenes, the bad green screen, it's amazing to me how this guy got approval to direct a movie. I do not imagine it would be possible to turn a wonderful book into a bad film. Bravo, Mr. Heinz. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to watch this movie is to do what I did: You have some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, and continue to drink, and maybe will bring it all the way through. It's good for an excellent bad movie, so enjoy yourself and laugh at yourself with this disaster.
