To be as honest as possible, The Devil's Plaything (or the veil of blood or the euphoria or the curse of the black sisters or ????) is a full load. The film has a good premise behind it? Resurrection of a long vampire through the body of a scion by helping and helping a group of women dressed in black? But the execution is terrible. There are long and long moments of screen time when nothing literally happens. The characters just stand around with nothing to do. There is no mystery, no suspense, and there are no points of interest. Simply bad representation. Most acting involves a group of mediocre women looking to dance nude while staring at the camera. They do this again and again. And what a small plot that seems designed to get more women less attractive than women so they can join the dance. While it is not as bad or meaningless as dancing or plotting in something like Orgy of the Dead, it is approaching.
