First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this film, which is very bad. This film contains all the horror movement vulgar in the imagination, all played badly. Teen couple over sex. Comedy (No) Horny Jock. A cold mucus chick. The man's local color is creepy. Couple parents. The eldest chick that does not die amazingly in these films. The dialogue is extremely horrible and is delivered with the depth of the wading pool. It looks like you'd like to die all sooner. I've seen the hard part of this film for a while, but somehow, it's gotten worse. Surely the most extreme thing here is the Ghoul who tries to eat Jameson implants, but this hardly classifies even the rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
