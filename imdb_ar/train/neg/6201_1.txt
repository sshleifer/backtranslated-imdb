I have seen him. It's not a "good" but interesting way to reduce it. The boys are very natural but ................ The rape scene of the graphic / unwarranted gang is abhorrent - and yes - the arbitrary input in World War II footage is an attack the way it tries to compare horror The real hatred with this hatred of women. Real horror is real - this movie is just awful. However, the film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that this is the "new emperor clothes," but in fact the opposite direction. The film looks good, but the direction, the story, the content, and the final feeling it takes from this film is a vacuum. If the feeling can be empty, that is it.
