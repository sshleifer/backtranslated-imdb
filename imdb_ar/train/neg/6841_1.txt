I hear rumors about "Leonard Nimoy clarifying the Blu-ray Disc" next. With progress over the past 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see whether the franchise can be activated or not. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste that my mouth has left through that entire Magnavision demo. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy explains Betamax VCR" a milestone in the history of entertainment. After the demonstration "Leonard Nimoy clarifies the small cassette" and "The Harmful Right" Leonard Nimoy explains the 8-track tape, which was expecting such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm crying now just thinking about it.
