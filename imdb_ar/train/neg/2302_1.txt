Listen to some interesting things, our battle hero Pat Battle, his son Gordon (the television department looks like a family company) and Terry Mason (Miss America won in 1973 by wearing swimsuits and showing her legs.) Say when our poor viewers feel sick and need To help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with "right abscess tooth" has just been cured. A person has been cured with "twisted intestines." 3 Then Terry said that someone was suffering from a "strange state" (did he mean that God did not know?) A burn in his legs, and he had just been healed. With a swelling of the sinuses in his right cheek, with severe pain behind the right eye, but is now recovering. 5 A person with the right hip, limited mobility of the stroke, is now able to walk. 6. Terry said she saw someone with severe stiff neck bone, but she did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) - that the person has now healed. 7. A person with paralysis on the right side, especially (not exactly ?!) The right side of the face has now been cured. The man (who narrows the world's population again.) Faces a plate in his skull with persistent problems, and doctors do not know what to do. Terry said she saw the bone fit around the plate (the funny bone ?!) The man's pain had disappeared, and it was now healed. <br /> <br /> How to help our war hero become our sick and missing people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas but that narrows the road). Who has a pocket healed by the Lord is now dry Thank you, Jesus. 2. There is a man who has a financial need - I think one hundred thousand dollars (I think their God needs to go to school or anything!) This need has been met for the time being, and within three days, money will be provided through the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati who has lymphoma. <br /> <br /> I do not know if he has been diagnosed yet (Ask your god a vengeful!) But you were not so good, and the Mr. melts this cancer now! (What ?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I suppose Canada.) In the curve of a wheelchair in the spine, the Lord corrects what we have now, and you can stand and walk! (If you have this condition ignore Pat!) It's it for you. Thank you, Jesus! Amen Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson was diagnosed with prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popov, or Roberts' mouth, or Benny Henn? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a real doctor for his surgery! (Does he mean he does not trust his faith in treating his friends, Terry or his son Gordon ?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War, he was a liquor officer responsible for keeping the officers supplied with liquor. It was known that he drank himself and hated prostitutes and feared that he had contacted the grooms. (One of the healers must be asked for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason for Pat's coming out of combat is that his father Absalom and Willis Robertson (D Va was from 1946 to 1966 chairman of the Senate Military Appropriations Committee. > Terrorist attacks, September 11, 2001, Imagine ourselves at risk and were consumers by seeking health and wealth (Pats worth between 150 and 200 million people!) Physical pleasures (Palace in Virginia Beach Virginia with launch pad) (He had sex with his wife in the future before they had a son!) It is (terrorism) happens because God raises his protection from us ( September 13, 2001). Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermester in Santa Claus coming to Town and his evil God reminds me of Venger on Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> The spoiled Gordon does what his father tells him and Terry is a paid woman They have their own minds! <br /> <br /> This will take you! The September 5, 2005 edition of The 700 Club includes a report by the Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lynne from outside the New Orleans Convention Center, which included most of the victims of the poor black disasters Throughout the weekend. "There are a number of properties left behind that indicate the mentality of some of the evacuees," Lin said, "and they include this voodoo cup with the words" may be a curse with you. "A screenshot of a plastic cup was seen from an endless store In New Orleans on the screen. "Guinilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us." Lin said, pointing to a pile of CDs or rap music scattered on the floor. (His obsessive father Absalom has taught racism well) Good people are thinking of donating to these sexually intolerant people Please do not wish in the name of God to sponsor a team of basketball or basketball, or give a meal, and be a big brother or sister to a child, but please Do not give these people because they have been around for more than 40 years and have not solved anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, type Pat Robertson, which you heard during the commercial break on the web and click on the search, and once you hear what you really like, I know for sure that you will not give one cent to these deceived liars! By the way, Terry had been divorced once and had spoken against divorce several times in his programs. <br /> <br /> I would like to say a tribute to people in Dover Pennsylvania, Orlando Florida, and to the wonderful people who hit Hurricane Katrina and I hope it will be a fun day. Was the pool process useful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please inform our readers! I am doing! By the way, if you get sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars. Someday, Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger with them!
