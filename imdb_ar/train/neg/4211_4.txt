About 4 years ago, I loved this movie. I was watching him again and again. But now ... I do not. In fact, I think this movie was great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a group of famous commentators (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and a beautiful cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Colkin was riding his bicycle and he was caught in a gang and a member of the gang said: "Tyler, where are you going?" the moon? "Look also for the classic line," Do you have a feeling in your toes? "<br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than" good son ".
