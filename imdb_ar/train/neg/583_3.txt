I bought this amendment because I really liked Ann Bronte's novel when I read it some time ago and I usually enjoy the BBC series. But I was very disappointed. I never thought it would be as bad as this: the whole chain made me laugh more than just as animated as the novel did. <br /> <br /> First of all, the music (and the songs) seems totally absent from the drama period (sounds as if they were written for a contemporary horror film). Like another commentator, I was particularly disturbed by the way cameras circulate around Actors. I've seen some scenes filmed this way in North and South and everything looked fine there but in the Tenant, it's definitely overpriced and simply annoying. Camera movements can not make a wooden representation too lively. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to distinguish in most other roles at first and the text lacked clarity. None of the characters were initially displayed correctly. The little boy performed very well, it was very nice and the best movie in the film. <br /> <br /> Twells Fitzgerald's description of Helen Graham made her look cool and harsh, and did not let the emotion pass. She does not seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I could not believe that Markham had fallen for her and I do not recall her terrible hairstyle given to her. I could not feel some empathy with her husband! Fancy to be married to such a sailing woman ... Moreover, it was the only main actor who seemed right to me. Toby Stevens Well I found, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel dealing with dark topics such as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what is hinted only at the reader's imagination in the book and left behind is invoked in television adaptation: making some scenes horrific and comic, (such as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed) and others away from sex. Drama period! I mean, do not we get enough bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
