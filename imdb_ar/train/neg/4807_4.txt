"Ambush" is not a normal work flick. It's bad to be normal. A man walks toward the other with a machine gun. The other man shoots in one of the sessions and the man falls into the force of the larger fire without approaching him with bullets. Guess which one is a good guy. Doh. This is an "ambush" through and through. Not flicking good work, not good drama, not good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels because it takes a look at Veterans in film "B" mechanically through the movements as if they knew they were making a real loser. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
