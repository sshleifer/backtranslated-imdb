Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked at my little box Comcastic to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. The director says he has the following kind of worship in the description. Funny how do not warn me not to watch this movie. I could not use this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is like Troll 2 exactly because it was named entirely. It has little (if any, based on your point of view) related to the zombie, all within a single city. This film revolves around a quirky policeman, working as badly as possible (he should try to absorb it a lot), while women are arrested for trivial nonsense and then killed. Yes, he is a serial killer. This film is not only flawed in the belief that it is merely a zombie flick, it also errs in the serial killer's facts. Armed killers enjoy murder, live for it, and collapse with them. This man knocks women and injects them with some poison. He does not even have sex with the body or cut it. Talking about boring! In the end, one of the five women who killed them protected her voodoo. For whatever reason, the five returned to life and went to kill this man. They were all buried or thrown into the ocean, but you would not know he was buying the clean clothes they all wore. The women then behave very badly and their revenge. Hey Yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was nonsense in every category. Representing crap, writing crap, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. Women do not look like zombies, unless you rely on the dark make-up around the eyes to be the actual definition of what makes the zombie. They can all speak, act, think and act in a full human way. Gossip is weak compared to many PG-13 films and nudity surpasses existence. You see a glimpse of the breasts in the opening sequence ... then the same two breasts exactly later! Go and conclude. Guess only one actress was willing to go naked for this vulgar. The police station was created so badly that you could see where they had stopped painting the walls of the depot that they were clearly filming. You can see pipes, poor lighting, very sparse setup and even, unless you are blind, you can see the manager's failure. Clear guidance, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
