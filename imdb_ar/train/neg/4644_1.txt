This terrible film relates to the story of a woman trying to discover what happened to her sister. The film struggles with his identity, flowing from Noir's excitement to erotic, with horror elements thrown into good measure. The film has a very confusing structure, for example with repeated use to go back without linking it to stories. The plot was poorly developed, making the characterization difficult to distinguish between who was and who was playing. There are some clashes in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist accompanies a strange stranger to his home, then agrees to go upstairs only (to where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun she brought with her, to call the police, Extremely believable. Some movies are very bad: we were watching a 42-inch TV, so how could anyone with a smaller group know what was happening in the scenes that were taken in total darkness almost a surplus.
