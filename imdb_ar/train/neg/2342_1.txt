I do not know what would be great in this film. Worse yet, why should anyone bother seeing this one? First of all, there is no story. One can say that even without a story the movie could be worth watching because it evokes some kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion this film does not do that too. <br /> <br /> You only see images for +/- two hours. There are more useful things you can do. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the film is an experience and it is bold because it lacks all of the above. But is it worth two hours of precious time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is no.
