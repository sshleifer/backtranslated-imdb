First, let me say I am a big believer in Fanpro stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show after a long time of canceling it. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So, I have a suitable place for fanpro stuff and that means I will overlook the things I usually choose badly. <br /> <br /> Thus, go to ST: HF. Well, first off the good stuff. Enthusiasm is a big part of making any offer believable, and for the most part, it seems that the crew of different ships is spending a good time in their roles. After that, the effects are not bad for home effort, with nothing to make you really sneeze. The stories are not too bad either. There is nothing particularly innovative, but it is strong enough, and at least there are continuous arcs of stories. <br /> <br /> But it has a lot of disadvantages. <br /> <br /> First, although it is clear that they have to break the Star Trek screenshots, and put backgrounds, music, and effects, I see no reason to begin virtually virtually any other scientific musical results at all. Everything from aliens to the forces of the spacecraft raises the head of the orchestra at one time or another. Similarly, many of the footage taken from other films, were broadcast on CGI from each other to make them look different. Gray warships, for example, though disguised, are obviously devastating Star of Star Wars. The station is also fairly clear Fleet Battler Station Ticonderoga of the stars forces. Similarly, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, as well as animations on footage. In one scene either in the first or second season, I think, until you see two TIE fighters fly past during a battle, which hardly makes your comment to disbelieve any preferences. <br /> <br /> Representation varies from reasonable to extremely painful to watch. Everyone gets better with the progress of classes, but is expected to accumulate on the screen a lot, especially in the early classes. They have also made some exciting acting choices. Let's just say that the food replication tools in this show are always set on the "cake" and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are generally effective. But they must actually mercilessly commit to death the person who decided to use Ferengi and Cardassian masks cheap for anything other than the use of background or "passer-by" shots. They are beyond realism. Every time I saw one of these things (apart from trying not to laugh too much) I kept expecting to wear this unfortunate soul to pull out a weapon and declare that "this is a stick!" In one scene, Kardasian actually speaks while wearing one of these things. Not only does the lips not move, but the mask does not even contain an opening that must have the mouth. Someone needs to slap it so hard. Craft knife can not be taken for it, for good! There are also some amazing but unintentional make-up functions, such as Herman Munster look similar. <br /> <br /> Writing, though coherent, is not new. Instead, the script runs like the continuation of the DS9, with the ships coming out of the DS12 in different tasks. The new enemy, the "gray", is not significantly threatened, and its plot line is actually reworking Burg's strings. For example, Starfleet meets Gray, and Gray is very strong, Starfleet barely escapes their lives, then begins by finding technology in ways to fight the enemy and so on. The crux of the dispute is dialogue. Star Trek has long been able to write "insert technobabble here" in a script. This usually means displaying the latest plan to fight the enemy using "quantum phase features" or "isolated charges" and so forth. In other words, this nonsense tells you that they are on the case and that there is a decision at hand. <br /> <br /> The words are just really jargon. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF raises a mess, it contains comments from the real world in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "we need to regroup" looks good, but not when it is pronounced with three characters already in a group. Similarly when asked what was the situation, a tactical officer heard a response: "We count three battleships." Does he really need to count them? Come on! I was expecting the liquid to ask him "Are you sure?" Or "You can double check". But my favorite comment at all is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we make a two-way connection?" <br /> <br /> Comms officer: "No, we can not send and receive only .." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all of the above, the offer improves as it progresses. Bad chapters 1 and 2 are very bad, 3 shows improvement but 4 and 5 are where they start to improve markedly. Season 6 seems reasonable so far. <br /> <br /> I'm having trouble choosing media for these shows. Quicktime sucks, quite frankly, and the more you move to the divx / avi format the better. Some of us like to take our already downloaded programs and watch them on a screen of a suitable size and not a peer in a small QT window on your computer screen. Quicktime does not only make this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution in which the shows appear does not expand at all. In fact, it makes the presentations largely unmatched, as if they were a copy of the X-VHS tape. The least they can do is include a downloadable hi-res option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the program has a promise, and I even like some characters. But there are 40 episodes running, so I'm not sure this illustrates much about personal development at all. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> Note: out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this offer as 9 or 10. Hmmmm .. Were we watching the same show? Or are you 19 years old?
