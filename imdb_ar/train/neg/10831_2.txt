I think this director / writer has something to say. Let's see, what could it be ... Would the frog storms be scary? B. Can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the word "C" several times and it looks like Patrick Rafter is bad? C. My wife casts her and asks her to say the word "F" every two seconds. This aside I really liked the start and the storm of the frog. The rest was a relentless failure, too long (without modification), and a tolerant failure. Happy many of you enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
