It was good luck to see this film in a show in the United States. After I sat reluctantly all bad, I was shocked because I saw a lot of good ratings here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original film was Turkey, but it was interesting. I absorbed it in the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this movie stinks of ......., well, nothing really. It's bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a bad ad for perfume - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna has never been able to act, and has been embarrassing on the big screen for years. It looks worse and worse than every year of those years, as it grows more like dark-skinned machines. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" for "Luke Stock", was also unable to make films - his films are shallow, bad parts, fashion shows. He is not disappointed here; he wisely portrayed his wife as a star of this disaster. <br /> <br /> I ask people, pay careful attention to the good reviews this film has received from other posters below. Obviously they are business facilities. <br /> <br /> Richie is not encouraged to insult himself more by giving him money. <br /> <br />
