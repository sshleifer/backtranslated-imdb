Why did any legitimate actor participate after reading the script in this strange book? Oh my God it's really embarrassing watching him. I can not imagine the shame that these people should feel for being part of it. Also, there seems to be some controversy over whether the Phoenix River has a veil in the film. It was not approved, but its own role list here (IMDB) gives it credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister to those who were asking before. This movie is proof that no matter how many "names" you have. Transplant ears do not make silk purses. I loved Lauren Bracco, but this was just sad, sad, sad ... maybe someone could explain to me why this kind of movies. It has no granular, amusing, or even comic features as compared to it's all bad else.
