Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Jimon Honsu. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) is walking around in this film as zombie <br /> <br /> Beyonce ?? Was acting ?? <br /> <br /> This film is dwarfed by Chicago or any other modern music. <br /> <br /> If it was not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would have given this ZERO. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the play so I do not try a typical Broadway versus Hollywood rap.
