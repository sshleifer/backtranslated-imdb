I realized that the US military was frustrated in 1971, but this film was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp and not a punishment battalion in the SS in Sven Hassel's novel. The writer must be a real fan of the army. The psychological sergeant who continued to beat the crap belonged to the people in the prison cell, and the top sergeant should have been dismissed useless. These men were going abroad, and the receiving units were certainly wondering where all the defective recruits came from, which would be followed by an investigation. The scene that blew him up was the electric shock scene. Farrell, the alleged lawyer for the barracks, would have asked the trainer to outlaw his release (to torture prisoners of war contrary to the Geneva Convention), the actual assault on a registered man, sexual abuse and the conduct of an improper officer. Intead he walks away. After that, discipline to the level of madness and film becomes inaccessible. I do not know how ended, I went to bed.
