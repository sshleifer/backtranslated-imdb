Eight academic nominations? It is beyond belief. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even according to Hollywood standards. With Huston as director, Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as listers, maybe you've swallowed the bait and seen it anyway, but Oscar nominations have already sold me, and I feel cheated as a result. <br /> <br /> So, it's a black comedy? Can anyone tell me where the humor is in the Prizzi Award? It is certainly not tasteless (shooting at the wife's wife's head is only a supposed comic term in this farce intended for the life of the mafia) but with the exception of a joke about "my favorite Mexican cigar" (which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who were officially banned from buying any Something Cuban over the past 50 years) has failed to discover anything of a comic nature - and I have tried. There are lots of clich√©s in the Mafia but Clichy does not constitute a teaser in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a romantic comedy of some kind? Start. The characters and their relationships are absolutely incredible and so shallow that they are on par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it a cleverly crafted parody about the Mafia? Not in millions of years. The plot is just useless futility and is not ridiculous comic, and usually has a feeling of a really bad (and cheap) mafia movie. It seems like a tribute rather than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and a little humor written for them, the actors are left dangling and elongating. Well, that's not enough; even when the face is pulled by the comic face expression master, Jack Nicholson (repeat with a swollen upper lip ... now does that mean to be a parody of Brando's stuffed gems in the movie The Godfather? ... Oh! ? ... All I know is, it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw in a slow slow direction (this movie continues for two hours), and some deadly dialogue is desperate and verbal like. "You remember Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll follow you wherever you go," and a lot of vulgar behaviors will come to this fast forward button before you can say "capiche?". The Prizzi's Honor is far from being a "masterpiece" in Huston and is rather hard work. It is certainly one work in the law of the great director who must be given a tangible coat and thrown in the Hudson River.
