*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, and I really do it, and he does his best through an incredible role. I can see how this film may sound as good as a scenario, but it is wrapped and unlikely and ultimately ridiculous. I saw the fake death ends a mile away. Rene Zed is trying hard with a written part, as is Patricia Arquette. The investigator whose name I can not remember (this is not Chris Ben) is sweaty. You can watch it if you are not smart enough to distinguish between being very smart and you can not follow it, and it is confusing that you can not understand it. You can see it if you like the amazing camera work that makes you feel dizzy. See if you like watching Tim Roth working with impractical text. See if it comes late at night for free. Otherwise, hire the usual suspects.
