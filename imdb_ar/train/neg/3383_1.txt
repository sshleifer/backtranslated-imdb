I first saw live music at the Denver Performing Arts Center and it was amazing and amazing, and it has a wonderful continuity of story and dialogue to the extent that I liked it much more than most of the musicals I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you never saw Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was strong and directed the entire production direction. When I heard that they were making a film of it, I waited for my breath, but when I saw the movie version I was so disappointed that I felt like I was cheated. The film lacks an attractive mood in direct production and never allows you to be in close contact with each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if that should be revived, I warmly recommend that you go away to see it. It will be one of the most enjoyable experiences you'll enjoy.
