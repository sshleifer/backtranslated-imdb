HAH! So this is the movie that "Next Motion Stars" were entering. Well, I'm glad I did not share and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how one can only look at the first 10 seconds (!) And think about it. About the film? I mean Come! Just look at these headlines !? I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for television and we could not afford to watch it all). One evening while I was in the military service the audience with me was the usual dodgy average men who once watched a series like Las Vegas Only for girls in the show. So the tape was not too loud, and the most watched movies in my collection were Girl Next Door (and it was not because of the big scenario; D. But the total lack of this film to originality, acting, programming and almost everything else made the film very easy to switch the channel to Las Vegas It's a CSI (do not remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group ... this is rare (!) For the heavens "not through this movie! If on TV, then yes, Because Joel Silver has already produced some of the best motion pictures there (Die Hard, Matrix 1), I can only say that They do not give the film quality, they give money to the directors, and sell this movie just because it's a movie that Silverwell is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws the crew has really made.
