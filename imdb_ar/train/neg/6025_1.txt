"Left Behind" is the movie "We Know What We Know because We Know It" (a film that Christians (mostly naive people) need to help them feel as if they "think" and "believe" (not "know") right. But, at the same time, I feel bad for the kids, because this film is not good. Does not help any message. I work in a video store, and I know that the only reason people went to watch this movie is that they were religious and thought it was. Anyone on this land who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know they do not know. I have enough (but only after I got a lot) from these people who walk with their noses in the air believing that the films starring a semi-talented television actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away. I have refused to go into any details about this film (not because AI did not see it (because I did), B - it was very hard to deal with an atheist (because it was not), or CI really do not have anything you say bad (because I do) "I want to get this film out of my head, and I want it to be made of my head, I want to see all that with an opening from my head, I want the message that Kirk gave with pride and a coach at the end The film from my head, I just want all the things that were in my head before watching these movies there, anything connected directly to this film floats in my mind! Because someone in this world went to the theater to watch this movie about what could happen in the future (but it would not) when they could give Seven Dollars Plus to any number of human or animal charities or Rain Forest, but if they did So they will not be able to "believe" in the fact that it is real, they may be forced to the reality of what is left behind zero (outside ****)
