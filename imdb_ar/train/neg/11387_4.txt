Medellin is a great place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitary groups taking tourists hostage, or anything like that. There are "invisible police", but they are not * Big Brother system. There is not enough police to be visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without good reasons. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary film where the young people portrayed in the film are mainly characters. The filmmakers carefully dig lines of plot between the daily work of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when "Personality" dies, there are real novels. However, it is hard to imagine that all three young men were members of the Metro Block, a gang that had been terrorizing Sierra Leone before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> No Sierra is not an accurate portrayal of life in Colombia; of course, there are things to be wary of like simple crime, but when one thinks of picking up in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Looks different this way. Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that the war-torn country is now booming more than ever before.
