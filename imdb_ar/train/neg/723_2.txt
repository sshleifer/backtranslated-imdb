I did not get this movie ... Was he a musician? No ... but there were songs designed and dancing in it ... <br /> <br /> Was it a serious drama .... The acting was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a serious and good actor .. Certainly not. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to stay awake through this separate movie. The letter of apartheid is referred to as "honoring" the students who died during the student uprising. But since the entertainment was so bad and the documentary film was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but I hate him fairly.
