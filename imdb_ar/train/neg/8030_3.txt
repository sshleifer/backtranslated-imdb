Not too keen on this really. The story is very scary and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, the nuns' bill was good. After that it was very scary. Tim does not fit the role, it happens that the arrogant and magnifying ass and Pruitt taylor vince is not completely convincing as a trumpet player. It's a perfect movie and as a musician, I feel a little insulted after watching it. There are no scenes from 1900 playing or playing with his teammates, he is completely tolerant of himself. I find it difficult to build any relationship with this kind of characters, maybe I'm watching the wrong film. If you do not have any real passion for life or in the sense of all the music around it, enjoy the good luck in suspending disbelief and watching this nonsense.
