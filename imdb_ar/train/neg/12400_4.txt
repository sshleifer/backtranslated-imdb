Matt Cordell came back from the dead in the third round, although I'm not sure that anyone interested at this stage except the fans of the Manica COP team paramedics. Cordele, who died in the last flick, was revived through the voodoo, and is now on the trail of many villains involved in the shooting of fellow officer Cordele is very fond of. I missed part of this low-budget, low-budget game in the early 1990s, but I was pleased to see Cordell shock the number of bodies in different and ugly ways. The problem is that the gross film is fairly constant, not Cordell simply Jason or Freddie. The attention quickly disappears, even with the great teacher in B-Robert Robert Forster as a doctor ends up in his brains. Commit to the first film in the series, which is funny, scary and exciting, all at the same time.
