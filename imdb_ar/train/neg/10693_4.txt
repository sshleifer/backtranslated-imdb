Maybe dubbing, or perhaps endless scenes for people who cry or grumble or continue to do so, but I found that Europa '51 is one of the most gruesome (and so disturbing) movies I have ever seen. The film begins consciously if it is familiar, because my mother Ingrid Bergman is very busy spending time with her spoiled son (Sandro Francina). While the mummy and the father (Alexander Knox) ​​enjoy their guests at a gala dinner, the young man tries to kill himself and begins a series of life-changing events that find Bergman spending time bathing in compassion for the poor and the needy. Driven by the editor of the communist newspaper Andrea (Itur Giannini), she spends more time with the oppressed than she does with her husband, who quickly locked her in a madhouse because of her problems. Bergman plays the role of the saint to the fullest extent, echoing her role in 1948 as Jean Arc, and Rosellini does a great job of lighting and filming for best effect. Unfortunately, the script connects his point of view with the accuracy of the hidden fist, as Andrea alternates with Mom announcing Marxist and Christian statements. In the last scene filled with tears, I had more than fill these tired characters. A real step down to Rossellini was because he moved away from the new realism and embraced the mythological and mystical themes of the 1950s of St. Francis' Flowers.
