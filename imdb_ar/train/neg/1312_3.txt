Tom listens to an old radio program, seen by children from the 1950s to the present day on television. However, they did not play television when the cartoons were made so that people get entertained - from comedy to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shakes his shoes as he listens to a story about "Phantom". He actually does everything the narrator says, such as "the hair is standing on the end, cold chills racing her spine, beating her heart in her throat", etc. Jerry, at the same time, watches Tom and laughs his butt on his fear - the alien cat. <br /> <br /> Then we will taste what we will see for many years after these 194 cartoons in which Jerry tortured Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks about trouble, that's one thing, but when he thinks about his own work and Jerry physically ill-treats him (and in this case, mentally), I find it hard to root the "little guy". <br /> <br /> These early T & M efforts were slightly longer than that. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. I did here because this was actually dragged for a while. It could have been cut to five minutes without losing anything because the graphics lasted for a long time. This is usual for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are much faster.
