Once again, Disney managed to produce a children's film that completely ignores his background. About the only thing common with this graphic and the original tool are the names. The most obvious errors are the characters - Penny does not contain her book, Brain has been reduced from character to fictional prop, Dr. Claw is more than just a wicked villain, etc. But there are more. The atrocities start from the first minutes of the film - the presence of the tool as a security guard, called John Brown, does not help identify it as the classic inspector. At first, we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn every story into a love affair between a man and a woman - presenting Brenda, who only works to make this film compatible with Disney. Add to this the fact that "Claw" seen in this classic film and Dr. Claw meet almost diagonally and you'll see that this will not be anywhere near the original story. What would be a better story to replace - but as you thought, Disney failed in that too. The whole film is just a silly acting tool for absurdity and lust after Brenda. As if adding insult to injury, Disney introduced the new "gadgetmobile" - it does not look, work or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just a basic "comic relief" character. It is clear that Disney realized that Gadjet's drawings were comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the smart fuzzy gags (such as the mission paper exploding in the face of the president) and replaced them with a gadget gadget being a fool, Gadgetmobile being a wise ass, "Showing off. A Disney person must tell that "Children's Film" does not mean "total lack of any use of the brain". The tool must target children between the ages of 10 and 12 ... and not children of 10 to 12 months old like this movie. Whatever the film is supposed to be, it is not, repeat NOT, the real inspector tool. Because I like the old tool, I hate this.
