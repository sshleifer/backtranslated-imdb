What a boob in the MGM think it would be a good idea to put Clark Gable in the role of a worker in the Salvation Army? Paradoxically, a future star, Cary Grant, played the role of a young Salvation Army boy just two years later in the highly acclaimed SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I think it's easy to see the folly of these roles, but I still wonder who the SAA men are "hot" and can look at these shattered men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. For a long time, I was working for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (US volunteers) and I did not see any men working there (which, unfortunately, included me). Maybe I should have gotten a job in the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So, for the most curious, it's a good movie to look for, but for others, it's a lousy book, dirty dialogue, and making morality annoying for a very slow film.
