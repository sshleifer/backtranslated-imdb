This movie is chaotic. I am surprised that it contains a theatrical version. Without Robin Williams, it was possible to go directly to the video. It is poorly written. It is badly directed. The worst thing is that he took an interesting subject and cut it into a ridiculous film full of suspense, suspense, and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half of the film turns into a series of ridiculous pieces, it ended up so that the audience that I saw was laughing at him. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is not suspicious and there is no excitement - in fact the worst crime in the film is that it is simply boring.
