Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this is still one of the worst films ever made. Bruce Lee died as a result of falling from a helicopter after being hit by a ninja knife at the back of the neck, but he does not explain how he became on a helicopter since the previous scene had approached him but not on the plane that is already 200 feet in the air. It's become quite ridiculous since then, like something from a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea was not very corrupt, but it was not done in any artistic sense from the point of view of filmmaking. There are dozens of martial arts launchers out there, usually all manufactured in Hong Kong. I think Jean-Claude Van Damme has improved this genre by adding reasonable stories in his films and filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are far better than 90 percent of the unwanted martial arts films produced during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. Game of Death II falls into the category of unwanted film in my opinion, although Bruce Lee was in it.
