Being a great fan of Kurman horror movies I was expecting it from his Westerners a bit more than I got. Well, I've never been all right. I laughed a lot of laughter like watching a firearm from Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Watch the moving-tire scene on the Old West Lawn. You can kill time by counting them if there is a boring sight otherwise. The horses seem to have gears in them as well, and they are considered quick pursuits forward. See also the swaying bar-room queens in the traditional Wild West Salon, a number reminiscent of a modern 1920s dance, decades before the invention of elegance. I hope that the salon around them will not collapse. <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this chaos, major actors are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really good. We pay tribute to them for doing their best through materials that seem to have mostly been recovered from "Johnny Guitar", but they do not excite admiration the same way. But there is nothing really wrong for the funny West like this. Just like the bad old horror movie, it may fail in one direction but succeed in making it happy anyway. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work is my appeal and that is why I would suggest that you try this film if you have the opportunity.
