I watched the unclassified version of this film and realized that in about 30 minutes I never recovered my time. I went to the end in the hope that the dialogue would improve, that the martial arts would eventually look realistic, and the FX market would look special. I was very wrong. I love horror, I am a complete hound. I am a number of 1980s splitting among the great film world. But this was not made in the 1980s. If this movie was released in the early 1980s, the fax could be forgiven to look very bad. Not so, did not get this defense. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that I win in writing instead of pressing torture. I did not like Hostel, I never did, I thought he was overrated, I was not worried about him and I did not feel anything for the heroes, but he shines like a beacon to the greatness next to this garbage. Promise the back of the cover for the Live Feed twisting you will never see coming, I'm still waiting for the promised change.
