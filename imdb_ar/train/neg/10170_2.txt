The tournament is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not as good as they should be. From players with marital problems to taking overdoses of drugs to gambling problems to the killer, life hinders what must be a wonderful and unforgettable time. Can you put things back in place and stop the killer before you destroy the big game? <br /> <br /> Despite what you may think when you first read about the Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a piece of land and post-thinking. Instead, Superdome is one of the lousy soap opera films made in the 1970s that were made in Hollywood and never became movies. The actors are asleep on their way through the thing with no really looking good person. The best example (or worse) is Johnson's role in a very small role that seems generally lost because of why he is there. The plot is boring, interesting and incredible. Donna Mills as a "man" hit? Yes correct! It is a question of ratification as far as the issue of liquor is concerned. The film also lacks any speed. Try to get four or five story lines in a movie zaps no matter what the Superdome Flow may be. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very bad example of a TV-made movie in the 1970s. The most striking feature for me was the vocal work of the late Charlie Jones - a gymnast who lacked to listen to him. The eloquent and exaggerated way in New Orleans is fresh cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most others who have seen the Superdome, I have also done a complimentary Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the public access rings to KTMA, but it is one of the best examples of early start shows. Although I have rated the Superdome only 2/10, I will only give this generous 3/5 episode on my MST3K rating scale.
