A weaker entry into the Drummond Bulldog series, with John Howard in this role. The usual joke and strange funny, but not much of the plot. Barrymore gets what the inspector does, disguised to follow Drummond, Allegi and Tiny in a wild goose chase (most of them in circles; perhaps the budget is more extreme than usual) to save the poor Phyllis, who are being held by people who want to change his drum drum. For those who maintain the result, at this stage, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry her and that Algy is concerned about the loss of the baptism of the child. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed as a hunter to mingle with The Angler's Rest, but few of them rise above ridiculous.
