Williamson's tone is difficult to go into. Speaks amazingly fast, as he is in a hurry to get to the lines. Acting during solilquies as if talking to someone, when supposed to speak to himself. All this and a bald spot for him just annoyed me. He was very old for this role. In reading other novels about Williamson, he may have won this role because he was insane and the director decided to do some counterfeit works of life or forced representation. When the Hamlet actors declare mad they believe it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and can fail in the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The group is dark and vibrant but looks like it is trapped in a real castle especially the scenes in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
