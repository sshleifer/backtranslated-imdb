The end of the world looks like a good film on the cover of the box but warned it to be bad. He is a great admirer of the great actor Christopher Lee and has been my fool. Such as claws (77) does not mean the good actor that it will be a good film. The beginning looks promising, then turns into boredom, so many parts of the film are too dark to see what happens. The rest of the actors are briefly represented such as: Lou Ayers, Dean Jagger, and McDonald Carey as security guards. I expect better than the Charles Ensemble, which made interesting films such as animation and puppets. I heard that Christopher Lee had been deceived in making this film. His stars told the participants that Jos√© Ferrer, John Cardin, and Jagger.well Dean Jagger are there but the other two have never been lucky if I make a film about the end of the world using a larger budget and better storyline.dean Jagger continued to do two good films afterwards; (80) The Death Game (79) Sue Leon (Lolita) is another in the film minus her lollipop. If you are guilty of punishment then watch the end of the penalty world that I dare to say awake through the entire film.
