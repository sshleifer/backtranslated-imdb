What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste too much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to recover the few hours you lost. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it - I do not have any actor or singer. He is completely without talent in both majors. It is shameful that many talented people are lost in community theaters and karaoke bars while hard-working as a basketball player is used to get undervalued actors in movies and CDs. The film was a pathetic talent that is Shaq.
