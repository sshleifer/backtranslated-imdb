It is a bit odd that the story is being placed in a part of Oslo where there is a very high proportion of the local population of an Asian background that does not show an Asian person or Africa, not even as an extra. This fact may describe Norwegian ethnic relations in general. - However. <br /> <br /> There are no spoilers - just a brief description: <br /> <br /> Friends depict four young people living in a flat lot in Oslo. The protagonist is two young men who do not succeed in directing their lives in any serious way. One might say that the film can be about the crucial and avoid responsibility - a kind of fear of growth. Plays narration on typical fantasies and fantasies in teen role models and lifestyle. Absolutely cliches. Although the story is rather funny, acting is good, and as a young man, one can match the attitudes of "crazy" personalities and complex love affairs, but I do not find the story or the characters believable. To polished and lacks depth. This movie uses the whole classy classic audience to make an entertaining movie with the same intellectual depth as "friends" (yes this appears on TV). <br /> <br /> Did the Norwegian film finally find its identity?: A popular audience in the American style. <br /> <br /> How about watching Tillsammans from Lukas Moodysson (together).
