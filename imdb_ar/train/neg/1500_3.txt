Oh, that's very bad, it's funny. The only way one can interpret such a thing is a pornographic party containing drugs that produced a movie just for fun. I mean: You can see pornographic actresses naked, having sex, then killed by human mutants. There are a lot of loopholes, including the classic "There is something wrong with it, oh no, it's half the person you used to be" and accidental killing caused by panic. But you can also find funny things like the intestines that are pulled through someone's ass and a man running through the forest, and then find himself beheaded by a wire tied between two trees (making a metallic noises later, as in the cartoons). In some way there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what is inside the actress, just the genitals are not enough. Thus, you will be able to see a lot of autopsies on dead bimbos. There is no dialogue. Gina and Chase have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Greco wanted when accepting a role here. I think this is a movie one has to watch with a fast forward button and just watch exciting stuff, just to remember the old C horror movies.
