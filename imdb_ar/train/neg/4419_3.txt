As an "underachieved Catholic," I spent 11 years in Catholic school but did not go to Mass for 35 years except for weddings and funerals. I thought I would get a kick from this. And I did. . . For the first two thirds of the film. They were all standard things - rigid school teachings, stifled sexual activity, etc. But then, suddenly, the film turned into meaning. Really mean. Now a blocker of yours, I've seen this before scandals reach the sexual exploitation of children. . . And perhaps I did not feel insulted by such abhorrent hateful excavations in the Catholic Church if I knew about these atrocities (such as the Catholic term!) And cover. <br /> <br /> It's been a few years since I hired the video, and I will not go back to renting it again with a new perspective. I have left this dirty, dirty and ugly taste in my mouth. . . I wonder what experience all the actors have experienced with the Church, because they either really dislike it, or wonder about their salary. It is an incredibly anti-Catholic film, offensive to anyone with a glimmer of respect for Catholic teaching. I still do because there were no better teachers in the fifties. Whatever the nuns did, they forced me to learn how to read and write English. They made us save. (How many children today can make a simple calculation in their heads?) The truth is, there is nothing more important to success in America. Can you read? Can you add / subtract / multiply / divide? Great. You can get any advanced degree you want. Your Catholic education system will stand in good shape not only with continuing your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic "legends" that we all had to learn. <br /> <br /> Such a wonderful cast, such a rotten bad line. I really feel bad (no, it's not "bad" - trust me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project must be among the bad kids who sat in the back of the room if they wanted to make the film.
