Adaptation of plays in cinema is often a bad idea because there are two different ways. Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU in a play? Imagine that when two of the brave red coats sit in a tent gurgling "Blimey there are thousands of them there" a wonderful movie and a bad theater scene <br /> <br /> For theatrical play to make brilliant cinema a basic need <br /> 1 ) A wonderful collection that will create on the chemistry of the screen <br /> <br /> 2) A wonderful dialogue <br /> <br /> On paper, Cher and Chazz Palminterri will be a good choice to meet but not in these roles. The story revolves around a successful man playing with the mantra as he storms into a house to kill a wife singing and singing most of the events inside the house. I could not take these two people seriously though it was probably a script error that could not determine whether it was trying to be serious or funny. Because the story is very consistent, it is important that the dialogue be lit up and again because of the strange tone of the script, it is more embarrassing than anything else with much of the conversation about sex. If you want to see a wonderful translation of a theater that was transferred to the silver screen, give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead
