The idea of ​​the story behind the lost film is not bad at all, but unfortunately, the story seems a bit boring towards the middle and the excessive use of stock footage as well as bad special effects submerge this film to the sub-level. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a missile heading towards the ground. In a state of panic because it is about to hit the ground, the Soviets can distort the object. This is not necessarily good, since this unmanned drone has a steam path that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each passing pass, follow a series of death - one that can kill us all !! So it's up to the good American scientists (led by Robert Loggia at a very early age to be identified) to formulate and plan to save us - especially saving New York City on its way! Unfortunately, they are unable to save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I can not say whether this is a big loss or not) but thanks to the good old American knowledge, they can finally destroy this harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​the story is not bad and not rather. However, many of the older sections of fighter jets and men who manage the radar ranges have become a bit old and it seems like a charge. In general, a respectable but barely inspired film by fans of this type of film - all others, see it at your own risk.
