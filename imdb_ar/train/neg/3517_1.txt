I do not know who wrote the script for this film, but from the very first moment, I felt angry. Of all the possible decisions they can make in the mountains, why make the decision, which is the most dangerous? Why do criminals behave stupid, even though they managed to get a huge sum from the bank and stay away from it? Why not land the main criminal plane, shoot Stallone, seize the money and fly with the chick as a hostage? There are more cases of illogical behavior. I will give this 5-point film to do great work and wonderful landscapes, but because of the irrational behavior of the characters, I can only give this movie one point ...
