Sorry, this film did not scare me but it bothered me. It was very frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all this, fell on the side of the road. children! the father! Obsession! It was so much potential and animal! Zero, Nada! I've heard all this before. Scary! No! I can frighten myself on my own, here where I sit, more than in the film. Are there men who write this figure that women should be very annoying? Hey? This film was completely atmospheric. Or at least could have been, if the director / writer had bothered him. Maybe we had some good music that would have increased tension too, if someone made that effort. What I really want to know is why they get the money? Just give it to me and save all this trouble. abandoned? ... not where we betray
