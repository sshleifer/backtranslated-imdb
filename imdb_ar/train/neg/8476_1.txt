This movie was a terrible excuse for ... movie. First of all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn looked like the main character nothing like her TV mom. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot was satisfactory. Cliches were very predictable. The finish was very disappointing and cheesy. (But that's all I'll say about it). <br /> <br /> However, the nail in the bag was a scene in which Jordan hinson was supposed to cry, but the girl could not cry for it! There were no tears flowing on her face, just a few incredible sighs. It is not a dynamic representation at all. She gave the same little laugh that resembles the Hellaric laugh on Lizi Maguire (sp?). thats when the movie went from not good, to just bad. It really looks like they were acting. <br /> <br /> In short: this movie was really bad! It has been a kind of mix of all children's cliche films since the 1990s, fed up with everyone - even worse! <br /> <br /> I give her the movie "F" because it was very hard to sit (B / T / W, I was a kindergarten when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you may wish to do so if you have 9 or less. ;)
