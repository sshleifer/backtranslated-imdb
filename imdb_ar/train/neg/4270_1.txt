This is another incredible and insensitive piece of Hollywood Drake. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a work suit, convinces me that he was a second best cop. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is completely predictable and silly. Madeleine Stowe is the same as usual cardboard, and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this absurdity is quite predictable all the way to the end when Kurt Clotte Ray wears a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeleine then embrace the end of the mandatory film, and everyone - except Russell and Stu - will return to Utah to the back and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> Of course, Russell has done his exercises 10 times using 9mm, which is not necessary. This film can end with a stunning scene --- except for Hollywood, which talks about unnecessary violence, and the more it can add, or "enhance," the more their wounds.
