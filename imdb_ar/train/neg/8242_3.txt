After just watching five across the eyes, I must be honest ... I did not like it. I've read a lot of good reviews about this film, but I did not get the source of these comments. <br /> <br /> I've had a lot of time for new filmmakers, and I'm sure the directors will work well for themselves , But the budget they had was the main problem, there were two cameras used in the entire film (it was good) but they seemed like very cheap cameras. There was another problem: the voice, all these girls screaming and screaming at the same time, all talking about each other - it's impossible to just hear what they say. <br /> <br /> A good idea is that, in short, they hit a parked car and then stopped the car. Soon they were chasing her with the car they were beating, driven by a crazy woman who wanted to kill them and had many chances of doing so! ... On the other hand, girls have many opportunities to escape, but no! <br /> <br /> Too frustrating ... I just scraped this!
