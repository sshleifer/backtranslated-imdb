The film uses a recent title for a lame story. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The film includes scenes of taboos to make the viewer move again on his seats. The scenes are unnecessary and volatile. The movie is something that the novice screenwriter brought up. Just a waste of props movies and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it does not deserve 10 lines of my time, but I have to press to tell people to avoid nonsense. If people depend on you to pick a good movie for the night of the film, choose something else. If you have a spirit do not harm him by exposing yourself to this filth.
