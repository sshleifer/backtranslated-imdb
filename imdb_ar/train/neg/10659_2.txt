Cinematography: Excellent and brilliant camera angles (I can not remember seeing a movie recently, with good close-ups, even this film). Can avoid hideous scenes with a soft camera. New York is a good picture. I loved the corners upside down, especially (a different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. Do not spin songs in your mind even after watching the movie. May be, I was expecting the same quality as "Anian". Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal needs to slowly withdraw from the sequence of solid events. His age and his belly really show. Also, he must avoid the close romantic sequence go ahead. It was very embarrassing to see a mature / old star still trying to play like 20 + scenes of heroes. Love can be expressed at any age. As we age, you can still express love well from a distance (without touching a woman too much.For example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika appears only for the same name in the movie. I'm not sure why I accepted this. Well, this is not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Trend: I was expecting Gutham to outperform (or measure) the other. The film "Kaka Kaka". He frustrated me. It took a long time to release the film due to many issues. He slides into a few scenes. Even the obvious things have slipped from a famous outlet. <br /> <br /> In general: just a good movie. Lots of graphics. Definitely not for kids (and adults who expect a kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
