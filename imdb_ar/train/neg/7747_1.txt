Just the fact that the cover is painted, like those old B films should give you a warning about the quality of this film. This, but not film B. It's a movie D! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals - WOW - are the worst animations of data that have been introduced over the past two decades. <br /> <br /> SCAAARY sabretooth is barely visible on the front cover. You hear people screaming, bleating, dying, and sometimes you will see our teeth or the claw of a tiger. She's very amateur! Mieb is well worth watching, just because it is too bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best film I've ever seen, and wait for their reaction." <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to give it a whistle! This is the spoiler.
