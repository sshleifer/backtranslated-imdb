The film is probably the worst, it is associated with the bad name of Roger Kurman. I understood this in his early years when he had fewer budgets, but at the moment there is no excuse for putting this! I bend the movie "B" and from the point of view of certain people, all the clicks I like are set aside by "ordinary viewers", but take my word on this, Vampire makes top of my best list is the worst to imagine, vampires without fangs , The musical result is completely incorrect, the sound effects are not effective, and finally Mr.Savage does not seem to know that in a vampire film he is absolutely enchanting because he has a "not bad" career for everyone. Let me know that I will suffer strongly from this issue when I do not like a film I tend to forget.
