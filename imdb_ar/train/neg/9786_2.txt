Well, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend to attend a joke on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexy tip in it. <br /> <br /> But we decided to watch it anyway. Only for fun purposes. <br /> <br /> I am sorry, but this must be, one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> It started well, and we thought "Well this may actually be OK". But after about 10 minutes, we were unfortunately wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when it turned out that the "mysterious baller" was the most obvious character, Scouser / Australian (I say that because it was an indeterminate tone), which I might just say, was sad. <br /> <br /> And then, by that time, we all lost the will to live. Paintball Finals. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this plot is that they did not actually win, but annoying enough to have won by default. <br /> <br /> I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name given to the team was bad. Serious harm. I mean they can choose a more splendid name, like "Christ's anti-Christ destroyers" or anything else. Or that's what the film should be called anyway.
