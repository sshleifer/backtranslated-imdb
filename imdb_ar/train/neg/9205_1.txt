This movie is awesome. Bad behavior, bad writing, bad music. It's just awful. Not only is it an incredible twist to role-playing games, but the key elements in the movie are poorly executed. Our Lord, I do not believe in mercy on the souls of the miserable, the miserable, who have borne these births and begotten them.
