Vipul Shah has done some really wonderful work as a film director in the past. "Time - race with time" and "Namaste London" were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, and he produced it. His last outing as a London-based filmmaker comes in his weakest vacations. <br /> <br /> "London Dreams" has a modest story about how success turns into friendship. Agreed, has the potential but when you see the "dreams of London", you wonder what happens? This film is probably the worst peak in recent times. Vipul Shah author puts Vipul Shah director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again its climax is appalling. How can anyone forgive the person who decided to destroy you? I will not do. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness for his nappy friend, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he arrives in India, instead of slapping or insulting him, Salman welcomes him with the Baja band and says he is the reason for the total failure? Was Fabil Shah's desire to show Salman's character as God? If yes, than you have completely failed. The only question I would like to ask about Vipul Shah is, will you welcome the person who destroyed you with such a wonderful reception? Write what you feel, do not fool us (audience), we are rational enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musician but Shankar-Ishan Loi's music is awesome. There is no single song left in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is wonderful though. He holds the film on his shoulders and really does, really in the emotional scenes. But again, his character appears as God, making him look like a nape in the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman has completely immersed him. Asen gets lost, and what is a great talent like Um Puri do in this film? Ranvighi dances, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brenda Parekh is fine like a patch. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream remains a dream!
