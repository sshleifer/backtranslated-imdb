* Corrupters * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers criticizes the luster of media obsession with violence. But this disagreement ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have portrayed his armed killers as innocent and evil killers of innocent people and contradicted the fascination of the media obsessed. Instead he gives them justification. The film depicts almost every victim as a person deserving harm. By engaging in sinister stereotypes, Stone presents the victims as disturbing cartoons - stupid losers, English-speaking immigrants, and slow people. The only person committed by birds of love in murder is also a stereotype. Of course they are endorsing old American Indians who use hallucinations - because they are modern and elegant? Let's make him a great figure. Fat, Chinese scribes and "Hex" are unauthorized, so let's make it sound like death. Instead of being twisted and hated by their bad deeds, their agitation makes them happier and more loving. Micky and Malerie make funny and cool images, and must seduce surreal images to entice more people with a great impression. Justice makes fun of them. Police officers and prison officials are portrayed as hooligans, hooligans and sinners compared to GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the "reality" in the film. There is no nuance or accuracy in the movie - just simple presentations and pictures. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. The evidence of the failure of the film in his message lies in the actual reactions of the real world. Some of the frustrated young people who saw this film cited as a source of inspiration for the killings they committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with real realistic results. The smart message can not be seen anywhere.
