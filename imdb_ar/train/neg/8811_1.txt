The spoilers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie and did not see I like it <br /> <br /> The first reason: boring. Hardly anything happens. The women sit around and discuss how horrible their lives are, how they have no hope, smoke the herbs, read the magazines, take care of their sick friend, and cut off their scattered bodies. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: there are a lot of things that have not been explained. Many scenes are devoted to the zombie hunter who randomly abducts men, binds them to a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know about the illegal activity of eating sick meat? Why does someone kill someone and let another go? <br /> <br /> There is also this dude who thought at first that he also had a disease eating meat, but puts his fist on the wall with a miraculous force to indicate that it is not exactly what we originally thought! How frustrating is this? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story is interesting, the duologue boring, the work does not exist. The art of the cover is also misleading because it makes you think that this film will be great when it is not clear. I have hired this movie based on some reviews by other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people enjoyed this revocation, I will be sure from now on that I have read more than one reviewer in the depth of a movie to avoid Rent another movie I regret seeing.
