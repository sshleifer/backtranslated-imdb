Well, I know that many people might hate this review because Watership Down is "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but after watching this film for the first time at the age of 18, I must admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who chanted the words "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie as children and their feelings torn apart in layers - recommended it. To be honest, I wish I had not bothered. I gave him the benefit of doubt; generally I do not like to stop watching a movie halfway. This was an exception. It was really, really, bitterly, terribly boring. Maybe it was the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a crap in space), and I have not really "done" it. The art was fine. The backgrounds were well made if not a little nice and Toya, but the rabbits themselves were not very likable and the animation was very fast and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the huge details about the story; basically it is the story of a group of rabbits who leave Warren because of human infiltration in the area. Generally an ethical story about the risks of human interactions on the environment, it uses stereotypical rabbits to place the message across. To me, I wish they were with gas, not because I was a terrible sadist, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, boring and generally rude (I'm terribly English). I found that I was constantly looking around the clock while watching the movie and it took about 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even it was a terrible shock. <br /> <br /> If you praise in any way, I would admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the countryside and hope to reveal the arrogance of humans etc. is very good meaning. Everything is generally sacred and preaching, but the message you are trying to ask is good in nature. The musical score was not too bad. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, this movie is very bad. I could not see it all the time, or maybe I was forced to eat my legs in extreme boredom. Granted, it's not a bad "torque", but it's still not high in my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
