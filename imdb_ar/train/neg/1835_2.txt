Start with text. I have seen caricatures of a deeper depth than "envy". At any time the characters continue to repeat what I have already seen, and were not funny the first time, the film is in deep trouble, which is certainly "Envy." It was better for a movie that depends on the joke that one goes with. Here our film does not go anywhere at all. Christopher and Klein would like to forget this bomb, because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller in some good black comedy films, "Flirting Disaster" and "Duplex", comes to mind immediately. Make sure that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves a low rating, because like the subject, stinks. - Merck
