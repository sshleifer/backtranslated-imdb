drss1942 Really took the words directly from my mouth. I loved Sigal's first films and I feel that I'm the only one who is still loyal to him. I've only watched this movie (well, I've been gone about 90%, so I have not seen the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not put myself in any other film and did not dare know what happened in the end. There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of Mad Mad Max where the voice was mentioned, but in the same language (Australian is English, is not it?) Anyway, if I have 10 thumbs, they all now point to this injustice.
