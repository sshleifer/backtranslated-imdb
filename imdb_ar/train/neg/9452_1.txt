I was looking forward to seeing this when I was in production. But it turns out that this is the most disappointing number. Far from the whimsical Dr. Suss. It was vulgar and annoying and I do not think Dr. Suss would have agreed to it. How Christmas was stolen in Grinch was much better. I understand that she has some hidden adult jokes in it but my kids have not pressed yet. While the cat in the hat screamed vulgarly, I caught a lot more than I wished. I hope that Dr. Sous will do some justice.
