I can not say that Aag is Bollywood's worst film ever, because I have not seen every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it could be. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like an attempt by a suicide artist on behalf of the director, and I think he succeeded in his mission. No actor in List A will be at risk outside of this film sharing the same bills he pays for all the insult that this film must endure. <br /> <br /> But it's not just a way to blame the director here, there's the cameraman, who seems to be training this year's amateur filmmaker award. There is more than an exciting degree, hoping to take you to the next scene. A lighting man, who must be carrying a cigarette in hand and a lamp on one pole in the other, hoping that the torch that burns the cigarette will add to that the much needed light in every scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everything can be forgiven here. A group of actors was assembled in Aag to promote a new beginning and new dimensions to reproduce the most popular films in India at all, "Sholay". One must not forget that these actors were not forced to enter this film, they are from the A list and are willing to participate in something, let's face it surely the expectations of the public would have been high and eager ?? So the question is posed by Amitabh (now), did the other actors really think that their performance even tried to improve the origin? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people will remember his dialogue in this comic dislike of the film? Do not be stupid, of course not, it was an offer to the public on the amount of financial talks that could make actors walk. <br /> <br /> I really hope all participants are satisfied with what is really a vulgar attempt to reproduce a classic film that only succeeds in infecting everyone's mind when they watch the original film.
