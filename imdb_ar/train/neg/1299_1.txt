This production has no story at all. Acting is embarrassing. Dutch film star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her autobiography. She is far from flawed and I personally think she has gone beyond the limits of professional decency; in terms of exposing herself in this film. This film contains a lot of unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and a rude language. It also shows the wrong image of the Netherlands (as do most movies). Do not bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Helbrand, which proved to be the best with its proximity to the screen.
