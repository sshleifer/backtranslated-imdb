Tony Scott directs a sports flick that must attract even non-athletic fans. Some say that baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... very slow. Well float! From the outside, he seems to be a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro) while at home he is a fan of San Francisco's giant. Along comes the new slugger (Wesley Snipes) designated rescuer of the recession. Our salesman has a deadly obsession when all the hard stars collide in the worst recession of his career and the Giants fear to collapse with him. De Niro is a body terror. Snipes looks very natural like a ball player. Other notable characters include: Ellen Barkin, John Ligisamo, Benicio del Toro and Pati de Arbanville. You are a free agent ... Enjoy. Violence and very strong language is expected and you get your money.
