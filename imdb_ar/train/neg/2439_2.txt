"Intensive Care" for our role Von Roverwei is one of the worst horror films ever produced. This very cheap Dutch flick offers some loopholes and lots of ridiculous positions. The veteran George Kennedy is lost in horror just like Professor Bruckner. This procedure is very slow, and the peak is laughable. The famous surgeon has a car accident. He falls into a coma for seven years and then wakes up and continues a bloody path. "Intensive care" is clearly influenced by bright American films. Including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". The killings are fun and boxes of painful dialogue are painful. You can still give this piece of garbage a look if you are in a comfortable mood. You'll laugh until you hurt one you can believe me!
