Rajinikanth was born again after acquiring a magic force that he could use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this film which are obvious to the ordinary audience: Rajinikanth is still 50ish at home with his parents; the girl's next-door father thinks he is a convincing "boy" ("vasekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinkinth abruptly interrupts the film With his sermons, the worst thing about it is how teenage women get their exercise through domestic work - however, we believe it is not the histnist; although it was well read, it wastes six of its seven strength on a stupid kite; To continue, but you will get the picture. <br /> <br /> There is a god, there are gods, and there is Rajinkinth. The guide has difficulty installing Rajinikanth in one of these categories. At first, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth does what the Tamil heroes do - standing in front of the bad guys, and despite being older, they enjoy the most beautiful girl in the film. Rajinikanth does this well and some of the brands methods in Rajinikanth are actually enjoyable - the "alibaba number" is a novelty. What makes this film unbearable is that those first few minutes are just an introduction to the worst book ever written. Even that introduction is permeated by some comedy that is forced and clear. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero faces many obstacles (politicians, as usual) but we can not really reach the hero because we do not know what the ultimate goal of the hero. In the end, when everyone wants to be the leader, he gives the hero another of his speeches and walks away to become a recluse. The director does not provide any solution to the problem in the peak scene. <br /> <br /> A. T degree. Rahman is really interesting. Either he shows a sparkle or does not bother to invest it fully in this film - which he can blame. There is one scene where Rajinikanth steps into a car and a fraudster then throws the knife and starts counting the pope. Music is very convenient right now and acts as a catalyst to add more stress. All the songs are modest, no one bothers the songs of this film after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can set in IMDb. This movie contains all elements that justify its correct place at the bottom of the IMDb label.
