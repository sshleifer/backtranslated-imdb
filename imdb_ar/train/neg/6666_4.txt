I really wanted to like this film, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to spoil this film, - do not worry from the start, you know that something bad will happen - but here is an example of how to put this film in a dirty way. Cowboys and "twig" ride up the hill. The cowboy has a handle bar handle. A cowboy and a "twig" enter the middle of the road. The cowboy is shaven clean through the exit of the rest of the film. Sometime between fighting the shot and riding the mountain, the cowboys had time to shave, in the dark, on the back of the horse. .
