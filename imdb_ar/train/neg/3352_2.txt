I do not even know where to start this one. "Everything about the family." This must be the worst line of dialogue heard in the movie "Horror", although this can not be a horror film even if you try !!! Ugh!!! I know Owen Wilson is a better representative. He needs to stop playing the distinguished man who dies in every film (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta Jones must become a porn star. There is no room for legitimate representation. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I have ever seen
