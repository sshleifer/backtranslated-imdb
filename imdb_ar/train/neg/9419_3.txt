I never heard of this, and then I discovered that he was the man with the deadly lens, which I had heard about but had not seen. Conrey pushed me to buy it, and that's not good. He wants to be a sort of intersection between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but that's not funny, unless you find General Wombat (?) Funny. This film appears as a thriller in the seventies of the last century until the last ten minutes, when it comes alive. There are many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his aides that do not work. It looks as though the initial cut was too long, and the first half was modified to reach the story of the ransom of nuclear bombs and suicide attacks, which I think are meant to laugh, but again, that's not funny. The location photography is excellent but the studio stuff looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe the guy in charge of Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry. Just laugh: Connery casts his wig before wearing his helmet and jumping off the plane. Makes no say never again look like a genius.
