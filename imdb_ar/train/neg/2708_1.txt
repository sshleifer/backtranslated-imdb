This film disguises itself as social commentary, but in fact it is as ironic as the racism it condemns. The premise of this film: African American = strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a rifle at the age of a son and a Jewish man. The Jewish man, in a stereotype, collapses in fear and begins to plead for his life ... But the great, powerful and defiant Omar Ibs stands strong without fear. We also condemn each member of the Brotherhood as a drunk or ravenous rapist. The white girl raped, of course, begins to think of lesbians because she is just a weak white girl after all. When the white male is rejected by the brothers, he must, of course, fall down with the molten heads, unbelievable cowards, especially the great muscular man who was quickly beaten by the powerful black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP GUY twice its size ?? Yes correct. <br /> <br /> Of course, black men never reject their people and Umar moves easily with them. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens his colleagues in the white room and keeps them in the queue are just stupid - of course it is the prevailing while his weak white colleagues sit in fear of him and they turn in the end. This film was so bad, and the end made me laugh out loud. The very slow movement between Epps and Banks rejoice in the faces they make - it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​make faces on each other (all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.
