Another TV piece made of garbage! I thought the career of Telly Savalas had peaked when he made a voice on that visit to the Birmingham video which is being shown on Tarrant on TV on a half on a regular basis, but then I forgot to share it In this! I was trying to push it into my unconscious memory, but cable TV brought my memory and screamed from me !! <br /> <br /> I liked the thing (laughing sarcastically!) in the film, which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the 1940s, but a stark shot of the Zagreb Cathedral in the late 1980s. The commando steam train trains on the JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslav State Railways) on the side of the locomotive, even though the manufacturers have tried to block it. Why not only film in the UK, if this is where most of the film is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap litter, celluloid waste!
