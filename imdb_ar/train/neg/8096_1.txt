Most of the book edits are bad, but this film excluded key parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They renewed the wire, gathered the scenes and changed the arrangement. They added silly things to that that never happened in the book and never will happen. <br /> <br /> If I have not read this book in advance, it will be an incredibly boring film, it does not make you care about characters, like them or their hatred. It turns characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Ironically. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
