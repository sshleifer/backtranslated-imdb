The slippery clicks have been few and far apart for days, so when I heard about Kat I had high hopes and heard good things about them. Those good things I heard were all wrong ... very wrong! This flick is bad and I mean bad. It's just plain stupid. All about it. Especially the origin of the killer and how he survives and how he is finally taken care of. There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another wannabe wannabe with these "hip", "psychology". Characters "movie subtlety". I am very sick of this crap. Someone does something different because the slash type needs fresh blood, literally.
