Blank Check is a movie I saw on television one day, and like most movies being broadcast on television, the Blank Check was not good. First of all, no one I met ever saw a "blank check" that included people who grew up in the 1990s. Also, "empty verification" will not be remembered in the 20th century either because of the fact that it will be blocked by Pixar films. Blank Check will not call a bad film, but it's not fun either. (Or at least not to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check is not an entertainment movie because there is nothing original about it. Everything makes you go "unless I've seen this before?" Blank Check is torn and trying to take advantage of everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which is strange that both contain Macaulay Culkin). Blank Check is not a bad film, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.
