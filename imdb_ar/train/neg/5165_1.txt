I was looking forward to this trip and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful in the game of coaster and ride the amusement park. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster part was fine - it was all about 30 seconds from a 90 second flight. <br /> <br /> It was visually dull and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> It was a desperate attempt to be like a mix of riding Indiana Jones and riding the superior Space Mountain and Disneyland, and failed on every side. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or exciting at least.
