I only saw this film today, it's not only terrible and terrible, but it seems that the director got a few friends together to make a film about a sick man. I also think that this film is like a pornographic video with a clear presentation that was clearly filmed. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the heavens I work in a video store and I did not have to pay for this movie naughty x infinity .. Do not buy or sell this movie !!!!! You'll have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this piece of crap! This does not mean much about this film either. <br /> <br /> The representation is poor and the movie is inaccessible. I was watching this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the film. <br /> <br /> I walked to the house and fell after watching this movie of dirt, then I was excited and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I have half a mind, I thought about taking the film out and burning it too because it should not be subjected to anyone ... maybe members of al-Qaeda, especially those in our custody, as well as child molesters who are serving prison terms. Life without parole .... Just set up like an orange work hour, then force the cheese head to watch it over and over again.
