I would put this at the top of the list of movies in the category of trash can not change! There are bad movies, but the worst ones are the insurmountable movies, but you are supposed to like them because they are supposed to be good for you! Sex sequences, which were shocking in her day, could not even raise a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strict night high school amateur Marxism. The film is self-consciousness in the worst sense of the term. Photography in harsh black and white grainy. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. So bad sound! Some people call this art? <br /> <br />
