In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental filmmaking formats, most movies, especially genre films, should not tell the story or message only, but should enjoy their target audience in one way or another. All this is just to say that in my opinion the bad movie is not a film with low production values ​​or low budget, the bad movie is the boring film. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "Asylum of the Cursed" as it is known in the United States, is a bad film just because it does not include, boring and irremediably boring. While it has a very good hypothesis, it is not well developed and mediocre representation does not improve things. On the other hand, it was probably a good B movie or even a classic, but this is just a bad filmmaking attempt. <br /> <br /> Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stacey), a young psychiatrist who just got his dream job at St. Andrew's Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to be hiding a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and constant rumors of demonic practices, James decides to discover what is going on; only to find the credibility of his boss, Dr. McCourt (Bruce Pine), who believes the bishop is going mad like his patients. <br /> <br /> While the hypothesis is very interesting, the execution of the film leaves much to be desired. In an attempt to make a supernatural psychic thriller, Jones goes to the easy road and makes a film full of all kinds of cliches. Of course, there are a lot of great movies full of clichés; but in "Hellborn", everyone is thrown into panic and a cheap leap to keep things going, resulting in a boring and predictable story. <br /> <br /> Representation is very modest for the most part, with a big exception: Bruce Payne offers a great performance that makes the film seem unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stacy is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the actors make forgotten performances. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, one thing must be written about "Heilburn"; it has a very good visual look for the budget and is very similar to the modern "high-budget" Hollywod horror productions. Also, make-up and artificial limbs are done very well and the main discount designs are very good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, making a great contrast with make-up and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie that contains a few good things beyond its serious flaws with terrible consequences. Hardcore fanatics or B movies may be interested in its hypothesis but it is a boring and cumbersome experience. 10/03
