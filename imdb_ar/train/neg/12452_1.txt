This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What is wrong with the burning hole with writers, producers and directors? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is funny, the acting is lousy at best, the story ... what's the story? The first battle in this movie is fine, but it continues to repeat until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest loser for not stopping this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie just because Scott Adkins was ... and it is there ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> Give it 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest score provided by IMDb. <br /> <br /> Give yourself an advantage: Watch Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... it's worth more than your time.
