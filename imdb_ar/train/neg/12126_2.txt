Here again, there is another Diane Lane film where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role you know how to play? This time she was caught in 1969 cheating on her husband with a blouse man. I am not surprised because this is very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and gives milk. I would not be surprised if I grew up with a milk man. Would not be surprised if you slept with an ice cream man too because this is a very boring film. Then after dumping some milk, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. Doh. Then, while she was making it with him, her son became infected with wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at the wasps' nest. This little mother did not have time to tell him that she was too busy with the man's blouse.
