There is nothing like watching giant robots fight a battle on barren desert land, and do not offer robot wars. Certainly the representation is lousy, the dialogue is substandard, the characters are one-dimensional, but they have giant robots! Special effects are actually very good for this period. It is certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains minimal computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked in view of the short-run time of films, and it has a certain humor in parts that make it very enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who loves giant robots or cheesy science fiction who is looking for an hour of distraction.
