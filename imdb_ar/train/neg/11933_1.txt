My child makes better videos than this! I feel like I'm separated from the $ 4.00 that I spent in renting this thing! There is no history of the video case, it seems designed by Wellspring; worse, there is no production history for the original movie included anywhere in the movie! The only date is set for 2002, prompting an unexpected tenant to believe he will get a recent film. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad from its outdated point of view and irrelevant to any period of time but precisely when it was presented. I am surprised that anyone will take the time and expense to market it as a video. It may be of interest to students who study anti-war culture in the 1960s, anti-war, anti-institution culture, synthesizing, operating, and leaking; but when you read the back of the video situation, there is no hint that this is what you get. If you make a mistake renting it, it may be better to watch it while you are taking drugs, so that your mind is more consistent with the wavelengths of the minds of the directors, Vassbinder and Fingler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching, I can tell you that the first scene is not getting better, so knowing that, I'm sure you'll fall asleep quickly long before the end.
