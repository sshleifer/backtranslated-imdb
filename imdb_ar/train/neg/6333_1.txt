I've seen this movie already in the theater. As soon as the treasurer handed over my money, she said two words I had never heard of in a demobilized person, either before or since: "No refund" Once I heard these words, I had to give my own farewell to my money and go home. But no, foolishly, I entered and watched the film. This movie did not make anyone in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even unintentionally! Mostly, we sat there dumbfoundedly. Every ten minutes or so, someone yells "This movie sucks!" The audience applauded enthusiastically, then sat there in astonishing silence and bored for another ten minutes.
