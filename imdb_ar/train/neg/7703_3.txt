Master introduced a celebrity entering the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and escapes while an elderly lady suffers a heart attack. The name of the female killer Sawa. She still goes to school and works for a wicked criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day Sawa discovers that she has killed her parents .. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that the thriller Gore Festival is disappointing. "Kites" have a pattern, but they are still garbage. She tried the strange plot about a teenage girl who kills people as a killer to be scary and touch her at the same time, causing the story to fall on her face. One of the highlights is the sequence of motion in which the good / bad hero falls with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure is not as good as coordinated with director Yasumi Omitsu for the exotic and personal animations of his character. It is terrible. Not only that, sexual sequences are simply simply creeping. <br /> <br /> Row: 3/10
