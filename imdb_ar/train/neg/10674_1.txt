This is classified as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Along with Cuba and Angie, representation is already embarrassing. Archer was not once a decent actress? what happened to her? The work is decent but unbelievable. Makeup is very bad is worth mentioning. I mean, who even thinks of make-up in a contemporary feature film. Someone must tell the artist make-up, the DOP that he is not supposed to see already. The end is a big disappointment - like "then they realized it was just a dream" <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. You are better off just staring at space for two hours.
