This movie was in chaos. She had the absolute worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of the scene wanted the writer to go to commercials, the second director of the black screen to bring the book's dream. <br /> <br /> Under anarchist trend and liberalization, there was a glimmer of something good. Good idea, convincing spark. But something went wrong somewhere. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a pseudo-priest trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing hard to deal with is Richard Greco priest. Well, the part does not call him to be a good priest and succeed well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy bad guy. He always plays bad guy crazy. It is very. <br /> <br /> Oh, I was thinking that perhaps all this terrible, free and separate plot was not connected trying to add to the sense of confusion that was experienced by the character (Greco). And only to prove that they were contrived, rolled into credits. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
