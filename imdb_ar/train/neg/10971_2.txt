How irate Irish critics of this film. Overpriced by the usual band of Irish actors pulling out every Irish movie. A terrible scenario, with forced personal quirks (brown sauce). Romance is all that is bad in Dublin. "Ah, it's a dump, but it's certainly not wonderful at all." Lots of anecdotes for the American audience only (the head of the supermarket and his dreaded forced logo). The nail in the coffin was the figure of Colm Minne. A wonderful actor had to play this part that could have been written by a five-year-old child. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, which is bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he was not putting his horrible American accent. International audiences warn: Stay home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You'll have a better time. The rest is the outer walk
