How this film can miss a lot of wonderful, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is really wonderful. An incredible and intolerable plot, deep ankle characterization and really awesome music (replacing tension with vast areas of noise, replacing obscure musical references to the original collisions), then there are specific references to the origin that are only "coated" on the cracks ... In a world where a dead American dies back from the Italian film show (Tear Show), get Carter (sagging uncontrollably) and two thousand recently smashed our screens, this one takes the equivalent biscuits. Time has ever been a wonder ... garbage.
