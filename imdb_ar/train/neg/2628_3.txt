Sydney JFree's director at Hollow Point designed a futuristic post-modern masterpiece that challenges the public and surprises them constantly. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furey has dared to ask what happens to traditional tired models of "conspiracy" and "profiling" when they remove the "drive" and "mind" crutches. <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion can not rise. <br /> <br /> One and a half star. <br /> <br /> P.S. This film has no meaning, law enforcement personnel are not welcome and organized criminals are full of madness.
