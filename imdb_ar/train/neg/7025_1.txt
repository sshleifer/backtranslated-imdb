I wish I could give this movie zero or less, because unfortunately this is what it deserves. I honestly did not get out of a movie, but it was so awful that I could not stand another minute of it. Please, please, please - for humanity - skip this movie. If you want a hot gay movie you can actually do, that's not the case. <br /> <br /> It has unattractive, unattractive lines, a volatile structure and a ridiculous dialogue, and is not entirely convincing in every imaginable way. At the very basic level, it fails in entertainment. All about "Mango Kiss" is very fun, it's worse than any student film I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, the whole movie relies on a fixed voice (I mean CONSTANT) on the narration. The scriptwriter may have written a novel, because they insisted on telling everything, rather than showing it. We are supposed to assume that Lou and Sasafras are the best friends and have a special relationship, although there is no personal development to illustrate this. In addition, this film continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in the frame freeze the characters with their names written on the screen. There is no introduction, no evolution of any of the characters. We do not really recognize any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm an anomalous woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another weird woman) and found this movie to be a depressing representation of the alien cinema. I began to think that lesbian and gay films are very similar to Christian rock music - no matter how awful they are, people will flock to it and defend it, regardless of poor quality. Please do not rent this! Instead, let's encourage the production of gay and gay films by renting "but I am a fan," "fire," or "celestial creatures," instead of swallowing anything that is unintentional for the gay community (Queer as Folk).
