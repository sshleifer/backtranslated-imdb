Man, this gets a lot of good reviews in review books. Honestly, I found it very slow and unattractive from the start. I kept waiting until I moved a little but that never happened. This film is highly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, has never appealed to me, anyway, so it may just be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film where they show Ronald Coleman playing the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The good points of the film - thanks to an improved version - include some fit cinematography and a young Chilean, young and skinny and attractive. <br /> <br /> In general, this is simply too boring, and there is a lot of repetition in some scenes that can not be seen again. In addition, we all know that most actors are controversial cases, anyway, but glory to Hollywood to show them here in this story.
