I can not say that this is the worst film ever produced, but I personally think about it this way because when it was originally released in the theaters, (1) the first engagement was positive enough that my friend insisted on seeing it, STOOD IN LINE for tickets, and (2) still the only "hard" film I remember as the audience started to cheat at a certain point and basically laughed at the film the rest of the way. Once we get to the infamous (and never ending) snakes battlefield, I think everyone has surrendered. <br /> <br /> The only positive I can give up on is the portrayal of the fertile site. Oh, and there are also Bo's breasts, although their representation is too wooden to the point that nudity is no stranger and does not classify more than just a Playboy cameraman. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Tension" in this film falls between Bo's terrible acting and her husband's terrible direction. The Snake Battle must be one of the most "unfit" events that have ever been filmed. However, this one of those bad enough movies, may be worth watching on the level of unintended humor. Definitely the worst movie I ever paid.
