This western is very bad because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like he was shot in California instead of Jack Slade and Tuffy, Idaho, Colorado and Montana. She imagines all that is known about this mysterious bad man, the "good man". The scenario is terrible. There is very little direction, poor representation. Dorothy Malone is completely lost as his wife. Mark Stephen does not seem to know how to portray the mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a good supervisor on the stage line. He was frightened by his local inhabitants because of his hard drinking. When he is drunk the fights will start and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure that he could not intimidate them again, the trainees executed Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. This is a terrible film. I can not recommend anyone to watch this film other than seeing how Hollywood records history as it pleases, to this day.
