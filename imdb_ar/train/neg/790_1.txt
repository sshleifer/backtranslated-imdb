Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The BBC3 President needs to develop programs targeting a different audience to BBC1 and BBC2 to maintain license and functionality. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry presents him with unfamiliar friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The BBC president picks them up, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. Characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person does this kind of thing, there will be a fuss! <br /> <br /> Trash.
