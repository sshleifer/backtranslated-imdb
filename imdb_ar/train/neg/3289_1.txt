I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be good to destroy one of the best programs on TV. Do we really need a large redesign? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how fans would feel if they remake the Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, and took all the music and made it a drama. Do you think they love it! This film does not have the same feeling as the original film. Of course, the original was sometimes trite, but Bo and Locke were always nice, they had a problem because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main aim was to help people who passed through the town. None of this mattered to the people who made the film, and perhaps did not see the original show until the end. My big question is, what will you destroy after that?
