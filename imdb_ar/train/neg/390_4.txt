I loved the apprentice in the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with the fifth season? (Or is it 6?) Things are getting very tired. <br /> <br /> I used to like this show, but it became his Donald Trump Ego Festival. Granted his company will work on it, but come on! Some things say "YOU FIRED" is just an insult. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I do not want to work for it. Not because he is arrogant, so handsome or so. It's just that the offer is unrealistic and that the way it deals with things makes me feel bad. Good entertainment? Yes, but tired because the back challenge becomes very tired .. It's not a team, it's not personal, it's just work. Watch your back jack.
