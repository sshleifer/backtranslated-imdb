There is a lot of talk about torture these days. This all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes susceptible to two psychotic women. Since then, he has only assaulted him for kicking. I do not know any time you do anything about it. There is a wife and child there somewhere; he has a great sense of guilt and fear. But there should have been some times when he could have acted. The film seems to be a joke to someone. I suppose in the aftermath of Manson's murders, we had a bit of fixation on these two instances. However, why does someone make such a film? What appeals only has to sadism. The conclusion is not entirely satisfactory, but it could have been treated with a clear plot point. Oh, okay. Another hour and a half of my life.
