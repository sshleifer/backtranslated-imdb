Quite simply, I am not fond of Westerners. And because I did not try anyone from start to finish, I decided to watch "Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how painful I felt. At first it was painful as expected. I found that the acting is laughable, the scene (traditional candy, horses and cowboys) is dull and the music has its timing on the painful edge. However, after talking about myself mentally, after the first 20 minutes, it became easier for me. The focus on cinema, and how John Ford managed to make the dimest positions (boring in my opinion) look amazing at times, make them more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go any further to say that I enjoyed the film at the end. However, it was good for me to sit all the way to the end, which in itself impresses me.
