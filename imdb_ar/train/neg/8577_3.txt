I knew that my summary would get you. How is this movie like Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived in the 1970s and 1980s, you probably can not understand why anyone wants to eat new coke or own a rock house (and frankly, at least in the case of House Rox, I do not quite understand it). These are just two things that seem logical at the time, but they are the younger generation. The same could be said for Kai Kaiser and his band. At that time (in the 1940s), she was very popular and had enough influence that he starred in the studio with Boris Karloff, Bella Lugosi and Peter Laurie in this film. However, if you are not living at that time (it was before my time well), then you are wondering why anyone likes this kind of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his teammates are incredibly repulsive, and very humorous (ie undeveloped and fleshy). Frankly, I have not been able to stand up to their strange behavior and I do not appreciate having too many musical numbers in the film. Given these factors, the big support team has been given a back seat, and fans are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film includes Kyser and the band comes to a palace where there was a young lady and her aunt aunt live. Once you arrive, the bridge is washed and strange events begin. Eventually, crowned in some attempts to the life of Sally and SÃ©ance (of some kind). Everything is played for laughter - it's really not a horror film though cast. <br /> <br /> In general, it's acceptable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I certainly felt cheated to see Kyser and his head's detailed head.
