The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the end laugh. I had great hopes because I usually loved horror movies on a bad holiday, but this was not qualified. It's really just a bad attempt to show your personal slide slowly into madness, which is again not a bad plot, but poorly implemented here. There are some scenes (such as the end) that are not meant to be funny, but they actually made me laugh out loud. There were several times when I thought the film would go in an interesting direction, but it never met what it could be and what it should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
