We thank G_d for being bombarded, or we may deal with some delights like "Skate Fu" where we can see the likes of Brian Boitano doing a Triple Lutz job and lowering the bad guys into ribbons with sharp ski strips, but I go on. The only thing that could have helped Turkey might be a little T & A from Mrs. Agbayani. It is not as if the world would see something new (at least that part of the world that Playboy has seen spreading). I really think that pornographic fit her "talents" better, although Aubrey Hepburn could not stay standing on her feet this sewer. One explanation for the presence of Kurt Thomas can be a painful brain injury, perhaps by going out often on intimidation. It is good that the IOC was not keen on "doping" as it is now, or that Kurt would have been stripped of his medals. Must be avoided at all costs.
