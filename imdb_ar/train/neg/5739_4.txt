A small town attacked by a crowd of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a single avenger and a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> "Darkness" was released in 1993, and received something from the following cult when it was released. It's easy to find out why it's loaded (and I mean to upload) with Gore, and it's power and enthusiasm, like those in other non-budget horror movies like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback" To some extent. <br /> <br /> While this may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save it. The film was filmed on Super 8, so the picture is grainy and dark, making seeing things very difficult (it would have been great if masked the horrifying Puerians heroes.) Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what it is with these Horror No Budget Horror and Bad Death Metal?) While no one expects Oscar's worthy performances, the hourly representation is still strictly amateurish, where actors sometimes seem confused rather than fear or threat. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of budget-free festivals will love this. Everyone though, wish there was a little more meat on the ribs.
