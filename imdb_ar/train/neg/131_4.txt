So, where are the cannibals? Those who are intrigued by the title and call the "real cannibals" for this film will fail. Instead, a strange man shows up and re-visits the indigenous village of Papua New Guinea, one of whom was his lover several decades ago. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, a Jew in New York during his coming, somehow overlaps with the documentary because it appears in Yamika in many scenes. <br /> <br /> Some indigenous people have Tobias himself. Not all of that together is a bad film. The cinema is very interesting and great. Schneebaum is still very loved all the time and provides us with a wonderful glimpse into life as far from Western civilization as one can get. <br /> <br /> It's not just what you claim to be on the cover and in the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
