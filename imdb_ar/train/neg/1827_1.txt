Stars envy some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Emmy Boehler, Christopher Walker. With such a cast, one can only expect the best. However, with "Envy", no one can save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderbark (Black) are the best friends and co-workers in a glass paper factory. They both earn a decent living, but since Tim has a better performance at work, he is able to bear more than his buddy Nick. Nick is the dreamer who always presents new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick came up with the idea of ​​a spray can disappear tube dogs (yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with this idea, Nick decided to invent this product really. He offers Tim's offer to invest in his idea and share 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think that the idea will ever work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious) ends up earning millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and a wonderful desert. Tim starts feeling envy for Nick. Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it is still terrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogue and very poor performance of all actors. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. It was not even Christopher Wokin the Great, who played a homeless character called "Jee Man", making this movie funny. The film is bad from the start and continues to worsen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you: * love the waste (do not mean pun) * want to see Jack Black in white Texas <br /> <br /> say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid it in particular If: * You feel insulted by humor * You love animals
