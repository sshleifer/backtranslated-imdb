Well its responsible. They just killed the American pie. The first three were completely hysterical, but this and other people were horrifying. I mean the story revolves around two brothers in college competing for each other's houses, I mean to talk about a weak conspiracy, the first three to deal with growth, change and marriage, all points worthy of development in human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to try comparing yourself with Steven Stifler but not even a cigar. I give this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this film is Jim's father course I do not know why he continues to do these poor things advanced movies.
