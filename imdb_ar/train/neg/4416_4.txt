A darker pile of death is given near the end of the display, a pile less than the beliefs of the Catholic Church and its teachings. Throughout the play, dark humor is a way of asking many common rhetorical questions, especially "If God is good, why does evil exist in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (although some may disagree) that they are typical religious teachers who spread the "corporate line" and condemn half of the world to be burned in hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of her school, she invites her first students to return and perform the Christmas Festival. <br /> <br /> However, when the "Quartet" is "updating" their play to distort the teachings of the "Sister Mary" wrong, pushed on the edge, sending the story escalated into a series of unhappy events. The end finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go watch the play instead.
