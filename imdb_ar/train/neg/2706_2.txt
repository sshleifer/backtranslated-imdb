Yes, people are racist. People are so racist in college. This is a good point, and racism has been dealt with many times before in countless movies. What distinguishes higher education apart from the package is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most poignant and predictable way, oh yes it's in college as well. <br /> <br /> This film deals with the problem of racism in the way Frankenstein deals with most of the problems: it hits you on your head over and over again in a brutal and slow way. Most of the characters are caricature cartoons (female lesbian, angry black man), interacting with situations as dramatically and as possible as possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes, this film is too crowded. Black men, angry at deception, female hatred, hate men, etc. (even a feminist carries a banner reading "Dead men do not rape." See what I mean?) I do not want to give up anything, but in this film if someone What seems like a lonely and gorgeous or ravenous history may be acting exactly how you expect them. The changes in the characters seem obvious to everyone except the people in the film. The big shift in the conspiracy depends on whether the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. I think you just have to watch what happens. <br /> <br /> The other problem I face with this film is that it is supposed to be "brave" and "tough", but they have made the bad Nazis. I agree that the Nazis are evil, but this is my point of view. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad. We do not open any new ground here. The Nazis have been portrayed as evil since the 1930s. The film does not challenge any views or make bold statements. It deals only with issues that we all know in a complex way, especially after school. Being anti-racist, anti-racist and anti-Nazi, you do not take a tough stance on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher education is predictable, a caricature, and a stupid word. Avoid at all costs.
