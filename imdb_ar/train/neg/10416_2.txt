Before watching this movie, I said I loved everything Cathy Bates did. Now everything is minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, acting. Someone should tell him that "the poor" is not synonymous with dirty, ignorant or vulgar. As previously described by Randy Quaid. The only recovery feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough representative to withstand this chaotic mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can offer. <br /> <br /> I am a serious fan of both independent and exotic films, but this is very terrible.
