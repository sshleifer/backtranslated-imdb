The "darkness" was somewhat amusing, but there seemed to be no conspiracy, lacking one more than the other films that were accused of this harm: "bad taste". I've started really good, with a guy running out of something. It was very creepy in the first few minutes, but after a while the film became fun at the level of the pit, and it was difficult to produce at some points because of poor lighting and terrible recording quality anyway. It was hard to believe the film because of the representation of the events, which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera, queuing in transition. This, with no plot at all, made it look as though the film had started without a script of any kind and ended without it. As previously said, Gore was the only drawing point for this film, which was often difficult to perform.
