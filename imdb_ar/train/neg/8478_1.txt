Perhaps this was the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Henson could not show any dissatisfaction. At the beginning of the film, you were supposed to feel frustrated. Instead, she bowed her head and her lower lip. She cries pitiful without any tears for the sight of crying. I was almost angry that of all the girls who wanted to be acting, they had to get rid of them. Everyone was suffering from over-representation as well. It was flat annoying. It was also an insult to see skiers. It took Jordan a month to train as a person making the Olympic team. It spits practically on the effort of real character skiers put into their work. His deplorable excuse for a film, a pitiful attempt to connect hockey and skiing. Do not waste your life. It is not worth even a single star.
