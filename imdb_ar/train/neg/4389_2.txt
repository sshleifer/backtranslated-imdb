If you love custom sometimes with a slap comedy at the high school level, look for anything else. <br /> <br /> Starting about halfway around, beautiful and exciting Arielle Dombasle starts walking around every opportunity. This is the only thing that made this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The story is lame and not full of vitality, humorous humor, and personal development are basically absent.
