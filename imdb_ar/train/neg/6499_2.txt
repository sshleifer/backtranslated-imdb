What a mess. I've seen this with a friend for a while, and we both regard ourselves as open to many of the wonders of cinema, but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> While there may be something very good ideas / concepts and there are definitely some good performances (under these circumstances), everything is buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony derives much of the same set of genes as Natural Born Killers, U Turn, and similar films on editing, or perhaps sees himself in Nixon to seek inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he has a style of madness most often. <br /> <br /> He quotes from the statement that he made the film as if it were a joke that says it all. Not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
