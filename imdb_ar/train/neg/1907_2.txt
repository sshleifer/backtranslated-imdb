This extremely bad piece of garbage has managed to be racist, sexually biased, and gay at the same time, while pretending to be stylish and terribly sophisticated. Terrible performances, vulgar script, and boring direction, make this film one to give up. There were two particularly offensive scenes - the scene in which Gash removed him from his tongue after kissing him by another man (could it have been that big) and the scene in which Eastwood was kissed by Schaech's best friend, who pretended to be Russian . After he left the room, I yelled "King of foreigners **"! Being an intellectual artist dreams of living in Paris! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a popular actor on the screen, and he has a striking appearance. It is shameful that he did not learn more than to work with the progressive filmmaker Gennes Jark Araki in a previous film, and try to save the film from landing into a series of gay stereotypes and a culture of homophobia.
