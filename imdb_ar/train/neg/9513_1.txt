I tried watching this movie three separate times. Tonight she hired it. I passed about 20 minutes in the hope that it would be better if I spent a night in rest. I saw another 15 people the next day, almost coming to terms with her stupidity ... It was not funny at times it was a fun movie to watch, but this was just nonsense with big capital (if you know what I mean by the controlled world we live in) . Finally on the third day I watched more than an hour of the stupid thing and did not enjoy the moment! And not even one. How to get this green text. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - One for the cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
