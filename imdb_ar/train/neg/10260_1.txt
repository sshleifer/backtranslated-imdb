This movie was terrible, I hired it and I do not know what I was expecting. I watched the first five minutes and the film and knew it was a bomb. The acting was bad and there was no conspiracy. The beast is fake. The mouth does not move. Also why do they have a doctor playing xylophone to kill the monster. Just bad bad do not waste your time. (1 of 10)
