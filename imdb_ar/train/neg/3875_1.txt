I've seen lots of stupid schemes in my time, but this is one of the worst. After a few diseases in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then I go into a state of agitation, kill people (how do I get past me; I just watch them, I can not explain them.) This is the kind of film that should not be in the first place.
