One has to wonder if there is a scenario <br /> <br /> At any time in the production of this film had any meaning. Was the period of hard cutting 3 hours long <br /> <br /> and was it cut in a state of uncooperative chaos that survived? <br /> <br /> Why does anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a well-looking young man who does what he can <br /> <br /> through the dialogue and dramatic situations (?) That are presented to him. But the characters come and go for no apparent reason, and the continuity does not exist, the representation, the cinematography, and the direction (politely placed) of the hobbyist. One Sleeps is not an unfortunate choice <br /> <br /> because it will prove to be incorrect if anyone actually tries to watch this movie.
