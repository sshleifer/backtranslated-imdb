Oh my God! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends screamed like a fool "Test Johnny" while we were playing video games. I thought it was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life) and change "Quest" with "Test". It's strange that I'm wrong, but in fact I was wrong, he did not change anything, he heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network would be launched. What is the plot of this show, so I'm adventurous to watch it, here's my answer, "I want to go back to you again" (because I saw this nonsense and "My Gym Partner's a Monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen At first, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot, oh, where is the ethic? No less plot this show - revolves around a boy whose amazing smart sisters must have a lab and experiment with their brother. Why his name Johny TEST, it's a test of his sisters' experiences. <br /> <br /> You know, I honestly do not miss Dexter b (before being converted to NEW Dexter, too crap). This is a good old show, but it's very bad, you do not see it, do something more productive in half an hour than watching this nonsense.
