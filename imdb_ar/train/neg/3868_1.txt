If you are studying Welles and would like to know how far the Citizen Kane has fallen, this film will prove it. The cheap argument of making the protagonist a puppet admits himself to explain how such a semi-baked scheme could fail to explain the absurd courtroom play and the ridiculous changes that ensued in the end. Not rated as high for this movie in decibels as I was; all I can guess is that there are a lot of old fans Willis and Hayworth there.
