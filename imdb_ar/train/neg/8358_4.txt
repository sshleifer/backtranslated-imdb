This is not one of Arbuckle's movies or Keaton's best, that's for sure. Fati's wife was tired of all his heavy drinking, so I took him to a clinic where the psychiatrist Keaton claims he has a safe treatment! Well, as soon as he arrives there, Arbache accidentally eats a thermometer and is transferred to the surgery. Then he runs away and chases the place where he meets a nice girl who wants to escape as well. Finally, although the staff are chasing them, they run away. At this point it becomes clear that the girl is crazy and that Arbakl will soon regain control. However, he wakes up and everything after surgery was just a dream - there was no crazy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton was not as incompetent as he looked great in a dream. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Surely the irony of people with mental illness is fairly low, but at that time it was guaranteed to laugh. I will laugh too, if there is something funny to answer it! There is a lot of energy and all that. <br /> <br /> For your information - in one sequence sequence, Fatty wonders in a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds?). Shortly thereafter, he returned to a post that the figure 5 had just drawn. As a result, the five are now on the back of a faded shirt and appear to be a regular participant. However, the figure should be shown back on a faded shirt but it came out in the foreground - wrong, so they were supposed to realize that the mirror image would have appeared back.
