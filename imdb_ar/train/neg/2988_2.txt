First, I really enjoyed Zombi 2 from Lucio Fulci. This film was absolute trash. I could not stand to watch it. The story was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is a joke more. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People go back to life. However, this film is not worth a dollar to hire. I really enjoyed the lucio fulci movies but this was terrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how zombi 4 and 5 occur, I think I'll just take it. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a fantastic game.
