Even the first 10 minutes of this film were appalling. It is hard to believe that anyone other than John Kozak would have put the money into it. Due to the destruction of a series of anti-army / war films at the box office, it is inconceivable that Astudois of any kind wants to be associated with this script. <br /> <br /> At first, it may seem like some politically motivated derivatives from Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But after only about 90 seconds of film, it became clear that this was an unrivaled attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I loved a lot of Cusacks so much that I thought I would risk seeing the DVD of this movie. I have to say that I do not know if Kozak is wise enough for me to see another feature that will starve him again unless someone else can. Kozak seems to have suffered irreparable damage because of his hatred of George W. Bush and the Iraq war to the extent that he is ready for suicide. Tom Cruise was not close to being gone away. Not so close.
