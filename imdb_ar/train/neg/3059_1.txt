Well, I've recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquer the two marinas. Although the kids were more sadistic at SCCTM, I would say that Santa Claus had a much worse film. As a Spanish task in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we're watching a movie, we're all just talking and eating food, but not for this film. I have kept everyone there open-jaw wondering what will happen to Mr. Pitch afterwards. Will Merlin Santa Claus Help !? Or will the reindeer of his robot come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of trash that I have ever seen and loved it for it. :Dr
