I have read some comments about this film, and I can only understand that some people enjoy it easily. This film is nothing. It is very poorly written, directed and behaved so that it has almost no impression. The characters speak in vulgar dialogue and the situations are completely implausible. Although this may make this game fun and enjoyable, it is not because everything is so important, where the film becomes dull. It seems like Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling in her sex life but then was not allowed by studio executives to tell the story some real stories or had no one else. This movie can be included in the encyclopedia as a bad movie for Lifetime TV.
