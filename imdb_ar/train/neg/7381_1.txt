Well, first, Siegal's voice was released on more than 50% of the film ... Why? Because it is clear that there was a rewriting of the script and story while filming and they need to change his dialogue for the continuity of the story because they have multiple versions. From the start, you just scratch your head because the excess amounts consumed not only grab your attention, but make no sense. <br /> <br /> However, the story is still absorbing and meaningless at all. When I got to the end, I scratched my head because the film was useless and the end was not logical. <br /> <br /> Avoid like plague. This movie has made me stop watching Seagal directly to the videos because it gets worse and worse.
