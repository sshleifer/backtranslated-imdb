Well, it's Robin Hood as a "stranger" completely ... just as it is advertised! It did not seem very hopeful, and unfortunately, it was worse than I thought. <br /> <br /> The Robben man I can handle; Robin who intertwines with the daughter of Pig's pig. But it is hard to swallow Robin, who is sharing the ridiculous jokes with his individual followers, and Robin's entire kiss, which seems to have trouble managing its lines, is the kiss of death. How can anyone allow such difficult delivery without re-shooting the viewer? Again and again, it seems as though he is struggling with a completely incomprehensible Shakespeare instead of leaving him making fun of salty; I initially hoped that it was just a failed comedy in a character clearly dedicated to the comedian's role, but then spread throughout the team Actors. <br /> <br /> Anything else you say about Errol Flynn in this role, he had the talent to deliver a naturally high-level dialogue as if he had thought about it at the moment ... As this production illustrates, this is not easy Absolutely sounds! If they portrayed the characters as cheeky, the actors involved should have been given appropriate lines: they seemed to have no idea how to deal with them. <br /> <br /> I am afraid I did not like even a pantomime sheriff, for a similar reason; obviously the lines are not meant to be taken seriously but are delivered (in this case written) with a push and a wink in the audience. They are in the wrong place - fourth things that penetrate the wall - but in fact it's not funny. <br /> <br /> This promised production reminded me of a lot of squeaky school play. The only actor and character I ever felt was Gisborne, who played the role of the only man who seemed to have had any dealings with a credible betrayal and (b) a reliable description - but frankly, I would not have been able to say that It was a good waste to the future of the chain! At the time of writing this report, I will give him another chance in the hope that things will get better and sleep a bit by next week, with a less complicated scene and perhaps more satisfied actors for dialogue. After all, the inaugural "Doctor Who" Although it was not close to this bad. But if I do not see any improvement after Episode 2, I'm afraid that the series has definitely lost a viewer. <br /> <br /> It would be unfortunate, because I got a comfortable place for "Robin Hood" on screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the strong dependence of Richard Green, but this Robin failed to move my blood down.
