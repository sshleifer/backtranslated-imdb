Mr. Perlman gives outstanding performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to struggle by writing written text and some illogical pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in a complete "Die Hard" mode with his shirt and swollen muscles, and I'm sure he can do better but seem satisfied to assemble and roll up his part. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Erika is very ornate (although it is fully covered!) and some signs of "getting" appear on the representation at the end. <br /> <br /> SFX is mainly poor from CGI and is stolen from other movies. <br /> <br /> Shooting skills are trivial - deserve team A / Team <br /> <br /> Not worth watching even for Perlman - AVOID
