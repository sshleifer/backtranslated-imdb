I grew up on Superman II ("S2T") as if I loved it more than the first part, because it was not just that it contained more Superman and three Superman villains, but suddenly it started? ? Best Kent Kent for Superman Transformations and Rescue Scenes. Children no longer wait impatiently until Superman appears on the screen, as in the first part. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty fell with the S2T (see: My Assessment.) I have always heard about the background story about how to prematurely and unjustly expel the original director, Richard Donner from Part Two. (It should be rare at the time to shoot two separate films at once, and now it is common: "Back to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after watching the movie Richard Downer S2RD I'm still not able to fully recommend it ... Gone are the great change scene of Superman, the whole Paris rescue, as it was a wonderful summary of the first part in the opening of S2T.In fact, they have all written the following words: "Superman Superman ??" in S2RD The special effects were not great in the first part or the S2T, but the S2RD, were mostly laughable ?? like Louis drops from the Daily Planet window. That some new scenes have worked and some of them have been welcomed as welcome, like any scene in the Honeymoon Suite.In general, if I grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child ?? do not excel as I do as an adult, you should see the S2RD completely because it is an experience A completely new childhood with dozens of new scenes. (Alarm spoiler) Unfortunately, the worst change finally comes: it has also been an exotic memory loss kiss from the S2T that has been replaced by the same end as "I." This is not just a lazy copout, It is not logical why Clark returns to this dinner if these events do not happen. Will it continue to "restore time" to all confrontation?
