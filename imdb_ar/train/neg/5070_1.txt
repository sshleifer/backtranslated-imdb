Television affects the community ... See only the large increase in the popularity of cappuccino shops after the appearance of this small shallow work. In addition, real people who appear to be in such good condition do not suffer from any problems. <br /> <br /> In addition, does anyone really believe that these people can live in a nice loft in Manhattan taking into account what they do for living? NBC likes only to insult the intelligence of the viewer, even if they are close to the level of jump. I know someone who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one bedroom apartment in Manhattan at a cost of $ 2200 per month. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an offer called Phriends, where there are six horrible people in blocked jobs, living in a shaky neighborhood where the sirens go off constantly, and someone is robbed every week ... Then the landlord jacks up rent. Now to watch.
