Horror pictures of poverty in the 1930s and 1940s destroy hell. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but the films produced in that period have a bleak and ruthless look - and in the final analysis, not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than the wreck at the bottom of a barrel like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bella Lugosi, long after his arrival at "Dracula", plays the role of another insane doctor; Elizabeth Russell can not bear playing his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a dubious young reporter (Loana Walters), the coffin is more comfortable than the bed. Is hum. Angelo Rosito and Minerva Eurekal are also within reach, which may satisfy hardcore fans in the 1930s and 1940s.
