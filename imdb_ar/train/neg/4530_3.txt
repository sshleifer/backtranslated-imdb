SPLIT Second may be a good movie. A story about the murder of "Wrath on the Road", she has a very small Cliff Owen performing well; but ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, filmmakers have reduced their own film with the stupid camera work and editing Really horrible. The camera moves around the design in a failed attempt (I think) to reflect Owen's strain of work, family and traffic. What this actually does is give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Since filmmakers have not been interested in making a good film, but just to convince each other by portraying them stupid, you should not waste time in this farce.
