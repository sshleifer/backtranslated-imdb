The Mummy's Tomb begins by reviewing the events at The Mummy's Hand, then moving the story forward for several years and across the ocean to the United States, where the current high priest and mummy Kharis began to bring chaos and revenge to those who had violated the cemetery in the past. <br /> <br /> While I completely loved the Mummy with Boris Karloff as Imhotep's mummy, and I totally loved the Mummy Hand with Tom Tyler as Chris (he is a direct Breckwell), I was not taken with The Mummy's Tomb. <br /> <br /> It was made in a similar style to the previous film and has a somewhat similar layout, albeit in a new place. Lon Chaney Jr is fine like Chrys, but does not really stand out. I think this is my main criticism of this film - that there is nothing really clear. There's nothing really terrible here, but there's nothing really fantastic either, so the viewer is left with a rather nice mummy story.
