What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made a kind of typical summer feed that could have been directed by anyone available outside the cinema school ... in fact, they probably did a better job. They could at least put half of the idea in the scary text. <br /> <br /> Mark and the tower play an astronaut who has traveled through a kind of holes and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (Except for this time), the monkeys fight through a dialogue that wakes their minds, unreasonable conspiracy and special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that it was possible to put these funds in about 10 independent films that could have been considered a "masterpiece" . <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy the wonderful talent of Tim Roth, his performance as the leader of the evil monkey Thade is nothing more than an intense form of sagging and breathing. Fortunately for him, make-up allows him as an actor to maintain some dignity and hide most of the angry dialogue behind his ears and flowers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Hollywood tradition that always depends on taking male and female leads and stabilizes in the end without any evolution of relationship or cause. And "Haha, we are very smart, right?" The way Hollywood mixes the signals from the original POTA in this one. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night at home and call some friends and hire Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman or even to a lesser extent Sleepy, and remember The days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... was not a disgrace.
