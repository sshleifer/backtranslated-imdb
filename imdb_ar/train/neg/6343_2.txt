Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the most hypothetical films I have seen recently, both of which suffer from the same problem to some extent. False false false dialogue. Nothing comes out of anyone's mouth that seems remotely acceptable. Maybe the way this film is made is the way you're supposed to feel, but it's not acceptable. And boring. I went out after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I will stick with Sleeper and Bananas to fix Woody Allen. If I come across this on a teevee, I'll flip and try to find a ring of Quincy instead.
