This is actually a very bad film. Ideology is not as abnormal as in Collins' later films. However, my main concern about the film is that it is unreasonable and bluntly blunt for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS man joining terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and you can not ask why a group of high-ranking terrorists (who became ignorant later) fell. The film begins with a very strong scene but then lags for a long time towards the big end. In general, I think those who dare to win may be an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not have a feature film. Although reasonably successful at the time, this film began with the disappearance of Collins' career, which in the 1980s made cheap or thrilling films. Unfortunately, because it is actually a versatile actor but ultimately, Martin Choe chose his roles more carefully and has a still successful career.
