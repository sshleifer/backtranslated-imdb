Everyone who watched the movie "Shine", Scott Hicks about the ultimately tragic life, of pianist David Helfgots; I'm sure I realize that "SOLOIST" is too bad compared to him. It's slow like a jest (I took five breaks to answer emails just to get up). The depiction of the homeless area extends over the summit and is very immersed in the self, equally I am afraid of filming the terrible beach battle in the atmosphere and the other disaster Attonment. John Fox's performance was a very poor example of acting and lacked the credibility of displacement. On the other hand, although he is struggling with a slow-moving film, he still manages magic, is he 9 or is he turning to George Clooney in more ways? The comparison between these two well-known "stars" is not necessary, because the brightest light in terms of representation should be the highlight of the "brilliance" of Jeffrey Rush, whose brilliant performance shone brighter in the sky. With both "Atonement" and "Soloist", the written word wins far more awards for its sympathy with the subject. Read the book and articles or wait for his DVD to be in the basement of the deal soon.
