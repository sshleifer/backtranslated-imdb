Beverly was born at the wrong time. She was an actress before her time, bringing strength and grace to some great clicks like the films she starred. In Gunslinger, she is the mayor's wife. He gets upset, so he takes up his job to hunt down his killers. It is better than the material you work with, to a large extent. The film is gray in color, supported, and mostly boring. There's some humor (unintended) with tire tracks everywhere, people running behind a building to suddenly appear in front of another building (I've heard about false fronts, but that's ridiculous!), The really stupid plot line for a newly widowed sheriff falling in love with The hired man to kill her. Even if she did not love her husband, it was like a week or two just since he died! And ended up shooting at the man to death in the end, anyway. No luck with the men, this one. <br /> <br /> The wicked piece is another woman, owner of the saloon. It plans to buy a range of land only if the railway passes and makes it rich. Her plan of action if you are not lame - you'll only steal as much as you can from the town as much as possible. Hell, she and her tenant gun are finally against the whole town. Do you tell me these people are not armed? Look at what happened in the old towns of the Old West when bank robbers came to steal the bank, and then they were killed in a barrage of bullets by armed and dangerous townspeople. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of futile talk and ride around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. The usual bleak end is in the Kurman click, though fortunately, they lack moral preaching at the end that was in the film "The World Invasion." Sheriff delivers her badge to Sam Bass and goes to sunset, although the film was so gray that she never saw the sun.
