When I took the news this morning for the first time, I thought, "Wow, finally, some entertainment." It was a little fun for a week or so ... but we have to face it, these reporters (if one can even call it) have a WAY TOO many "play time". <br /> <br /> At first, I thought Gillian was breathing out fresh air. But seriously, she did not get as little of a journalist as she did. It is not very professional. Continue interrupting Steve when he starts telling viewers a specific news story. It's so annoying that I can not see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Gillian is not a good journalist. It's hell, she's more famous like to be a celebrity. Thus, they instantly turn into celebrities about the celebrities who are supposed to be interviewed. She is not very professional, and you may see that her relationship with celebrities is more important than being a journalist who is not really satisfied, and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointing), this show contains more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government or the US or anything that will benefit and / or serve the public interest. They focus so much on excitement that everything they talk about comes as a commercial product. On the other hand, field correspondents have something interesting ... <br /> <br /> I think "Good Day LA" is for teenagers and young celebrities, and certainly not for people who really care about the news. <br /> <br /> Side note: (I'd rather watch KTLA.) However, they try to be fun sometimes, still a bit boring, well, I'll stick to NBC today, ABC Good Morning America. Also fine ... as long as Diane Sawyer is no longer very dangerous.)
