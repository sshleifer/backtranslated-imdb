Hey man, I know what your thinking is: "With an address like this, I can not make mistakes!" Uh yes you can. I also love the title, but the man who hated him was the stupid child who played the role of "Little Devil's Assistant". The mother also hated her, and her sister / daughter and boyfriend - hated all these people! Man, it was a torment watching this sometimes! The only reason not to get this 1/10 is that it takes a look at the low budget, they did "OK". But hey man did not hate those actors, you stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money just to use Halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus' costume was finally too stupid. O torment, do not see!
