There was such a hype about playing a game with Bill Schattner ... especially in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to adjust what was going on all the hype about a new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says in a crisp, nasal way, "Wow." <br /> <br /> The only thing you like about this show is the fact that you know it will end in the end. Sitting for an entire hour was like going to a dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock as you think it is at intervals of 10 minutes, just to know that only one minute has passed (but it seems like eternal) since you last looked around the clock. Why did not I change the channel? Well, perhaps for the same reason, most other people did not ... out of sheer optimism. I mean, no one really wants to * think that the show with Bill Schattner can be very good. <br /> <br /> Personally, since the first 15 minutes, I never thought that this was the type of car that showed William Shatner's talents. My main complaint was that the group was very dark. Watching it left me feeling depressed. I have continued your desire to get a little excitement, but there was nothing. There was not enough light on the group to get a sense of energy from the audience (which you could not even see). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People do not watch games to treat insomnia. ..they watch the game appear to be excited and spend a good time. Please do us all a favor and inspect this in a cellar.
