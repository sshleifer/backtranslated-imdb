I wish I could give this film zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the next day out, I came to IMDb to check the comments. Commentary called the film is predictable and cheesy with terrible dialogue. I never go to the opinions of others, so I wasted seven bucks for this wonderful movie. It had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script must be pushed to the shelf. How long have you ever seen scary movies? I swore I was surprised because there were no moments from the HUG ^ - ^ group. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. That's because I was thinking about my research paper on English. The vulgar image and birds / cat appeared from nowhere when you thought something would happen. <br /> <br /> The characters were stupid. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm clock went off and the main character said, "I have to get my mother's shawl !!!" You are. idiot. Screw shal! Safety is only a few steps away, but no, my mother's shawl (which did not match the dress by the way) is more important than your health and safety. And above all, they took her to her house, realizing that the killer knew where she lived. Allah. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also expected ENTIRE. And not only, I bet he is hiding under the bed, moments. He was, "stole the bell clothes and went out of the hotel" and "he's the informant next to the lobby, not the killer!" Moments. Movies should not be expected. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I will continue by saying, It was a terrible film. I'm glad I went to see it in the theaters, so I will not buy it for $ 15.00 and I hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing happened. If the killer had fallen after the detective had called him to fire in the same spot he had shot. Knife in hand and fall and stab the girl on his way down. Oh, how beautiful it is. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go to see a good movie.
