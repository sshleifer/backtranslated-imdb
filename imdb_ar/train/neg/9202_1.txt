I own this movie. Not by choice, I am doing. I was really bored that day, and I liked the box. So I figured out the old VCR and spent the next half hour of my life crying "Why God Why?". The story line was not so bad, I was considered such a player. I think if you're going to see romantic scenes of eccentric genius cheese you'll enjoy this movie. "I've always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know like Dr.Spock ... cant love" there are very few good things to say about this film. But if you reach a very bad movie, this is the right movie for you !!! The real story is more interesting though;) <br /> <br /> If you have to summarize this movie with one word, it will be: <br /> <br /> LAME
