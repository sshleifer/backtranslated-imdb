This film shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Certainly, the viewer is treated to many beautiful scenes in Los Angeles in the 1930s - I particularly like the view of the cart approaching the tunnel and the tram rising on the side of the hill - but in the sense that this good cinematic defeats itself because it creates a mood that "something What will happen "- and nothing happens. The script also retains deceit towards some plots, actions or shocks - and time after time is not delivered. Not even presenting a theme (I suppose) of the film, a fundamental imbalance of characters. The main actors, whether very beautiful for their roles, did not transmit any repression or suffering, and the script did not introduce us to anyone. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His personality was well designed, played perfectly, so much so that I wanted the camera to follow him.
