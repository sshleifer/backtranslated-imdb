I went to see this movie simply to see what all this noise was all about and I was very disappointed by my displeasure of getting the 6 (?) Oscars and the 7.9 rating on the IMDb as of today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow must be the most fortunate movie ever to win the best picture and best output for Oscar for this kind of really bad movies and wonder why? Was the "cowboy" story unrealistic to get rid of bombs meant anything to someone I had not seen? Why have you continued to get the mental image that this film was a new version of some of the old bad Western movies about cowboys doing "courageous" work in the wild West with "evil" red Indians; but just being assigned to a different background this time? Has she been awarded the Oscars because the former director of James Cameron, making it a nice story (chat) for television programs of the day time to enjoy it? Or was it some kind of Impair's syndrome for clothing - where most people realized it was undesirable but could not say it because others did not seem to say so loud? <br /> <br /> And finally what was with this sniper scene where they showed a shell shell falling in a high resolution mo as slow as if to convey a "deep message" or something? There's something in the lines. "ERW guys make good snipers all of a sudden and get the dirty terrorists all the time?" Have you just been the one who felt that there are lots of pieces and pieces here and there in the movie for no apparent reason? Can you get the Oscars to edit and direct? <br /> <br /> If you do not see this yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait for it to run on TV in a few years. You will not miss much.
