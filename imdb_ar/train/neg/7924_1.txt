The film "Corpse Grinders 2" is 103 minutes of film rip. The plot is a big mix of irrational business dealings between people who grind bodies to cat food while foreign cats, who are losing a fight with foreign dogs, get some of these foods. When I watched this movie, I started looking for any kind of distraction, and nothing reassured myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out. <br /> <br /> Several scenes last for a very long time, as characters take forever to do simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikkels does not like to use jump cuts often, lest they confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this position is "vanguard" or just "stupid". Try what I might do, I could not bring myself to any of the characters in the huge, unnecessary team, with the possible exception of the elderly men who patronize the plant. The vast majority of actors are a group of amateur talent who do not bother learning the words "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing it on camera. Although the blame should go to the sound quality is poor, since I have already heard about only 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> This may be the worst film ever shot. I listened to excerpts from the commentary, and Mr. Mikkels comes as an amazingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing doing this kind of garbage? I would like to hear explanations from elderly men who had to lie down without a shirt on a metal conveyor belt waiting for it to arrive. The films she has long hated are suddenly much better. I crave the appropriate Excalibur music intermittently, and the consistent lighting of the dead explosion. I need to do something, anything. Do not see this movie.
