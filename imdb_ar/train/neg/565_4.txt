The same difficulty I face with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver". Instead of the writings of the composers in the stylistic period of the play's settings, they wrote just Broadway-type melodies, which were historically non-monolithic and deviant style. <br /> <br /> Also, the blatant brutality and dramatic dramas do not mix well with some of the sunny fights that permeate the result. It is an uncomfortable mix that leaves a stinging expression for sure. <br /> <br /> The boy's pouring Oliver does not help things: a temporary greedy and very precious, there is nothing less than hardness here. Fagin performs his traditional routine sufficiently, although the tones that force her to sing have little basis in a period of time. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me," he is handed over with intense tenderness, throat and tension. The two gigantic numbers of production, "Whom you buy" and "Think of yourself" seem to have been overproduced, with everything except the kitchen sink dumped. It's something that everyone has to get out of, and there's something else to overcome. <br /> <br /> Depression, despair and corruption in much of the novel do not seem to make way for such wrestling and choreography. While the novel is classic, I must admit that I have a problem with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, as his work tends to produce a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his happy personal life, which was filled with disappointment and remorse. <br /> <br /> All of the combined talents of this production, both inside and behind the camera, can not overcome the non-constructive nature of essential materials. All of this results in an uncomfortable experience for me. <br /> <br />
