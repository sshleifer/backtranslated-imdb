I did not really know what was the subject of this film when I went to the theater to see it (the hype about the demonic etc, etc.) where the trailers in the last film I saw looked pretty interesting. <br /> <br /> My dear, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea of ​​good intimidation. Honestly, I've felt a desire to watch a really good and scary film, not some loosely painted religious farce that tries to record the cheap thrill by getting some bloody chicks every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from the spoilers! But I found it strange that the atheist, who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest, may suddenly end up suffering Christ (not supposed to be infected with phantom notions) to be I mean, they hang around with the losers, do the losing things, act like typical rebels and others, and here are the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! <br /> <br /> The scenes of her crucifixion, the throwing of the head, the screaming, and the blood everywhere, have become somewhat boring after seeing him dozens of times. It was not scary or scary, but was disgusting. However, it has become very painful to watch them - those disturbing scenes were very disturbing ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you are a Catholic, you do not see it clearly. If it is not, you still do not see it.
