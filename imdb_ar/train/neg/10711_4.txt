The client is about to ... well, customer. The devil's servant and his goal is to get the key that will open the door in which his master is locked. It is a kind of devil who possesses humans and when the body dies he will have another. Anyone who happens to possess will go in some berserk rage. Dolph Londgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret troupe of the Templars, who is charged with keeping the key away from the client. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where two of the temple's knights escape from the client. Then he went to 1999, where the key ends somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist was appointed to study / dig where the key was found. Needless to say, the client is the key, and the film becomes a long stalker scene between the client and the Lukas archeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie, is just a low-budget B-movie flick. The film lacks energy, and just along. You will follow the chase but you will never feel involved in the story that deliberately takes the ideas from previous movies (especially The Terminator). Fighting scenes with the customer is annoying, as you never feel how powerful or powerful this warrior is. The "army" becomes a "man-made army" when a band of knights is fighting but suck when it comes to another. It is supposed to be present for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is just thrown out for rest. A complete idea of ​​the secret arrangement of the knights, door to hell, and the key is not explained. We only accept that they exist only. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that there is little chance of a story but just enough to make a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren seems to wish he was somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Judgment: 2 of 5 stars.
