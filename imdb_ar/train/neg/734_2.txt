This film was crap with capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But this promise was broken soon after the viewer knew where the plot was heading. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue, Murthy, who was a creep in the original film, is easy in this film. It was clear that he was just a man wearing cheap plastic clothes. (By the way, it is believed that "Morty" is one of the most horrifying names on the planet - it is categorized directly with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to the value of horror, or why not mention only the wooden statutes Henry Fryakin-Kissinger "Running, Dr. Kissinger!" It would be scary like Morty. <br /> <br /> Then there's a scene where the "hero" sees his father's tomb as "a heavy hammer?" You might imagine - Four?

No. <br /> <br /> The film continues, and in the end many people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (somewhat). This film is real yawning. Do not hire them.
