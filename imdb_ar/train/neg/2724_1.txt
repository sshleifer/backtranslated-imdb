I would say that unlike many people who did not like this movie and found it impossible to understand that I was quite able to understand it for what it was ... a very incoherent attempt at a conspiracy line. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw this word out but in this case fits very well. The director first presents the material in a way that is "very arrogant" and worse, in a very uncoordinated way. It is inconsistent in that it presents the material in a chaotic arrangement, which makes us think that the director was so drunk that he does not remember the scenes that come in the first place, and the arrogant in that they expect us to watch for 2 hours, from that. <br /> <br /> I respect surrealism for what it is. (Creating a story about more than a real world that is not connected to real life), but there is nothing surreal about a story in modern times, modern land preparation, and most importantly it is unable to engage the public but moreover, The events that were expelled are barely interconnected. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is similar to watching a story; perhaps even a very good story because it was based on a book, but the frustration of the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and tie any means of cohesion. <br /> <br /> To compare stylistic movies. Compare Gaspar Noe in "Seul contre tous" with this. He has given us a very coherent, attractive and intellectually profound story. This film does not present any intellectual study, and although it is a great way in the split presentation, the director ultimately abandoned the basic art of telling good stories and all we have left is the chaos of events that are barely intertwined. <br /> <br /> Yes it is already possible to understand things .... to a point. But as I said earlier, the viewer will reach a stage where he simply says "who cares." It seems like watching a worldly story about a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in a non-historical order. Even with killings, it is not entirely impressive. Many people these days will give high marks to something they can not understand or understand just for fear of being an idiot, and in every way TRIES tries to make the viewer look foolish. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time on your hands, then please watch this movie, taking into account what you have said. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented more effectively and that is my basic thinking.
