I do not buy Kung Fu movies to plot. I buy them for fighting scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent combat scenes, but not vice versa. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it was moved very slowly to my taste. There were about 3 or 4 modest fighting scenes everywhere, lasting only a few minutes. The last battle was a bit longer, but at that point I felt so bored that I did not notice it.
