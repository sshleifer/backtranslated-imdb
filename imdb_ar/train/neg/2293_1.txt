If this series is supposed to be an improvement on the Batman-The Animated Series, I think I failed terribly. (Catwoman, for example, looks awful ...) But what really bothered me was that he made Batman look like a kind of gazelle who could not take care of himself in a fight, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, it's Batman, for God's sake! I know the picture books, I know it's supposed to be both Nightwing and Batgirl's allies Batman, along with Robin, but still ... making Batman say he needs help from them ... What, can not handle some punches? At BTAS, you can face dozens of opponents without any problem ... has it become big? Come on ... <br /> <br /> Another thing: I do not really think that Batman will allow a kid like Tim Drake to go to battle soon, without years of hard training. First, he is irresponsible (Batman is everything, but he is irresponsible), and the second is not what happened in comedy, if we are to remain loyal to them. <br /> <br /> Making Batman - a cartoon series of history, with animation, stories and characters ... That was really Batman legend. A new adventure series has transformed the legend into another Batman flick.
