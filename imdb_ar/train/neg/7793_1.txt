This is really one of the worst movies ever. I consider myself a fan of a zombie film and often tolerate bad behavior, "special effects," a stupid story, and anything you might encounter in second-rate movies, like a good story / story or comment. This one basically has no positive side to him and is the third or fourth rate, probably the worst. Some of my friends and I made a small film during a week-long vacation and certainly did a better job (no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This click is not funny and does not talk about anything else. The really bad and repetitive special effects, zombies that look like ordinary people (with the exception of the extra white skin drawn on their faces), a way of detecting fake blood (I like realism a lot, combining realism with zombie movies is debatable. The camera stays for a long time with feeding scenes. It's boring and you can not help but wonder why zombies use weapons to kill their prey. I will not go into the details of the dubbing (others did). Although I am from Germany and am interested in at least the original version, I will not waste my time more with this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from him as much as you can.
