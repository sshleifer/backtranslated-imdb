I went to see this film with a crowd composed mostly of the new "spiritual" types, which, unlike me quite, enjoyed this movie very much --- despite those who knew the book too (there seems to be a book that contains more nonsense ), The film is not quite good. So, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual," be at least able to tolerate things like "halo" and "stellar body," and do not mind the frequent use of the term "energy" out of context for physics or technology, Movie, and you're likely to enjoy a book that seems to be based on it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are in constant touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief has been easily exhausted by the nonsense of the new age conspiracies and conspiracies, if in addition you have low tolerance with effects Cheesy lighting to indicate the occurrence of spirituality, and perhaps even expect a reasonable non-wood dialogue, then this my recommendation to you regarding this film: stay. Away. <br /> <br /> Do not think about it. Tonight, this film has displaced the fortified towers and dragons as the worst film I've ever seen in a movie theater (I do not count the movies I've seen with bad expectations, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, the major group of films that came out of it has been uploaded to two films (D & D, too). I do not take out movies, not even this film, but I must do that when I first saw visual photography of the light, because the new age of BS continues to become thicker and thicker from that point onwards. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of people who share some of the old prophecies in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and aim to bring humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They speak in fact that these spiritual things are the next step in human development, which should make anyone even has the weakest idea of ​​human evolution. The film is full of knives like that. Sometimes people move on to what they certainly call "another dimension," or perhaps "another plane," to become invisible around them who have not yet reached the age of enlightenment. The good. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director takes care of the audience by presenting the "visions" that make up the prophecy, painfully slow, and we are supposed to be able to save them and leave the cinema as better and more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some of the beautiful nature shots, and some of the supporting performances presented by Elizondo and De Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that it seriously affects my ability to take someone seriously if they consider this film interesting or acceptable. It is really the most naive kind of spirituality, and unless this is your thing, it is better to do something else your time and money.
