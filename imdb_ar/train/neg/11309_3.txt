A bad plot (although it's good for B movie), good fast fight scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But there's something that always bothered me about this movie: How did Mariska Hargitay never talk? In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in the garden. However, in the normal version (video), most of the scenes are disconnected and never speak. This bothers me because it not only takes a feminine (though vulgar) view of the film, but makes the last shot look creepy. It would have been better if they had kept watching, because in those scenes at least she had a personality, a character that hid everything Speakman was saying.
