This review also contains a spoiler for the first movie - so if you do not see any of the movies you want but do not want spoilers, please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> While this is supposed to be the film about the meeting of Christian and Catherine for the first time, the film is a bad version of the first cruel intentions. The actors who filmed Christian Ryan Philip and Catherine Sarah Michelle Gilar are already very bad alternatives. Neither of them can avoid the harmful and alienating attitudes of the original actors. It is very shocking that some dialogue was literally - not much between Christian and Catherine, but if you listen closely enough you will recognize it. There are also contradictions in the plot - if this is really the first meeting of Christians and Catherine, what is the reason that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the film? It is assumed that he was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original film (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Also, the association with photography / "may be a model" in the end was completely lame and did not add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe they made harsh intentions 3.
