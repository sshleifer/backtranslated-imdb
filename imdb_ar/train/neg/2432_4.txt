Not much to say about this. Plot you can link them pretty much, in the first ten minutes. Nothing too wrong with this film, very little work for action film. There was an opportunity to explore the feelings of the characters from time to time. Whether the motion film is the right kind to do this, I'm still not hesitant. Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without paying full attention to her, as she had a few transitions and a clear plot. Maybe you're guilty of it, so it might be better to watch again or unintentionally. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but my best is 4 out of 10)
