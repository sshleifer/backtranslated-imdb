After a lot of bad memories, I used to skip this episode every time they appear in the second season sequence. I've seen it again just recently to remind me why. This has always been considered the worst episode of ST: TNG (except for "Shades of Gray", which is hardly a ring at all). <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the lively dialogue and reflection of the red text by the author of Writing 101: "Show, Do not Tell!" From the pronunciation of Deanna Troi, and remind everyone of the constant reminder of what a charming and dangerous Okona, Guinan to explain about how funny its droid is to, who cares about the conflict, there is no solution it is a plot point is not highlighted and marked three times for our declaration, There is a believable moment in any of them. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is a very small dog and can not be considered the center of conspiracy machinations. On the other hand, it may be impossible for John Paruman (Jack Harkins of "Dr. Ho") to withdraw this subscribed deputy for his role. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, to the subplot.While I think Joe Piscopo stopped funny for decades, he had nothing with Brent Spiner doing it here.) Although Jerry Lewis bit was stupidly fun .) <br /> <br /> A good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little tribute to a ring less than the original series. I prefer moving to the Time Box or Q Who.
