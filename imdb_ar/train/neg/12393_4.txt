When I got this free movie from my job, along with three other similar movies .. I watched it with very low expectations. Now this film is not bad in itself. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, all you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood movie, but for cheap thrills, it's not so bad. Maybe I will not watch this movie again. In short, this is the kind of film you might see very late at night on a local TV station that just wants to take some time, or you'll see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local TV station trying to take some time. Despite misconduct, vulgar lines and sub-cameras work. I did not want to turn off the movie and pretend it was unprecedented in the DVD player. The story has been accomplished several times in many films. This is neither different nor better nor worse. <br /> <br /> Just an average movie.
