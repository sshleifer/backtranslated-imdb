Just what I need, another film about England in the 19th century. Much like the regular England, just a football field that nobody does. In this wonderful place of lords, ladies and other random titles, Charlotte Ginsburg wanders aimlessly like Jane Eyre, from a novel that no one has ever read willingly in Mr.Rochester's bed, where she tries to teach a French girl to look at the blank blackboard Time. One day, Mr.Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but his wife's issue of fruit is still restricted in the attic. Oops, it was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some of them were carefully spreading the fire (maybe they hired the group), the film finally came. Everything seemed really authentic, that's something I think. But again, Nah.
