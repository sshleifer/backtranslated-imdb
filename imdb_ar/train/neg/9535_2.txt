Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the third number. It's slower, acting worse, and the story is too weak. It is not good to say about this film. So the scenes of fighting are more boring than number three, and I thought that was impossible. It is very slow for 90 minutes. Painful, in fact. I stumbled into it, hoping to get better. If you really want to watch this movie, you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find (to buy, that is) maybe for good reason. Like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. It is the same in the name only. Anyway, the most I can give the best of the best: without notice is 2/10
