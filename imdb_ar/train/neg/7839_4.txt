Serge Varnell presented a very precise critique of this film in the magazine "Rwandan Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). <br /> <br /> Critics explain how France was behind the entire United Nations situation in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The United Nations soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while the genocide was warmly welcomed by the French soldiers. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten United Nations soldiers were killed by the genocidal forces. Genocide forces. <br /> <br /> For this reason, UN soldiers decided to protect their lives by driving behind French trucks. <br /> <br /> By doing so, they have given up the unforgivable Tutsi of course. <br /> <br /> But it must be borne in mind that French soldiers have organized this situation.
