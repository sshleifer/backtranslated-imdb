The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are good: you see real mess on the set, a product on the verge of collapse, it was great director (Mickey Rourke), bad mood star, etc. I've seen everything before, but it's good. but after that! The rest of the time the movie repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good behavior, no bad behavior, it goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has a couple of minutes when his character talks about his career in a scene where reality and fantasy meet. In general, this makes 12 minutes good. <br /> <br />
