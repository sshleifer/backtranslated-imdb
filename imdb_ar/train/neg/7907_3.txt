Excellent performance by Alex Elias highlights the pile of misunderstanding and confusion otherwise. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with each run, I find fun less and less. Why Munchies are so lusty? Have I already explained that? Are they a reflection of our "savage" brutality? If so, why not make it more obvious? Why not just retrieve the touch of precision that plagued this film, and make this contact clear? Another part of this film that bothers me endlessly - motorcycles. The jacket worn by the little beast on the front cover seems to refer to a "wise" traveler. Sun glasses say, "You're a wonderful friend." With all this, I'm ready to meet Easy Rider with the Muppets game. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins Series If you love small puppets, wise crackers, and reptiles - they'll give you the treatment you deserve.
