I felt very disgusted by this film, and felt compelled to warn others. This film has no story, plot or purpose hint. The film begins with the screening of the movie "Let's be scary" standard, which he is now familiar with. So we can completely ignore the beginning. Soon we met the main actress, and from this point it becomes clear to everyone that you have just wasted your hard earned and will be better off watching a constant. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) acting is a melancholy and they must all return to Pantomime to travel from where they came from. Having said that, even the best actors in the world will struggle to make this movie seen remotely. Their poor performance contributes to disaster. The meaningless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of another eccentric writer, who may consider himself an artist, has led to a film that tests your patience. That was not the case until my colleague, the observer, told me, "We were watching this for 45 minutes." Did you realize that this film is thin and tasteless like a cup of tea without a tea bag? Obviously there was something missing and unfortunately the audience was not. Instead of suggesting what is missing, let me tell you what it is: Dumb Blonde, the victim, a bad guy, about two minutes of the story spanning hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl looks a bit indecent in some scenes, but expects to want to see her face torn to the rest of the movie!
