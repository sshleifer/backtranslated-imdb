- A film crew shoots a horror film in an old house where he is said to have been cursed, where seven people have mysteriously died over the years. One crew member finds an ancient book of curses and seems to be perfect for use in some ritual scenes in their film. It is logical that the book's writers are better than the text they use. But when you read the book, the cemetery outside suddenly comes to life. Now the crew and staff face real danger. <br /> <br /> IMDb lists a 90-minute running time. For the first 60 minutes, nothing happens. Spend a lot of time on film within a movie. Are we supposed to be afraid of the horror film they're shooting? We already know that their film is not "real". These concerns do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things you can enjoy around The House of Seven Corpses. Representation is terrible. Most of these "actors" will have difficulty playing in primary school. The result is terrible. It reminds us of a television series in the seventies and does not provide any atmosphere. Talk about the atmosphere, except for a few moments at the end of the film, there is nothing to talk about. The logic of the character is all but nonexistent. Even in the film, you expect characters to act in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember a single scene in which the character chose the most illogical ways available to her. Finally, there is the first 60 minutes of the film you have already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /> <br /> I have not rated "The House of Seven Corpses" at least because of the situations in which the film actually works (perhaps by accident). My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The title sequence shows the death of the previous seven owners and may be the highlight of the film. The final scenes on the massive staircase where the zombie threatens the film crew will be fairly effective (what a ringing endorsement). In general, these moments are not enough to make this movie good.
