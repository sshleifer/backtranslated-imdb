This movie was not terrible but it was not very good. I am a big fan of Toni Collette and I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, a writer who gets a book from a 14-year-old boy. The book is wonderful and does not think a child wrote it. Tony Collett plays the role of guardian of children you do not know if this child already exists or if everything is fine. I will not spoil the film but I will say that this film is not scary. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good and Tony Collett's performance was superb in addition to Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The movie was a big disappointment in my opinion that I was waiting for his arrival on DVD.
