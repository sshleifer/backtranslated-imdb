I was expecting the film to be like any admirer of the Broadway theater. I waited and read reviews for months about the award-winning offers. I mean strongly star Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... The film can not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? Error! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the noise it received, and the only preserved graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> The performance of Eddie Murphy James Brownesk saves the movie when it is introduced threatens the multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's attention every time it appears on the screen. Her performance "I'm telling you" was the only time she felt that the noise was worth it. She objected because she begged her there was no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have said, it steals the film from the most experienced actors and deserves all the appreciation it has received for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, are performing. Foxx's acting skills seemed to precede his exceptional "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles filmed an extended photo or video recording, making her shine through the film. Her performance was not strong enough to make you care about her character at any time in the film. <br /> <br /> The film was very short, 30 minutes and one song (individually "Beyonce's heartfelt" by Jamie Foxx) is too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
