This movie is really clumsy! I saw it at the age of 11 years, and even then I thought it was ridiculous! I would recommend this film only to children under the age of 12. I did not really care about him, but I think he answers some good questions that children need to know, such as: 1) Do you buy happiness money? 2) Should I lie to my parents about things I think they will not agree with? 3) Does money buy friendships? 4) Is money all about it? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? Admittedly, these attitudes are not very realistic, but I think that if parents discuss these problems with their children, they may also have to watch this video, to show / intimidate their children who are lying and may have the power to hurt you.
