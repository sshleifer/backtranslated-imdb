Well, I must say that this is probably the worst film I have seen this year! The jokes were very strange (you would not expect from PG) (rated PG in Canada) and it was not funny! With this wonderful film, I was at least expecting some good acting but I did not understand it. I'm a fan of Breen Wilson, and this is the first time I'm very disappointed by his performance. No characters Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman is the least loved thing and I was really less interested in what happened to either. I did not expect this at all as in the past, I really liked other films for this director (six days, seven nights for example). I guarantee you will be like me begging until this movie ends.
