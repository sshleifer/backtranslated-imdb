There are no spoilers here, but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead, but the last series, only 3 of which are so far, is very bad. Stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I found this 3 in the last jaw series ridiculous ridicule. As a BBC licensee, after the show, I contacted BBC complaints to pass my disappointment. I am surprised that the actors of the caliber Trevor Eve and Sue Johnston did not object to the lines of the story. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surely they can see that they lost all direction. It's a good job, it's the last string or the next string may start with the team that is investigating the death of Father Christmas! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
