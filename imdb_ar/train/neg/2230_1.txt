If you want to see a gay expert of retarded karate beats a group of Mexican gangs hard again and again for an hour, then this is the movie for you. If not, then choose another DVD from the 20c container, which is the only place that this movie belongs to. The acting was so terrible that I had to force myself to watch it to the end. The cover makes her look very cool, but her gangster movie is very cheap and the other is rated B along 2 grams and the main street is obsessed and dangerous. I will not buy or rent this film unless you plan to stoning, drawing, editing and disposing of you do not really care. It's really the worst film in human history !!!
