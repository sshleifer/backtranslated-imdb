Well, I rented this movie and discovered that it really sucks. She talks about that family with the father's wife and the stupid fights in the family. Then the nice son comes with his stupid camera and likes to take a picture of the damaged building and strange things and a strange film. Then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agree. They go to that city that no one knows exists (Blah blah blah) and the most disturbing thing is that the movie ends, but you do not understand what the movie is !! I have seen many mystery films but this was the worst, honestly I have no description at all and I hope I do not see it.
