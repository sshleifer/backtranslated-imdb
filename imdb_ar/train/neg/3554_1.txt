I rented this again in the 1980s and frankly I can not remember anything specific about the film - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of those films that were "very evil, they leave you with bad feelings." It was not even one of those "What the heck was that?" Movies. I can not remember the actors' performance, but it was badly filmed, the story was broken, and it had no specific style. When it ended, I was angry that I wasted time. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies that I did not understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and / or storytelling, but it was clear that those films had some of those characteristics. The incubator does not contain anything. <br /> <br /> I've already thought about not commenting on this "widget" for fear someone will watch it out of curiosity, but I have to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this movie.
