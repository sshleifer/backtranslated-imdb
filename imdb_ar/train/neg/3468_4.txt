A second-rate female filmmaker (a famous singer MOLLY RINGWALD!) Was designed to complete the horror film that his mother (Kylie Minogue was so terrified) tried to make 12 years ago. It is an intriguing plot option to say the least, as any Australian horror lover knows that this type of woman unfortunately lacks output. The movie contains a curse, because Molly had to kill a murderer myself on the original group. But she returned, because she needed exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are starting to die on the "set". Cut is an Australian attempt to "slasher" modern, but unfortunately do not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, half the film Wes Craven was torn in the 1990s. Many of the names in the movie world fall to the movie "Scream" (except for the name of Australian projection - Jane Campion ... see how this is not funny) and a lot of "Is this real or is this a" no "new nightmare. The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, everything is almost bad about it. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: At some point, a good-looking filmmaker tells the owner of the house he envisions: "Do not worry, we will treat your house as if it were our own," which responds to it. I mean anything to me, you seem to live in a landfill! "Ha! Molly was one ridiculously enough one to regret not renting this one. "Have you got any charcoal diet here?" (While riding in a movie professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?" (The first thing that shines on the group) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Oh, that's what I was thinking about.)
