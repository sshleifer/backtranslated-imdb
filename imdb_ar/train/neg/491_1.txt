As others have noted, this film is not criminally accurate in its portrayal of the artist's life, and it has been deeply disturbed and disturbed ... because of its transformation into rape into a tragic love affair because of the fact that its rapist was responsible for "awakening her talent" In the way you turned her into a sexual object, you get the idea. Also, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi will see this movie and walk with this kind of impression.
