--- What happened to these unwanted people. Alan Arkin, as usual, was wrong and walked in this role. Children are all in a mess. Marissa Tome may wish that this role is on its way. What does Karl Rainer and Rita Moreno do in this really bad film? If you enjoy watching the losers rise on their holidays and do not try to do anything better, this is your film. All others, or walk, read a book, or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
