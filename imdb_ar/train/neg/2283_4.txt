Oscar's best-selling classic horror film goes on - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name must be mentioned with the same horror as Karlov, Lugosi and Bryce, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of the reasons why I watched this film. Dwight gave this thing somewhat more than just a little inconvenient little scary behavior after creeping that led you to hope to get the bigger role of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. When I am in the medical profession myself, I must pay tribute to the expert performance of pathetic endocrine insufficiency. Although the other "medical errors" gave a short chuckle, especially when the good doctor tried his fellow doctors ... "He continued to give it to her." Unfortunately, these two major shows were unable to keep us awake through 3 attempts to sit down This possibility is a slow film. The plot is predictable with little minor transformations. The shooting while grabbing legitimate atmosphere was more productive bright in making me yawn - yes, you can use a lot of shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - I watched this one time to watch Frye and Iborn - but only when I wake up on a large scale and with lots of caffeine.
