This is one of the worst films I have ever seen It is very boring with lots of boring dialogue and has some very disturbing characters and a funny-looking creature. The only reason I saw this piece of garbage was that it was in the 8-pack horror pack. The plot is a joke and completely stupid as it is final. No blood except for a few bloody marks on the creature, and two gunshot wounds. Representation is terrible !!. Richard Cardela is terrible like a sheriff and was very funny in addition to his annoying character. Glenn Roberts is a comic satisfaction and was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is very annoying and was also funny! Bob Hayman is decent but not much more. Richard Garrison is annoying and has no chemistry with Cassie Cobb. Kacey Cobb is well here and has no chemistry with Richard. Generally avoid this piece of trash at all costs! Bomb of 5.
