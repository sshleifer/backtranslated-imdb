This is the first horror film I've seen and after I think about Im almost, you do not need to see any of the others. I was told it was a "horror film for a man of thinking" and I have to say that if it was supposed to make me think I was closed to think about the form of squirting / juggling films in the group. Do not get me wrong, even the film in this film is not worth sitting. <br /> <br /> The plot has been very heavily laundered using lots of arts for the arts. Camera effects and music are misplaced most of the time and ordinary characters are mildly said. It seems that many characters and scenes are worthless in the end when they begin to uncover some hooks for "The Hamiltons". I discovered who Lenny was in half an hour when she discovered the film. I was very visually under the confusion and confusion by Lenny revealed that I felt completely disturbed. I expected what I got, but it was possible to go much further, in fact, every bull would fall completely. With films such as "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to be a bit better for a film that is "very graphic or disturbing to the public."
