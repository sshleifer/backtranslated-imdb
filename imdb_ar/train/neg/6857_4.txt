This "brilliant comedy" seems too compelling. In fact, TRY actors are trying very hard to make a text that is basically unclear. As a result, it does not go anywhere. The idea of ​​finding a woman that she is pregnant after getting a quick divorce is not just a funny idea. And then, when Cooper sneaks with the baby because he does not want to be put up for adoption, it seems terribly unusual and drives him hard to turn this into a comedy. It's really sad, too, because the actors were more able than the text and I found myself bored with the whole mess. Since Cooper has made a lot of good comedies, I would recommend seeing them instead.
