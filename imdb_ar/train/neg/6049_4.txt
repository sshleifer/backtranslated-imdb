First, anyone thinking of this sequel to "The French Connection" by William Friedkin, is definitely a very crazy or a fool or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that it is a sequel to a great film, making it always objectively difficult, and (b) directed by John Frankenheimer, one of the best American directors of all time, so I wanted to admire. William Friedkind was the ideal person who directed a film about drug trafficking in the decaying city of New York because of his documentary documentary style of motion and stories. Frankenheimer is one of the most elegant directors of all time, the "Manchuria" candidate and "the second" This connection, which Frankenheimer chose to direct the sequel by Jane Hackman himself, tells a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original film, too. Work with him again, and he knows It also shows that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who made the film and the story was wonderful. The rest of the film does not guarantee a sorry low point in Frankheimer's film.
