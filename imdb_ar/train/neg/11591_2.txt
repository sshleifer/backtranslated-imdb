This movie is so bad that I felt nauseous when I saw it. Until this point, other premiums had at least one good thing. The 1 part was suspicious and glamorous. Part 2 was off beat and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part IV had great music, good special effects, and a new entertaining Freddie Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a much nicer blonde, returned from Part 4 with her boyfriend Dan. In parts, this supposed part of Elm Street turns into a day soap. The newer characters look harsh, and Alice Alice even has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to have come out completely. It looks tired, and does not seem awful. It seems that his predecessors do not exist and different, as as in Part 4 may be very funny. The story of Leslie Pohim never starts, and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is very bad, making my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this film is silly and unrealistic. It's very confusing and very stupid. Avoid Part 5 at any price!
