I rented this film believing it was a sad 1959 version that I saw as a child. has not been. So I was very disappointed about what I felt as a marginal action, a weak personality development and, most of all, a lack of relationship between the boy and the dog. In this release ... "Dog of Flanders" is just a nice "side" of the film. Get a 1959 copy!
