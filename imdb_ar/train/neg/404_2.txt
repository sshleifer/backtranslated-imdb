Shortly after watching this film, she questioned the mental competence of each actor and actress accepted a role. Elizabeth Shwe is a laudable actress. Why did you embrace this excessive opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due. Some of the moments in the film were unpredictable, but somewhat altered, but barely offsetting the biting tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastien Caen. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, who has any form of self esteem to count.
