Now what's wrong with the actors involved in this nonsense? Michael Dorn must stick to Star Trek. John Dell, does anyone remember him in Miami? I loved it there ... well, whatever - what can one expect from a movie with a lifeguard from a baywatch in the foreground? Nothing, that's what we got. None of the characters are grainy, and the special effects are fun (but not funny). The story is a joke (very bad). There is no logic at all to what is happening. I felt that the filmmakers were trying somewhat of the kind of "deadly tomato attack". Especially in the scene where all important people discuss national security in a closet of the kind ... <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, switch channels - your TV will be very grateful.
