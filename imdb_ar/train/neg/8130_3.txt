While exploring some of the caves with his wife, the doctor bites through the bat which causes some annoying side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes the creepy atmosphere and some decent make-up effects (though in use) Horror flick about being a sub-story of a man becoming a creature. The Pat family, known as "People's Life at Night," is suffering from its meaningless and poorly planned story. The plot does not seem to go anywhere much and the film never gives an explanation of what is happening, or even a satisfying result for all of that. The actors are fairly modest in their performance. <br /> <br /> However, I give the film some points for its lamentable art and beautiful shooting sites. The makeup work done by the late Stan Winston is very good, but he does not get much work here. A missed opportunity certainly. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the least human beings is shattering there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
