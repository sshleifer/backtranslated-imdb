I have already retired from Asian horror movies some time ago after being completely fed up with seeing a trivial ghost story. However, I have failed to exploit more and more recently, so I decided to give them another chance. My first contact port was highly directed by Takashi Miki. I have already seen Audition, and although I did not like it much, I appreciate it as one of the best modern Asian horror movies. So, I went to this with reasonable expectations; unfortunately, I found boredom only. I assume that this film is actually really clever and went above my head, but what seemed to me was just a bunch of violent and hateful scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparisons of the work of Louis Bonwell and David Lynch blasphemy as far as I am concerned; all that Miike did here is the film industry; no intelligence was carried around by humming fans, desperate to find a kind of meaning. He began my frenzy in about 10 minutes (after the father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and did not calm down until the film ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seemed. Do not be wrong, I'm not against violence in movies, and in fact actively looking for the most famous movies, but although this may be violent, it is useless and boring and I did not get one ounce of pleasure. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; I certainly hope that this is the last time I've ever called one of his films.
