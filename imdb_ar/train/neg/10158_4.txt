I could only think behind the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (a very wonderful film) when I see this because of the real sense of it as well as the great innovative idea. This can be a wonderful movie. Acting ... from some fine actors. Of others ... It is absolutely appalling. <br /> <br /> Apart from the wonderful idea and wonderful coordination. The story is also good, although often suffering from big blows to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> Is this true? It's a horror movie anyway. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this again ... I really want to have a wonderful movie that wants to be. <br /> <br /> (You can not really hear the minds behind this film) that's clearly based on a shoe chain budget. The FX really hurts the film overall. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. ... if you want to replace some of the best and best foreign exchange behaviors. <br /> <br /> Everyone who writes must continue, a great idea here.
