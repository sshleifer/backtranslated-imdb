This is not a comment on the actual film, but on the RUSCICO DVD version of North America. I do not know if there are different versions and updates, but the discs we rented were copyrighted in 2000, if that meant anything. Anyway, blending the audio on these DVDs was very awful. The levels are often top and bottom; when the scene is limited to the battlefield panorama, the orchestra track was so loud that I did not know who would explode first - the eardrum or speakers. When the dialogue time comes, the volume usually drops to something barely audible. From time to time, the Orchestra and WorldWorld will remain loud while the dialog box is overlaid at a much lower level. My wife and I found that the only way we could ever watch this movie from these DVDs was to keep one of us on the remote control to continuously adjust the volume. As another user already commented, when we chose the English voice, the dialogue continued to switch between Russian and English. Sometimes when people speak French on the original track, dubbing is in Russian, so you do not know anything. In the end, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you get over $ 50 for this DVD movie on your own library, I warmly recommend getting a rented copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic dust when you're overburdened with this bad sound, especially if you've never read the book and really want to Understand the story.
