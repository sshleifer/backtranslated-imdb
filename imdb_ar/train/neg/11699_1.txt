Thinner plot certainly thin. And the total. Obese lawyer driving a gypsy woman, the gypsy's curse caused him to lose weight and lose weight ... even bone. Well, gypsy curses should be amusing, but weight loss has become bad? Both. Except Stephen King thinks so. Michael McDowell, another horror author and screenwriter of this deep film, does the same. The lawyer is not only criminally liable, he is too fat, haha! Thinner like a piece of immature crap for someone who complains how he / she has not seen anything disgusting by obesity. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
