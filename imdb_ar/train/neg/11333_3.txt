This film is just crap. Although board members claim to be part of the oi culture, it is still a very bad initial appearance for the director. The subject itself is very interesting and I accept the bad behavior because of the fact that they are all amateur and have never acted before, but the worst thing in this film is dialogues and guidance is very tried and naive. There is no timing at all in this film. I felt that the directors were very excited to do this film (it was their first film), so they did not really ask themselves, what story they want to narrate. I met Ben (a manager) on several occasions as a nice and thoughtful young man, but that does not make him a way out. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but in a way he managed to convey a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, and does not tell anything new or provocative (and this is the sad thing in this film) it is far from any Oi! - fact. <br /> <br /> If you want to see western movies but wonderful , Watch the films of Michael Hannicke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oscar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbegel: <br /> <br /> Video Funny Games Funny Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill .. <br /> <br> /> *** out of ten, because of photography subject
