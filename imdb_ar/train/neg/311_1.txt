I just finished watching the Going Overboard. I must say that we must send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I've even tried to get blind women to watch this and stopped it in like 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? For writing, if that's what you want to call it, you must force the officials to watch this movie forever in hell !! I think somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were less. Did Wallmart get a good deal with this? Each store has a large huge box of these craps sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it with a friend, but then you may not be your friend anymore !!
