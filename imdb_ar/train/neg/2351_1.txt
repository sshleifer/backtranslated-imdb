I have no idea how anyone can stay awake during this show. It was the representation of ham and amateurs, the story was an old story, and the twist of the plot (or lack thereof) was always languidly sagging less than halfway through each episode. That's all you can say about it, because it really lacks any kind of material. <br /> <br /> How do you like people like this crap? It's stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it even more ... it seems as though some of you will stare carelessly at such interest just because you like the way some actors look, or because, for any crazy reason, you do not feel bored. " Dozens of performances a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just .. forgot it.This show sucked, thankfully it went forever.I wish they had worked on the OC demolition once and for all.
