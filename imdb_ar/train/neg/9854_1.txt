This documentary (or I should say Mukuretori) is an ideal example of how absurd people are, when they have full enthusiasm for something like this. Frankly, I hate Cryptozoology. It is a conscience, it is just its destruction. However, there was something positive in that visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information contained in this induction text was completely false, and this is really disappointing because it came from scientists, which is why it is worth 10 and not 0 An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: True, according to the chemist, hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to produce it in such proportions, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what actually happens in the stomach of the dragon. There are a lot of substances that contain hydrogen in nature but it is not necessary loud like an animal to fly, and hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so it is impossible. In any case, there is actually something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is more difficult to find than gold, and I can not explain to myself how the dragon survives depending on it. It is ridiculous, it offers dragons like creatures with low chances of overcoming the planet, but this at least explains why they are extinct. Cryptologists may call it scientists themselves, but they are not. People like them say lies as in this irony, and worse that some people buy them. But I do not think the person who cares about science will believe in the dragon after watching it. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
