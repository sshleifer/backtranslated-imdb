Or maybe that's what you feel. Anyway, the "bat people" flat like the carpet, cute like a bag of flour and sexy like a rock ... and smart like the three combined. <br /> <br /> Well, plan in short (a suitable bowl, that ...): The doctor bites the bats while testing a cave with his wife (MacDraw) and later turns into a racket - well, not exactly a racket but a racket like A creature that looks like a werewolf who kills its victims in the camera's perspective from the perspective of the first person .... <br /> <br /> But then there is a decent work (Pataki), which is about the worst kind of sheriff: Heck type. He hates people, hates married women, steals sanitary wipes (FIEND!), Smokes with a cigarette holder in his mouth and speaks at the same time, making him sound and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" (this is the worst part) ) ... He is the most important character in the entire film! <br /> <br /> The entire movie, however, is just a TV movie similar to the week crapola (Guano, in this case). It's AIP, to shout out loud! What do you expect, things of the caliber of Oscar? <br /> <br /> And what can you say about a movie that MST3K can not save? <br /> <br /> What about ... No Stars for "The Bat People", full version or version of MST3K! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there is a sequel to this movie, I'm burying my TV.
