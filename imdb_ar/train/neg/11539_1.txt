This is the biggest load of crap I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated a big movie was watching 28 Days Later and Magnolia. There is no point at all for this film, except for seeing some really sick sex / rape scenes, and Gillian Anderson relaxing herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialogue has to use the word "F" at least several times. It has very cheap representation and very low budget. I and my friend eventually stopped the film after about half an hour. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this rough. Do not see it !!!
