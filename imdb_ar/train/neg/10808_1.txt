I got a copy of Kazam on my eighth birthday, and people always say that book versions are always better than the movie, but this time it was wrong. At least with the film ending soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, and I was expecting him from a movie with a chunk that plays the magic rap mare that comes out of an old ghetto megaphone (there was probably a good reason he was trapped there). The child in the movie who plays Max is a terrible and wonderful actor. He was bullied by neighborhood children, something I do not blame because he is a little sodden bag. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and very vulgar. About a boy whose father always works and who does not find a new friend around him who makes his life better and in the end helps him to reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at age 8, I thought this was a stupid idea. It is a surprise to any of the people who worked in this film had careers after the wings because it is embarrassing and must never be done. I can walk around more about how this film suck, but you should already know just by reading the plot.
