The only reason worth the "The Norliss Tapes" worth any stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Unlike seeing Angie Baby in the "Police Police" view before, there is nothing else worth watching here. <br /> <br /> Summary: <br /> <br /> *** MINO SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is used to write a book about the Ripper. One day, he mysteriously disappears after telephoning the publisher, and points out that he stumbled upon something he had put in mortal danger. It seems that the entire series on which this poor pilot was written was a series of snapshots of the past through "Norris tapes" - a collection of audio tapes recorded by the author during the investigation of the supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the experimental episode, a wealthy sculptor died - but not before the purchase of the old Egyptian scarlet ring from a local clown doctor confirming that the Pope would give him immortality after death. We soon discover the ring itself does not give immortality. Instead, it only works to restore the body of the sculptor, allowing him to escape from his cirrhosis so that he can wander around the city to drain beautiful girls from all their blood. <br /> <br /> ARRRGHHHHHH You have not heard since the last time you saw Scooby Doo cartoon, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes, and through one of her mutual acquaintances, she communicates with Norlies to get his help in solving the mystery of her late husband's strange appearance in her possession. <br /> <br /> Is this guy a vampire? No, there is no vampire in this story despite what you might read or hear. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he brings them together. What? I do not know we only see him attacking, never gathering. why? To accomplish the second part of his attempt to immortality. It turned out that the restored sculptor would not be allowed to live forever unless he built a living-size statue of a demon named Sargoth from a combination of clay and human blood. Once it is over, Sargoth intends to inhabit the statue and use it as a gate in our world. <br /> <br /> Final analysis: <br /> <br /> "Norliss Bars" was not selected as a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see from my conclusion, the story is a trivial chaos and misrepresentation. Representation and dialogue are not better. This is not a contest for the award "Too bad it's good". Sometimes bad is bad only. <br /> <br /> After years of hearing the underground tones about the great benefits of The Norliss Tapes, I was very excited to find them on Fox Movie on 10/15/03. I wish I had not prepared the fall. <br /> <br /> After checking this photographer for the first time in two days, I can only assume that any applause I have heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who review the show based on faint memories and young nostalgia. Or perhaps they are just loyal admirers of Dan Curtis. In both cases, they have presented you with misleading reviews of "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
