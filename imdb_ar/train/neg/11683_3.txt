There were three "story lines" and "not enough to tie them together", an "inner man" very stiff and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Although his moments, the film began to appear as a quick film quickly postponed to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between the highest levels and bottoms, and barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his role very well with a full understanding of his human side and not just a typical "super detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen has performed well through part of his duplicity as "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (both were not the same in the past). In general, everyone created a great subdomain. However, when the parts finally met and everything was calculated, there was no "ah ha!" Surprise. Or summarize everything. I ended up with all the little energy I started out, with lots of plot holes and tons of questions, and as I said earlier, there's nowhere near the normal level of Spike Lee. I must completely disagree with the alleged "professional critics" ... this is not the film they are doing.
