Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is an over-designed and elegant product. It is certainly one of the most elegant movies, but when it comes to content, even the fans will reject this film. why? The film script is amateur as a 2 year old child. The script is proprietary, without good text even the greatest director ever can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production labels "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars in which it appears. But nothing can save you on Earth if you are a manuscript. Cheers! <br /> <br /> Performers: Anil Kapoor, veteran actor. But how can he play such a role? Akshay Kumar is a wonderful actor, in fact he is the only sincere grace. Kareena Kapoor was never warm. It looks amazing and leaves you, it all stands. Saif Ali Khan does not get his dues here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Fawa and Yashbal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" is a boring film. Movies at the box office failed, you should keep away.
