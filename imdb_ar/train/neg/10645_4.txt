I did not watch Tarzan before, so when I saw him on television I thought I would give him a chance. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and was somewhat overweight. Not how I imagined Tarzan would look. And what I did not miss while making myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never cried out in his traditional war cries. There was no Tarzan swinging among the trees - jumping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Well, a lot of expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - the Chita monkey was there. There was some guy with a guitar there. There were bad guys, good people and romance ... everything was very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but nothing good both. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie featuring Tarzan: 4/10
