Shame on the films Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra who seem to have lost their intelligence over the years and provide steady fare in this piece of film that does not deserve the standards of You Tube. I dropped my teeth throughout the flick beginning to finish the direction of schizophrenia, the line of conspiracy that never materialized and in the last scene I felt ashamed that my makers and crorepati movies could "throw away" such stupidity. Shame on the actors to take this action and even comment on it as some of the work they can own. Saif Ali Khan - Totally disappointed in your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin to reach the afflicted and shows Akshay in a bleak picture. Anil is delayed another with the obscure charm of English. His friends deserved praise in their representation, and with the strange cinematic photography of the last 15 minutes, it was enough to raise the blood vessel. Do not waste any brain cells, energy or money to go to - see / see the AMU - with Konkana Sensharma instead - a beautiful piece of independent film that came from India at all. Intelligent, influential and story-telling story that would touch everyone with smart actors and gave me hope that everything in the Indian film industry would not be lost.
