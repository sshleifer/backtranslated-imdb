I used to think that movies require plots, or some other means that make you care about the story line or anything that happens. This film has shown me that you do not really have to have something like this. <br /> <br /> I can sum it up this way. But, IMDb wants to have more fonts. It was pretty nice. No convincing at the slightest. The way the characters speak in the film makes you think it should have happened over the course of days, but there's no passage of time and I'm sure all of this happens within one hour. <br /> <br /> If you're looking to entertain yourself, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before you get rid of it. It will be a much better use of your time. Time will never return. Jurassic Park 3 was better pulled out of this film.
