I must say that this was the worst film for Preadarshan (which was released along with much better kyonki and which was also his guideline), which does not contain a specific story and focuses only on the physical presentation by actresses for the first time and some ridiculous comedy series. I think priyadarshan has become very repetitive in his comedic clicks just like Govinda and David dhavan have done in the past having given some good artists who followed him also to lose their fans. So it would be good for him to focus more on the script and try some differences in its direction. Give us more hairstyles and weekly boredom instead of giving flaws like Garam Masala!
