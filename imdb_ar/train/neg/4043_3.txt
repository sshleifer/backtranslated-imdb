The film begins with promise, but remains long in a dark-brown world of distance and alienation. We have left commentators, but without anything else, you can save the weak shots from the masculine and serious faces of the taste. Certainly no rope on the wall to help us climb. It is shameful, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We have left wondering why the loving couple - father and son - should be less than the real world so that their world is the best when the phobia is beyond all imagination. This loss of existence in the real world clearly and unnecessarily contradicts the son who was recruited into the armed forces. Why not circus, so we can at least estimate some colors? We have left with a sense of loss, but unfortunately there is no enlightenment, which is puzzling because the film is about a form of collection is not available to all of us.
