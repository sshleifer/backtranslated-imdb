Celia Johnson is as good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is as good as Capulet, although he is soothing and cherished and has no patch on King Lear. John O'Connor reads the verse well as well as the monk Lawrence although he did not take it anywhere. Alan Rickman is as good as Tybalt, in his first "yuk" roles that make him famous. Benfolio for Christopher Strauli is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The groups are beautiful, if not as spectacular as they are in some other BBC Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> That's it. The rest is weak to appalling. Rebecca Sayer was 15 at the time of production and had no idea how to act in Juliet. She opens her eyes wide and grumbles every line exactly the same way. Patrick Reicart is not suitable for her, and his self-respect is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and calmly without any emotional or dramatic impact. Their death comes as a relief. If I have a dagger, I would have given them hours ago. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is not described as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his good work at "Brideshead Revisited". The mirror of Shakespeare's verse breaks into a thousand words or three words each, then shrapnel shouts in a separate and incomprehensible way. In this production, Queen Mab relinquishes. shocking. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakov, presents only an intermittent gift to put the camera where we will see what we want to see. The opening brawl is not remarkably coherent. However, there is a hilarity when Romeo is apparently embroiled in a subsequent conflict. Tybalt then grab the area offended. However did you get through? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended in the classroom or much more.
