There is a note that one of the heroines has been raped by a "drunken frenzy" by Russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. This movie should not be displayed just because of this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement by someone, KGB tried "Jews, Roma and others", "worse than the Nazis." The KGB was looking for so-called "Zionist" agents, who (KGB believed) were imperial agents. This is completely different from targeting Jews as an entire nation, as the Nazis did. Gypsies were not prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool and politically used, but from an international point of view. Communists did not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is spreading like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, KGB general look completely false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are fully formed, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended to watch - this film is full of lies and false things. Go to the "Good Shepherd" instead.
