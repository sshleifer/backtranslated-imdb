Here is another European story of blasphemy attacking the religion of their country. (These atheists filmmakers do not tire). Here we see a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This has already won the Oscar for the foreign film. This is probably because the story has made Catholics and religious faith generally seem very weak. One of the main characters is the priest who is more interested in food than anything else. He portrays it as nothing but an idiot. No wonder the secular-dominated academy loved this film. <br /> <br /> Also, there is some over-asshole who plays the role of a man who gives up his religion so he can marry one of the four girls in the story. The girls turn to seduce the student "estate" (who said he studied for six years but says he does not know!). I mean, how blasphemous is this film? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another excellent example of the progressive secular fanaticism of cinematic works around the world (not just Hollywood).
