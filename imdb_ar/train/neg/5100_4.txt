This wonderful anime series begins: an interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully presented and executed. Not everything is explained immediately, hanging on a gay island in front of the viewer, prompting the viewer to watch each subsequent episode. But imagine disappointment to find that the adventure of science fiction / robot giant is only a background for the exploitation of psychological preaching and quasi-religious. If you want to hear "You're okay, it's good to be you". After you have stumbled upon negative slogans and feelings of negative characters, this is right for you. If you want a good and fun science fiction click to watch, forget it. Both original and alternative endings were very disappointing for me. All this, this film was very preacher.
