I have read many good reviews that have defended and criticized various aspects of this film. One thing I see again and again is the annoyance of Megan, a perfect politics scientist, who is trying to change the world. I loved her personality. Maybe, because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'll change the world too, so I'm calling Majan. Besides, it's cute. She is not a great model, but more than a nice girl nearby. <br /> <br /> Well, so I cried and cried a lot. It is very exciting, seems exaggerated, but does not fit her character? She continues this show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She believes people who enjoy this offer are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, as a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face. I think her behavior accurately depicts a young girl showing her moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Moreover, I think she maintained a certain dignity during the film despite the desperate position she was in. <br /> <br /> As for the film in general, unlike Megan, it was largely what I expected. He had excellent gore sights, according to small budget standards. Perhaps this plot took a quick idea, hardly any thought. It's basically just a meaningless dark comic, as the name suggests. I love a sadistic doctor. He kept the Megan shirt torn apart, not only because of the corrupt (though largely), but also for torturing her, before he killed her. The sawmill was hilarious. For film lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> This movie was given 4 out of 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in horror that is a scare in the small budget.
