... but that will make you wonder if we have anything in the first place! This movie is as bad as any other horrific horror today. A man walks around semi-naked ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene includes a man around him and flows around the group for three full minutes, covering everything with what must be more than ten gallons of "blood." The film also tries to create a sense that what a man does with his girlfriend is wrong and opposed to nature, but the film has been done very badly, it is impossible for the public to avoid any sense of shock or anger. This film can not be dark and careless, it can not even get its own title - the initial credits refer to "the mind that will not die", but end credits label it "the head that will not die".
