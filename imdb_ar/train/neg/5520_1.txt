This movie was filmed in the trailer as a comedy. It is a tragedy. He left me sick on my stomach. I hated that. I think if they want to make a film like this more than they should be men enough to reflect the real intentions of the film in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I had known it. I think the trailer should reflect the film's theme and intentions. I'm tired of that. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I was very disappointed. I have passed several days and yet I still have a bad taste in my mouth of this film. I never felt disappointed in a movie, and did not write a comment on a bad film. I really think that the real deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intent of the film, no one would see it.
