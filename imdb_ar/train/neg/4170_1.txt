This is just an out flat inaccessible. If there is a story here somewhere, it is buried deep under the ugly characters and the work of the camera is volatile and this is indistinguishable. There are a group of vampire hunters who walk around doing something, and the vampires who kill them have a few foreigners inside. They shout and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine blood and skin covered with a foreign cow screaming in horror as the cowboy shepherd shakes the cattle, that's what you get here. These people are loud, obnoxious, violent, and very annoying. Then there are some anti-human beings who stand in their CGI space and are so pompous that it is impossible to bear them. These people make Hillary Clinton seem extreme right-wing in comparison. They are friends with some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then the camera works. Remember how everyone hates a crap a thousand minutes per minute from the recent Rolleball edition? People who made this movie love these things. There are enough of them here for three really exciting videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
