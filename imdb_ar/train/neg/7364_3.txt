In 1692, Salem, twisted child lies about the involvement of a slave in magic sends an entire society into a fuss. The fashion show starring Claudette Colbert and Fred McMurray is not suffocating, although it is not a vivid picture of infectious hysteria. The elements of the story are very interesting (especially from outside of Hollywood in 1937), where he worked on three books (Walter Ferris, Dorothy Grimstead and Bradley King), although anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's The Crossplay. Even the melodrama shown here will not be tolerated for too long. The biggest problem may be the picture: Colbert and McMurray represent an unequal pair of lovers hampered by the witch hunt, McMurray being a very contemporary presence for these surroundings. * 1/2 of ****
