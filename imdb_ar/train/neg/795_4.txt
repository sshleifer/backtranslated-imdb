When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a good horror film, but that was quite different, representing what I did in describing it as an early effort in science fiction. Both Karlov and Iglesias play the role of scientists (Rukh and Bennett, respectively) - to some extent competitors, even Rukh wins Bennett with a demonstration proving his great theory. The science here - at least - is a little rough around the edges (and hence science fiction, focusing on fiction) but somehow Rukh makes a kind of ray of Andromeda that allows him to look at Earth "several thousand million years ago." At the time before history, a huge meteorite swept into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance called scientists "Radium X" - which can be healed and destroyed. Much of the film is in Africa, exhausted, in search of meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and makes fun of making a large weapon, unfortunately afflicting himself with a kind of disease that makes him a great weapon as well. <br /> <br /> Both Karlov and Igosi were good here. Lugosi has a role in which a good man is good, although I found him somewhat unconvinced - especially in the scenes in Africa. The story was also filled with a short period of time, and as I caught my eye, she did not catch me. Given that this is already science fiction and not a horror flick, and that Sci Fi was in its very early stages, I think the film needs to cut a bit of a recession. It was ok - nothing more, but also no less. 10/04
