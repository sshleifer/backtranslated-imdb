One of the most unprofessional movies about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of this film do not really know about the world of programmers. <br /> <br /> The top 20 programmers in the world, the program you have special satellites (why?), the program uses the frequency of the satellite, someone kills someone to steal symbols (why?) and much more than the moments Stupid in this film. <br /> <br /> Peoples that are not programmers will see something terrible in this movie, because it is not a pro in this. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find the movie strange and suspicious - because many of the moments in the film are not related to real life (why is not the film science fiction in this case?).
