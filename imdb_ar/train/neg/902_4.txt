I assume that this film today is important because it was an early film Sofia Loren. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because I wanted to see some of Sophia Loren's early works. I was surprised when she appeared on the camera after her skin was painted brown to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Certainly, today, this was seen as a disguise and must be avoided in filmmaking. It's really annoying to watch Ms. Lorraine paint the skin throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it would have been better to make this film if the real opera singer had made this film. After that, the singing and actual facial gestures of the real artists were obvious. I rule out other people's comments about whether the real opera singer is older and heavier. <br /> <br /> Lauren was pretty at the age of 19 and still still, it was best to receive the movie as it was though it was being performed on stage. After all, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with the "old opera singers" singing behind the curtain! Do not underestimate the success of heavy Opera singers. One has only to refer to the most technically produced TV commercial of J. G. Wentworth with the opera singer on stage and they sing professionally for the company's product. This is one of the most entertaining and entertaining TV ads to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing also makes this production somewhat less quality. The colored ink faded a lot and could not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on a DVD, the production company must add translations in English so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know the words they say. That will help the story and learn more than the narrator give 30 seconds of the introduction to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this opera. Apart from Mrs. Sophia Lorraine, none of her participating representatives are known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you love Ms. Lorraine and want to see her at the age of 19 - regardless of production. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
