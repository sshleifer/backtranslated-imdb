I never understood Garbo's call. She's always caught in her movies stuck, not all that seductive, and that annoying sound that could have drowned in the Tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, such as Gloria Swanson, who is in much better shape in the left in the silent era. In this last film, her performance was very mediocre and uncertain. She tries hard but does not come all because the script is worse than her representation. <br /> <br /> The Romball game will be built-in, absolutely unbelievable and will never leak (although Melvyn Douglas manages to get the air in the skiing, which is really the only thing here). <br /> <br /> There was a possibility but the script failed in almost every section, wasting each representative in it. Douglas and Garbo had good chemistry together, but this spot is not a place in Ninotchka, which I found too exaggerated.
