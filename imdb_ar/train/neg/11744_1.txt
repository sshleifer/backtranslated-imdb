After watching this whole film in its entirety, I feel the mystery of the passion both critics and users have received online. Is it the worst West at all? No, I will not say that. But "The Last Great Western American," a phrase I've seen applies to her more than once? not near. <br /> <br /> The film that tries to tell a story like this needs credible characters talking about a believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most unreleased films I've never seen before. The film can be measured with a minute per minute. As in the number of times an actor or actress is forced to write something that no one in real life says? There are many examples of this that distract attention. Cheesy lines come to you in waves. Predictable, non-native, often. <br /> <br /> If the bad dialogue does not bother you, what about the bad battles? Few Westerners can show you that fighting with firearms is unbelievable at all while trying desperately to make you take action seriously. It is fine if there is a comic advantage of such firearm fighting, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone, the highly-planned and very meticulous choreography of early firearms is another reason to keep this film out of the list of good Westerners. The final standoff The filmmaker is somewhat successful in this outcome, but by then I was so interested in the film that it was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Unlike those flaws, I can say that the pictures are amazing - a good shot of the movie and the settings all look great. Representation is acceptable, especially given what has been given to actors to work with. However, if you are looking for another great Western American, do it yourself - an unforgivable lease instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
