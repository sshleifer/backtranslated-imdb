It is hard to find any positives in this film. It seems as if the product needed to make a profit without much effort, so we were dealing with the full display of Galaxy, which is excuses for a film in history. Police girls looked very sexy in uniform. More interesting footage of the two policemen and less of the Galaxy was the way to go. Of course this would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with a miserable reboot. Ms. Albright is not looking sexy and excellent for her first class. Ms. Stabs, who has heard about her but has not seen it on screen before, looks very desirable but seems to lack the basic talent of acting. Apart from Ms. Albright this is the real garbage.
