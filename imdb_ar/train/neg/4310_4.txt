This film revolves around a very exciting Olympic star who was appointed to coach the boys' basketball team in high school. Like Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, she starred as Cathy Lee Crosby in the starring role, and she does as much as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch was a better choice, but given the budget of the TV movie, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks fantastic in every shot, but we have not seen her completely naked. The story is largely predictable, to say the least, does not offer surprises. The lucky young Michael Bean plays the male role. He is the star in the team and also the love of love for Cathy Lee. Kenan Win has some entertaining scenes like the rich old man who runs the sports program and does not think that women should train sports. This point is thrown throughout the film, needless to say, dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put her team in any nontraditional training sessions; she does not do anything a male trainer will not do. There is a funny sub-plot involving a tall and un-bright player, undergoing a hypnosis process in order to pass his lessons and play like pro basketball player Sidney Weeks. Everyone seems to have had a good time producing this film, but the only real reason to see it is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a wonderful actress, but she has a wonderful smile, beautiful hair and a very tan body.
