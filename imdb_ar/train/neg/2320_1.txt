The film was produced for the Asian / Chinese market, and specifically targets Jay Chou fans, one of Asia's biggest music stars. <br /> <br /> Jay Cho is a very talented songwriter / singer. He is modest as an actor, although he has appeared in many large budget productions ("The Initial D", "The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he has won the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and Hong Kong Film Awards for his debut film "D". <br /> <br /> The support team has been selected very well, and is mainly appealing to everyone from China. Actors including many famous actors in cinema / television, singers and even commentators on sports (Huang Jianxiang of China). However, they have not been given enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Zhou took over as director and writer. He has a reputation for producing shallow, mindless films based on incoherent texts. Because of his bad story of guidance and frustration, the entire talented cast of actors, the enormous vision effects and the sounds of production money have been wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the terrible film has earned more than $ 10 million, and perhaps more in Asia, making it one of the biggest box office successes in Asia. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: You can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talent are lost, or if you simply accompany your children who are Jay Chu lovers.
