Well, maybe I was 13 years old like me in this movie. About this pampered rats, who live in a palace. Then drag the mouse down the toilet! And ends up in this rat city and meets this girl the rat who has a jewel wants a greedy frog. He will do anything for these gems, he sends a full army after these two mice. He plans to take gems and dump the city of rats! The wonderful part about this movie is mollusks. They do all the sound effects. They sing and make sounds, it's very cool and funny. Bottom line, they are aimed at 7 years of age. Another wise, wonderful film that takes a younger family member to see it. I did not think the animation was a real art for the works of your dreams, like a WAllace and Gromit I think it slowed down a bit in that. The film was only fit and not worth spending $ 9.50 though, sorry.
