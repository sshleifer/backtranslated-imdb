About the worst movie in the distribution now! I like zombie movies and I saw it in the pregnant carrier so I thought why not? Oh my god shame on zombie movies and fans of this genre! Everyone who makes this movie needs to put your camcorder and go to a movie school! There are a lot of hunting dogs that have put some time and effort into their films and have something that this film does not respect. I know it takes filmmaking, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making the meat market, but none of that money went to work well. You need actors, screenplay, real camera, investing in some books on how to produce independent movies. I do not know how I got a DVD version but from doing so it is either a really good friend or his head beats on the wall. In Gore films it's quality rather than quantity, and the effects are weak! I was so angry that this was actually in the shops and I could not recover my money. Please if you have seen this movie write here and put an end to the shlock. I know that I am very cruel, and I only had 10 lines so I'm trying to get to this point.
