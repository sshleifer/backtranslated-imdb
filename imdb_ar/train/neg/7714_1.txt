Albright, damn, MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like such cheap parody and cheese 70. The idea that large hordes of deadly tomatoes destroy the United States is a wonderful idea, though, the Moovie film offers some decent laughs, and It is clear that the scene of terrifying additions escapes the big fake tomatoes. The film, along with Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at parody, which became popular in the 1980s and 1990s thanks to Airplane! This one, like a moost parody, is very bad. Many humor attempts are dismal failures, and will stimulate a lot of moaning. But thanks to rotten tomato hordes, the infamous "Puberty Love" song, and the spectacular scene of a helicopter crash, the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes provides some goods, although they are largely for the wrong reasons. There are many wrong things in this movie ... That's right, it's hard to explain. You should also enjoy enough tomatoes in two Moore films and an animated series !! Big pieces of time spent away from the tomatoes are very boring. And dig those 70 clothes, dude! ; = 8) These tomatoes are seed and not cheesy, but they deserve a chuckle or two. MooCow says grab the pizza and pop in the tomato !! : ??
