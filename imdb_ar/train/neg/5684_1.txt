The trash is badly oriented. The weakest sadistic nerd is mediocre ... if you're the kind who likes it ... see shrinkage. Even if you are that person, it does not make this movie good, representation is really bad, the story is full of holes in the plot, and the director should really give up and find a real job because he has no talent in this film. I can see why people hate it .. We've shown some of his films recently and this is the best of them, which is really sad! It seems that the total absence of any kind of humanity suits some people, but it is just a grate. Horror movies can be full of ruin, can be miniatures, and can just be a good watch when there is nothing else ... SEED really poor.
