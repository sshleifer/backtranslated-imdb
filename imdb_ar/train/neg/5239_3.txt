I watched this movie based on the very favorable reviews I read about here by others. <br /> <br /> They certainly saw something in this film that I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The movie begins at a good pace, with the first 15 or 20 minutes of it interesting, then begins to log in and drop, not to mention completely disbelieving. <br /> <br /> In the end, you find yourself saying, "What?!? Will he do that too? Just how far will he go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with Jeff Jeffblbl, John, going to delicious food to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new shopkeeper, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John enters the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the man. It looks like a lot, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John becomes obsessed with Ogi Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that do not make any sense of logic, John, who enjoys a very good life, a beautiful loving girlfriend, a safe job with good salaries, a beautiful house, a beautiful car, expensive allowances - decides he wants to Be a loser like Auggie Rose, experience life in a low-paid job, live in a garbage dump with his noisy girlfriend, and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why this dim film got a half-baked positive views I will never know. Gold Plum certainly does a good job of acting - it's always - and his appearance improves with age - but unless you have a big fascination with Jeff Goldblum, but you have to see every movie he brings, I will not recommend this turkey. It will not take two hours of your life - and you will not - and believe me - you will have nothing to thank at the end of these two hours, other than your gratitude because you still do not sit there to watch this movie! <br /> <br />
