It seems that this is a good film, and I think it will be a good film, as long as I wish this film was useful for my time, and yes, I must admit that the talent of acting from Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Bahri is truly commendable, but despite the best efforts, This film did not reach much in the delivery of a meaningful message, which seems to have been what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point comes short and it seems that the end is unsatisfactory after all that happens; much like real life in this regard, but the films unlike the real life end in about two hours and the end must make the audience satisfied, if that is indeed the intention of the director. This shortens in this regard and this is what bothers me most. <br /> <br /> The other side that intrigued me was the national stereogram of American characters - they all seem to be engraved from the same group. . It seems to me that most of the American characters in Indian English films depend on how ordinary Indians perceive Americans as clearly and clearly no effort has been made to give any depth or complexity to any American in the film. <br /> <br /> These two sides have been put together in a disappointing story.
