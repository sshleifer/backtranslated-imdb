This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, he was barely in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and feel bored, keep watching this movie. Words can not describe how dumb she is. Sorry Michael. The cinema was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you watch it, it looks like a soft porn, but without scenes of nudity or hot scenes. This film had sexual references, because it revolves around the S & M killer underground. The acting was bad, except for the parts of Michael Madsen. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he gets a good pay for this bad film. It's something I will not be proud of. It's not even a B movie for cable, it's like an F and it should never be shown.
