This is complete and absolute, a good example of a BAD film, and this can not be attractive to anyone, not even to film lovers. No, repeat, do not waste your precious time in your life on this garbage. Bad behavior, bad guidance, terrible script (but I mean really terrible), and a complete lack of idea about what entertainment (in any form). I bought a DVD for $ 3 and swore I could pay someone to take it. Burning will not be enough for what this film did to me. I love B movies, deadly games, exotic lake monsters, but this is not anywhere nearby. You know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Just plain old pathetic.
