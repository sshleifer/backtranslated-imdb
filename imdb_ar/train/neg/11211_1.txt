There are a lot of mistakes in this film, but to sum it up: Terrible acting - very bad, it must be intentional. Poor script - maybe they had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story. The end is ridiculously bad - in some cases, I finally managed to save the film - not in this case. If you can sit in the whole movie, you'll need to kick yourself in the end because the end is not worth the wait. This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture sitting through this film, I appreciated someone who warned me in advance. Do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you do not have something better than that. However, you will regret your untold torture.
