I watched this movie several times in the late 1960s / early 1970s when he was raised like a reindeer with rabies in November to December as a baby show on Saturday. It has always been a tough competition for Christmas that almost never happened (excuse me - can I say "Christmas"?), Probably the greatest movie of the Christmas season and the most famous of all time. But this is another review. <br /> <br /> At that time, I was impressed by the on-screen SANTA color that CLAUS was almost "pink and white", and the color of the prints torn by its teeth changed color. <br /> <br /> The movie is rather creepy! I thought about that time - and I still do it already. I was very comfortable at the time, so I still! It's amusing in a kind of "dwarf retirees". By the way, the picture quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than in the theater, around 1969-1974. <br /> <br /> If you expect, maybe "RANKIN-BASS Christmas Special Lost" if you want FELLINI DOES Christmas - Read ... <br /> <br /> By its nature, dubbing on these foreign films ( The original version here in Spanish) makes it always look "surreal". This adds to the films inherently strange, and it is also very frightening that the "evil devil" (as shown in the original American transcript) spends the entire film trying to turn "evil" children. The key to "lock" wants to have parents for Christmas - suddenly, the "family outlet" comes out of the "giant Christmas gifts" until he realizes that he only dreams! Watch this, Christmas lovers - and if you are Stoner, save your hiding - this The movie will make you think you're hallucinogenic ... no drugs!
