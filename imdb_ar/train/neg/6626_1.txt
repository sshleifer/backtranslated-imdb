I saw the movie and got screwed, because the film was stupid and boring. I thought that Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work, but unfortunately the failure and failure of the entire film damaged Schulai. The cast and her crew was bad. The whole theater sleeps while watching the movie Some people fled in the middle. Amitabh Bashan was a bad actor. I thought it would be the biggest success this year, but this film will be the biggest flop of the year. No one has done justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. This movie does not deserve any fans. I bet that this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "Finally these movies"
