This film is a waste of film stock. Do you think that a map of a military plan will be placed on a easel on a courtyard in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this film. Do you think that someone from DEAF will actually be recruited into an active duty army in Europe during the Second World War to work in the "Negro" unit ... cooking, logistics services, burial details, etc.? It happened in this film. Do you think a black officer (presumably smart) would choose the same DEAF K.P. To be part of an active combat mission to protect the dam from its destruction by the Germans before the arrival of the Allies? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was approaching behind and killing him and killing him? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers are being held in a barn on a German-run farm that will release their feelings in front of the sight of German soldiers who were only 50 years old? They did so in this film, leaving any possible entrances to the barn that Germans might inspect without complete protection. Do you think that the captain, on the airwaves and in clear English, mentioned the rank of the general, if not his name, as the person he spoke to said that the general, in clear English on the open air waves, said that the dam should be protected the next day? Perhaps they should have sent an envoy to clarify the direction from which the American attack would come to ease the Germans. This film should be put on the list of the top 50 films. If so, I'm sure that would be good. Watch it at your own risk.
