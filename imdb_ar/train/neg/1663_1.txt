First of all, this plot is way overpriced - the girl wants to make her, everyone loves her, and the snake girl intervenes, all look lost, the girl attracts, everyone loves her again, etc. Throw in something appropriate, male charming heroine, plus single parent problems that are predictable so you can practically read them. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to dispel classical music. They send out a message that all classical music players are tense, suspicious and close to the horizon - in fact, I do not remember exactly this quote, but I remember at some point in the film, "Why are they doing? Really how classical music is classified in this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I've gone through it dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of making this film is to promote Britney Spears. There is no point at all. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, while the actress who photographed Holly (I'm not sure if it really sang it or not) was enjoying a fairly good sound, it was not as amazing as they did - especially when she was wearing a belt . She has been winning her support all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Stars.
