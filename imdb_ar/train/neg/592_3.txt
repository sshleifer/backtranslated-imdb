All logic goes straight from the window of the train In this British horror film, which is located in the London Underground and represents the usually dependable Run Lola Run, Franka plays Keith, a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who Fall asleep in the subway station, just to wake up and find that she has been locked up and find herself chased by "someone" or "something" with deadly intent. <br /> <br /> The holes of plot and unreliability are scattered and there are very few moments that are actually revolting / scary, but many of them are just boring. <br /> <br /> All in every unpleasant film must remain completely closed forever and give us all the advantage. <br /> <br /> The only additional point here is the famous veteran actor Ken Campbell, who did a better job of this? This is even including Erasmus Microman!
