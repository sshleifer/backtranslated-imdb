Rumors say that when NASA's technical advisors asked the film to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a political or work / shuttle crew, you will not get in the shuttle. In addition, there is a Space Camp in Alabama, not in Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events described in this film become possible. This film was intended for children and was supposed to have been written by one of them, because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie ever, and flipping was well deserved.
