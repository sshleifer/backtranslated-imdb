This Drummond entry lacks continuity. Most of them have elements of absurdity, postponed wedding, and so on. However, this contains a series of endless events that occur in the dark near the run of characters from one place to another. The house looks like a city. There are also Liu c. Carol who is a clear suspect does not seem to be seen. It is strange and behaves somewhat suspiciously, but it seems that Drummond and people do not pick up anything. However, it is a fairly good procedure and a good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algei is supposed to be a comedian, but like Nigel Bruce in Sherlock Holmes salary he clicks, he's so clownish that it's hard to imagine anyone with the taste or intelligence around him. Does his successor have a history of explaining how he and Drummond became partners?
