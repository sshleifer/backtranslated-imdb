This was already the worst film I ever saw. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? She looks absolutely horrible through the entire film, and the hair is very bad! They speak like monotonous sounds and there is nooo chemistry. The DVD cover does not approach remotely what the film is about. Really, really boring. I had to progress quickly through some of that because it was very painful to watch it. I really want to know how anyone on earth can think this is a good thing? Haha literally just like to say "yes" and there is no passion at all. I could not say at all that they were in love. I'm sorry but this was the worst sadness for a film I think I've ever seen.
