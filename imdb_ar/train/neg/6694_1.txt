I've really hoped in this film because I saw Carrie in a few other things and I think she enjoys some talent. Unfortunately, this case is a case study which should not be done in a scenario. Completely indeterminate characters without an atom of admiration, and no plot at all. Is it a road / companion / comedy / thriller / love story / drama? Directors have no idea and we do not.
