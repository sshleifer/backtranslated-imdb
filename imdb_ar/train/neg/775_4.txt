John Candy. Need to say more? It is the main reason for watching this film. Most people do not realize how talented he was as an actor. Watch him change from poor slop to horny shiver. Just change the (hidden) simple face and off we go. There are many wonderful bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John climbs up (on an ecstasy) on stage and talks about how much his girlfriend's love - that is how much he and his girlfriend's love is for his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this might think that this sequence looks really rough. It is, but it is also very funny because John Candy is doing this thing. The story in general is very lame and Eugene Levi and Joe Flaherty (both graduates of SCTV with Candy) are given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments, especially the wedding photography at the end (Think of Rod Serling) and the wonderful scene when talking to his mother over the phone. Overall a good movie if you have a difficult day and you need to put your mind on the stupid. I give this one out of 10.
