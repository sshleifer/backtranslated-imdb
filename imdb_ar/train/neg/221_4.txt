I was gifted with this film because he had a wonderful idea, the friendship of three women bankrupt by a woman who falls in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Not exciting. <br /> <br /> No! I am quick to add. All these women are portrayed as extreme cartoonists who do not support one another and conspire to frustrate each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chanselor and Imelda Staunton can not make mistakes in my book before seeing this, but here they are given a bleak text and asked to balance the work between the paper and paper pulp, which does not work well when all women are well-known professionals Very small town. <br /> <br /> For smart women they spend a whole pile of time avoiding the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that much could have been done with decent writing and more tension. The sub-plot of lesbians anywhere did not succeed and the women smokers / buyers (all in their thirties ???) were very unrealistic - even in the child's scene - Give me a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, shame wasted. 4 of 10.
