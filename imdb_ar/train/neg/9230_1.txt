I must qualify this title, now that I think about it. Going out is not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time, I laughed hard at the expense of the film. So I think it's worth something for it. It is also worth the pain I suffered in my first sight. As another reviewer points out, this film is literally penetrated. Not a single original thought went to this film (making the comment below about the originality of the hypothesis completely confusing to me). The film is only a long series of cliches that are linked together and displayed as a film. They certainly are not the following scribes, and they are certainly not original, which is not "good fun and clean at all". The movie is an absolute suffering for beginners (after watching it for the first time, the second time can be very funny, in a humiliating way). While I looked around the theater, it was clear that almost everyone, with the exception of the elderly, felt bored or hurt by this film. During some particularly emotional scenes, such as the place where his mother Nick chewed, the audience was actually swinging because it was so bad. I even heard someone groaning in the theater, something I had never seen before. I do not care where you have the opportunity to see this film, be it at a film festival, an independent theater, or anywhere. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie with revenge. Unless you are like me and you can not resist the opportunity to see what might be the worst film indeed.
