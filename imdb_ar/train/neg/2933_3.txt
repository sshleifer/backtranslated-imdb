If you have read the book - do not place your hopes high, if you have not read it - read it, and you have never seen the movie. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was much involved in scriptwriting (as he claims in the post-book text). Because the film is completely different from the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that what the film aims to achieve - taking an exciting and thought-provoking piece instead of combining simple philosophical ideas with ridiculous irony so that everyone can understand them - it achieves perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for sitcoms, and has lost any meaningful message that it could have been. <br /> <br /> You're better off not seeing it.
