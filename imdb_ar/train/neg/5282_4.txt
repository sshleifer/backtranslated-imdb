I must admit I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete with the 1995 edition. The reason I saw it was that I was not quite satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as captain and I think Winterthur Robert Benry Jones looked like the captain I imagined when I read the book. It was also. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only quality to redeem the movie value. The rest resembles the United Nations Austin as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliott did not miss the streets of Bath like this. It was not in her personality and never happened by a lady at those times. Anne Elliott of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful historical anomalies, but that was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotations from the book, they are at very inconvenient moments, warning those who know the book as another important part of the book. Will be either missing or completely variable. <br /> <br /> Although this version is not much shorter than the other version, everything seems to have been pushed. Care was taken to present the characters and show their tendencies and motivations. Important scenes deleted. How can the final scenes be slaughtered in this way? Disaster ! It was not portrayed as beautifully as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austin, do not waste your time with this.
