Just a warning ... this is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not see it until the end ... it's a waste of time ... I really regret it because Snipes it ended up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Terrible acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I recommend you watch this movie is if you really want to see how the movie should not be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are looking for Snipes, surrounded by helicopters and cars, firing inside the building, but still whispering so Snipes does not doubt.
