William Ross is the main character throughout this TV movie. Leave his family behind and only start to pay off his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. This is where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes, playing several different roles, to persuade him to return home. <br /> <br /> The story is mediocre and I was actually able to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it to a fairly beautiful degree. But William Ross was not really a star. However, his representation seems to be still fine. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how to anticipate everything. In fact, in the last 20 minutes, I could almost dictate a word before it happened. The film should not be as good as this. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a substandard film. In the character classification system, you will get a "D".
