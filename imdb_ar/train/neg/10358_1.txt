I read The Wrinkles In Time and watched the movie. The film contained all the elements in the book, but since the book was 190 pages long and the film two hours, it was very cramped with a lot of influences and misconduct. <br /> <br /> Wrinkles in time revolve around a girl called Meg, and Charles Wallace, and Calvin must cooperate together to find Meg's father and get off the island of Kamazuts. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really stinky. The behavior is terrible, the trend is funny, and yet positions are not necessary. I really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engel who wrote the book and made the film and made a wonderful book and a terrible film. Representation is worse than any direct representation of the video. Yes, I must admit that there were wonderful effects. But seriously everything was done terribly and not serial in any way possible. If you read the book, the movie will crush you. I wish I could give it 0 but unfortunately I can only give it.
