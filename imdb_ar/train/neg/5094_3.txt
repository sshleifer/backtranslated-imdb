This film sucked. Acting sucked, sucked the script, and the film generally sucked. There were two themes in the film that were not developed and the viewer had to do some work to see what was happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that it should be clarified, but suddenly you find things happening and said as if you have a clue what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> The hero's negative comments about the hero. The audience has never shown how to know even anything about a man and how he relates to the death of her fianc√©. The viewer has minimal exposure to the man's death as well. <br /> <br /> Also, suddenly, there is a scene with a group of men loading up to machine guns and that's all you see before you cut it to other scenes. There is no explanation for what happened about weapons and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave it 3 because we did not feel like we wanted our time. It was fun to talk about a bad movie while watching it, so it gave us at least a little bit of entertainment. ;-)
