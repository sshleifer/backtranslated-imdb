Protocol is a hard-to-believe film and its only grace is that it starred Goldie Hawn with a good group of supporting actors. The story revolves around a wonderful cocktail waitress who is famous after saving an Arab's life unintentionally. The story moves halfway through the film, and Goldie's magic does not keep this movie. Unless you're a fan of Goldie Hawn, do not go too far to watch this movie.
