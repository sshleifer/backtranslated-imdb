This very bad film in Australia appears as "Hydrosphere", a movie so bad that you are a sleeper and you have to watch it to the end, just to see if it can get worse ... and do it! The storyline can be predicted, apparently, written by a high school drama class, pathetic groups but slightly better than miniatures, wooden representation. <br /> <br /> From the Props cabinet of the Total Call. There does not seem to be one original idea in the entire film. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed all the way. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell must hang his head in shame. Obviously he needs money!
