I agree with the comments of other users that the two main roles have acted well, being the person who played the role of Gary Gilmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was too boring. I did not hear about the story, I did not know anything about Gary Gilmore before the film, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong I was. The whole film was just talking and talking and talking about his mother and father. The only wonderful scenes were memories of the past where the father would lose his temper. This was the only interest I got from this crossing.
