"Do not drink water" is a very bad film. It is based on the 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. She is the star of Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "Honeymoon". The director, Howard Morris, has appeared in many of the popular comedy films, Life Stinks, High An, Silent Movie, and an animated character (including Gopher from Pooh, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey ) What's wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the hypothesis is being implemented more seriously than it works effectively. Allen's original play was a tongue in cheek, which is why she worked at Broadway and in the new Allen 1994 edition. R.S. Scenario Allen and Harvey Pollock are on the death line and are making a lot of changes from the original play. Getting Gleason's wife out of the air in this release when she was a hard-working woman is only one example of why this did not work. <br /> <br /> Acting is not much better. Gleason does what he can with the material, but he can not save this. Gleason was a comedy genius, but he was also a great actor as he showed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality could have worked here, but the bad scenario does not give him a chance. so sad. Steele Parsons' air-conditioned wife will drive you after 20 minutes. Learn about the time it will take until you want to choke it. This is also a shame because it is an upscale actress, so I made two exceptional performances at Bonnie and Clyde and Rachel, Rachel did not have any other actors well either. <br /> <br /> Woody hated this film so much that he re-produced the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Cavner (Marg Simpson) in the shows. They were able to hit all the correct notes and the same movie as a comic masterpiece. She is finally on a video after a long battle over rights. Do go out and find this version. Everything that was original in 1969 is a good thing because it removes unwanted guests who have gone beyond their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 stars
