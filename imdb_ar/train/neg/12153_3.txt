Feeding The Masses was just another film trying to earn a little money from the zombie craze that happens, mostly due to the popularity of films such as Land Of The Dead and Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> Starting from a television station, guarded by the army, they report that the Lazarus virus is close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their work again. The problem is that this is not true. Zombies operate on a large scale and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them was Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Rachael Morris, the main anchor (who for some reason was included in Shelley's play on this site) and Roger Cohen, their military escort. Torch and Sherry oppose lying to people but the station is operated by the intelligence service (or some other government agencies) and is heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film gives itself a bet on its back on the back of my box saying, "We keep feeding the fans at a higher level than any of the three death films of George A. Rompero." The source of this quotation has lost all credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is bad. I do not mean as bad as I expected more (obviously I was), but I mean bad in that I could not find any replacement properties in the film, at all. Representation in all parts either finished or too wooden. Does anyone remember their lines or do they read braid cards? I can not even think of the best part of the film or the best actor / actress. There really was not one. If I have to give a signal to someone, I would say Roger, perhaps the military escort is the most interesting personal but this really does not say much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend passing this film, although the lid of the box looks good (this is what originally attracted me to the film). 10/03
