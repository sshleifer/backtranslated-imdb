Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. The frantic Robbie, who was thrown out by his girlfriend, does not want to be left alone on Christmas, so he decides to return to his childhood home, forcing a dysfunctional family to live and nominate them to form his family. Aflyk's abhorrent and monotonous act, which primarily acts with a cheerful smile, makes his character turn into a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and Uhara bring some life into this mess. Even for the farce, its absurdity is futile, not logical from one scene to another, and its false emotional messages like Appel's smile. 91 minutes, PG-13 rating. *.
