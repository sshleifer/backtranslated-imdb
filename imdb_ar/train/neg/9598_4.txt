Robert Columbia has two full-time jobs. He is known all over the world as a global television reporter. His exploits are less famous but equally useful are his exploits as a full-time protagonist. <br /> <br /> I saw "Vivre pour Vivre" dubbed "Live for Life" in English. Some life! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: one woman on her way out, one on her way, and a deceptive wife at home. That helps Robert a liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "My work took longer than planned." Spend a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms to succeed. You wonder how long this guy will be caught wearing his pants. <br /> <br /> Some may find his life exciting, but I thought it was boring. His friends, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and attractive women. But his lifestyle is very frantic and very deceiving, you wonder if he enjoys all this. <br /> <br /> Adding to the boredom is a big section that does not reinforce the plot. There are long sections without dialogue or dialogue in French only. We see documentary films about wars, torture and training of troops, interspersed with live events. When Robert returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane and taxis to arrive at the airport lounge. <br /> <br /> Annie Gerardotte is the leading lead in this film. Her personal salary was the most interesting and she played to perfection. It was also good to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can not fault Yves Montand's performance for what was basically immoral. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouche's novel techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera revolves around the room as Robert and his mistress argue. Observe them briefly during each passage around the room. In another scene on a sleeper in a train, Robert lies on the top bed while his wife is down. Robert gives his wife some interesting but sad news, but we hear parts of it only because of the clatter of the train. I felt that his wife was not able to absorb every word because of the horrible nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. Those scenes and those in Amsterdam were wonderful. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this film as part of a project in the Library of Congress. The project has been named FIFTY: 50 of the most memorable films in 50 years. According to what I can best define, this film, like the other 49 films you have selected, was not on video, television, or distribution in the United States since its original release. In my opinion, it should be made available again. <br /> <br />
