According to IMDb, as well as to each other Web site carries a review; this "thing" has no way out. Well, this certainly explains a lot! Just a group of people who gathered together to shoot some perverted pornographic series and throw a very short story about the worship of Satan and the sacrifices of women inside the walls of an isolated clinic. "Hardgore" is a prime example of a total of 70 miners, because it is really made with minimum production values ​​and scripting inspiration. The horror films about the satanic cults were very common during the 1970s and pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplified story about a young young girl committed to using my mind, and since the very first night, she has been attracted to a network of drugs, narcotic drugs, rape, torture, and dildo work. Really, a lot of dildo work. The friendly friendly nurse tries to warn her, but she has a hole in her throat even the same night. The aspects of horror are very bad, moving from the mask of the devil to the frightening attacks of the broken penis. Photographic and acting performances are almost unbearably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie that shows footage of artificial dildos firing sperm and talking about members of male genital mutilation? Leading lady Justinina Lynn is a pretty-looking girl with a gorgeous body, but most of her male and female stars are poor, oversized balls.
