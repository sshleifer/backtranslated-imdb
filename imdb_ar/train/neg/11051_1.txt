Horrible movie contains a group of Canadian actors who appear to be self-aware about the fact that they are in the camera so that their performance is very melodramatic and can be completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie is badly written, poorly edited, and poorly directed. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what is presented to him, but he is the only one in this film who does it - he really has a bad story and a script that works with him. It is not a camp enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> I have not yet seen Van Bielecki act reliably, and even minor characters such as Eisen (with his nasal and small voice) confirm that we have a lot in Toronto instead of the barge off Africa. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the "creature" looked like a jazz dancer in a strange suit? It is clear that the conflict between the blue lightning bolts and the Orange Pelleske rings about "magic" (due to lack of a better word) is the result of bad actors, with no dance designer, covered with fully derived special effects. Was there a way out on stage or in the editing room of this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... so as not to waste your time with this, you will regret it as you did. I have nothing else to say about celluloid waste.
