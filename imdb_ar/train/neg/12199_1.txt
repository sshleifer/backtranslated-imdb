- My sister has now watch this movie. We laughed at the deaf. Can you imagine on the covers that there is an Oscar nomination ?? - First, the music mixes about 4-5 different styles of music ... The music is not synchronized with the viewer and moves the character ... <br /> <br /> --- The main character Silvester does not fit there. It looks like a Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Russian soldiers are everything but not Russian faces :-) ----- Well, the main points: 1. A plane called a charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is the idea when Rambo goes to jump from the plane, but is stuck? Mix rope 3. Girl? The best scene is when you die. It means a lot to him. He has known her for some time? Screaming to her ... my God Samurai 4. How many shares? His arrow bag always filled with arrows? I did not notice a scene where they were gathering - but I saw the scene where the arrow remains in the helm of welding in Vietnam - and this is very important 5. How many rocket helicopters can they carry ??? (The real one) I've seen 4. But Rambus arrived to about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. Main part. What do Russian military helicopters do in Vietnam? After the war? 7. The first scene when he entered the camp of Vietnam ... The first idea was to liberate the shelter that stands on the tree on the open spaces, what is the idea more than once: 1. With a knife you can cut iron wire? Maybe only made in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - using to hit one man in a row? Oh my God, Americans really need to know about weapons! Do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer was watching a lot of films from World War II)
