Executive producer Wes Craven and financiers "Weinstein" were blamed for this huge budget disaster: the angry metal update of Dracula, with a verbal amazement at Bram Stoker (who may not want his name on this anyway) and nothing much for For the rest of us except jerks and dresses. Christopher Plummer is fascinated by Van Helsing in modern times - not just Van Helsing's scion but the real thing; he keeps the balls from the body of Count Dracula, taken from her coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and transported to New Orleans. This is what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, which was well produced but without a single original idea (except for multi-ethnic victims), is disgusting and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat itself. * from ****
