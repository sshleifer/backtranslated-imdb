Why would a person return to someone who strikes him in the teeth, not once, not twice, but repeatedly. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not only forgive him, but accept it completely). My God! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Obviously I did not bring in the inner Mazushi. <br /> <br /> With the first appearance of Pocatinsky, there are many wonderful aspects to this film; however, to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom, further personal development was useful. We never know Eli Masochi, in fact, we have led us to believe that he is not Mazuchia, although the emotional sadism Tom is very clear.
