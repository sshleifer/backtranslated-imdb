I have seen many films from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst thing was the "little known fun". I watched the "platform" yesterday evening and thought that two other films of Jia Zhangke should be better. This evening I was disappointed again. I will not watch "Xiao Wu" tomorrow evening because I just put the three films in the box! Both made this movie, "Platform" ten out of every ten, needs to watch more cinema! The photographs were very bad: it was very difficult to distinguish between some characters because of the lack of close work. The story was so disjointed that I quickly turned it to the end because of sheer frustration. I do not recommend this film to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kaji on any day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not fools!
