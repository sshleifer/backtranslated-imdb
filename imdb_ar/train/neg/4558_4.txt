Frankly, I was disappointed in the "expiration date". The title is very intelligent and interesting premise, but do not think it delivered. What was it about? The main person's desire to reconnect with his original roots? Or, most likely, his need to overcome his fear of death. However, he was not prepared as someone who lived his life in fear - his life seems to be going well, but since Judgment Day is approaching, he should now begin to worry. I did not buy it. At the same time, the supporting characters in the film do not seem to have needs blended into a comprehensive story. They were doing just everything, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a "curse" seemed more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? why? when? Finally, why did not he just plan to stay in his apartment all day of his birthday? This is my criticism, but I liked the Seattle footage, the cinema was beautiful, and the acting was good at times when it was not fantastic.
