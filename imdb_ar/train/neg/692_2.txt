One of the many slashes that appeared in the early 1980s, Pranks is notable only for the early performance of Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); her character dies fairly early, and the rest of the film can be completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas holiday, a group of students volunteered to clear a condemned college building from its furniture. However, a mad killer throws a key in the business through the systematic rise of young people one by one in horribly diverse ways. <br /> <br /> Exploiting every vulgar cliche in the book, director Geoffrey Obrow presents a hard and unrelenting horror that made me pray for the killing of characters, so I could keep watching something more valuable. The majority of deaths (which, let's face it, are why we watch this type of film in general) are not so brief. The truly deadly images come in the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the surviving survivors (there is one bloody body, the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the movie saves itself from the stigma of getting as little of me as possible by getting an unexpectedly nice pessimistic end, but it's really only complete for the youngsters.
