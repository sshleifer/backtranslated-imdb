Horrible, simply awful. It proves my theory of "star power." This is supposed to be a great TV because the man who brought out (Battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who steered this schtock schtick schtick for a chick. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Look for something more interesting for a thousand times - like watching TV without a picture and without sound. 1/10 (I rated it very high / there are no negative points in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory of "star power" is : The stronger the stars used in the display, the weaker the display. (Called indirect proportion: quality 1 / star power, sp less make better quality, etc. Another way to look at it is: "more less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
