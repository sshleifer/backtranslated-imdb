Do not waste 90 minutes of your time in "fast food, fast women." It is a disturbing random scenario with three story lines patched together very poorly because of predictable writing, terrible acting and even bad music. I found the main character that was an annoying appetite loss to watch it every time it was on the screen. Need SHE for fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend 90 minutes to devote to this turkey to do something more exciting ... like pruning your fingernails. You will have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film takes back is Louise Lassier, but it deserves much better than this tired scenario. He is as helpless as the older man who resorts to the film. <br /> <br /> Beware of the offer!
