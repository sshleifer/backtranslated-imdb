I hired this movie because it looked very fun, but for My Horror it was the worst film I've ever seen! Read the comment from Gumby-8 and be part of the crew or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old boy or a member of an emotional cult, no one in his right mind thinks that this film has any potential at all. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments of the Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Quote: "From the opening animation" Dune "inspired to the fast pace ... This film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repetition is unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was fun and the fact that the film keeps the eye moving, is good because you are still looking for any kind of thrill. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000.00, it became a colorful mask, and it became a classic. As far as "repetition is not unexpected" I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from the Gumby-8 is the only admirer: "Acting is also a strong aspect of the film." <br /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, her performance is no more than that of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The attractive description line: "Beware of the hour between dusk and darkness" <br /> </a> is some red paint on the paper above the body of the dead do not see. To my knowledge, there may be a range of weeds. <br /> <br /> In short, I saw horror stories from the fifties, sixties and seventies. I saw what I thought was the worst ever and some of it was very good. The director of this film did not try, sleep or take a dose of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to save a very bad job in the direction. I will give this film a rating of 0.5 for the film "B".
