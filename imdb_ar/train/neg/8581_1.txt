This apology for a movie does not revolve around anything at all! Rachel Griffiths must be in need of money. The film must be made with a very low budget, because the lighting did not exist. If I saw another Postlesumthingor house I would commit suicide. I'll be happy to see if there is 1) plot or 2) scenario. My biggest regret is that I waste my time watching this garbage.
