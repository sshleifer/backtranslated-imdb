It's a good thing that the result came to Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I hate to think about leaving it with free money. Not what his fans should remember. <br /> <br /> In his last years Brando looks more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film that Willis would have done looking for funding for his own work. Brando is the manager of a local prison in America, when he is located in a small rural environment usually the largest employer in the area. This gives the responsible person a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has one weak point to indulge in, namely the twin bimbo known as girls. Even when they are held simultaneously by the losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Hadden Church, their hearts are still owned by my father. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid that Brando wants to give them jobs in prison where they work under conditions that are not much better than those sentenced. What to do, but a robbery was committed on the train passing through the local area that often carry the money used to burn the treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has some moments of humor, most of the time it falls under the talents of all concerned. Some may include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorfino as his wife's son, but also a straight-pointing FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the staff have worked with someone who has rate many of the greatest American actor of the last century. Without Brando, about 40 years ago, Free Money would have been a driving force in a red state in America where the masses could see how they were being neglected. <br /> <br /> or a weak attempt was made to intimidate them.
