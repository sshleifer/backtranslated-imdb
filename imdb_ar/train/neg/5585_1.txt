The problem is the role of characters in the film. From man to man A British anthropologist kidnaps two pygmies and takes them to Scotland and realizes that they are not animals or humans but are actually equal to themselves. The problem is the role of the dwarves in the film - two people who were kidnapped and treated as animals, yet they gave such a shallow role and stereotypes within the film ... The British anthropologist ends up being a film because he "manages" his relationship with the dwarves ... no idea About the feelings of the hostages, from their point of view, about their plight ... I find it a shallow film, from the point of view of racism from one side ... She can never get away from the "white man"
