This may or may not be the worst film Steve Martin ever made, but it certainly was not at its best. Obviously, do this nonsense to check the payment. Drake like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to realize is that when people go to watch Steve Martin's film, they expect to be amused, not bored. It is sad that he pulled Dan Eckroyd and Phil Hartman down with him. I do not understand why talented people can not control the fact that people do not want to see them in bad movies. If you're going to make a comedy movie, it should be funny. This was not. Shame on the US military because it allowed itself to be linked to this door. Full Metal Jacket was laughing more than this miserable excuse for "comedy service". Phil Silves is certainly moving in his grave.
