<br /> <br /> The bowels of the Virgin are so strange and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret them self-reliably and apply whatever meaning he wants to the inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this is a deliberate feature of the film, it will be postmodern brilliance, but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without going into the outline, let's take a quick tour of events. In an isolated cabin, there are orgies, which include nude wrestling and baby diapers. A group of latecomers join the progeny in progress, but inadvertently recite a monster I would like to call the muddy ninja. This monster precedes the slaughter of the ornate participants one by one, with the exception of the homosexuality virgin (if you do not count the oral sex) that receives his offspring and thus becomes very enthusiastic with the desire to masturbate with the hand of a broken person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the courage is withdrawn, and then there is a scene that seems to mean that she is pregnant with a muddy ninja child. Got all this? If you will rent this movie, it is best if you do not speak Japanese and do not have any subtitles. In a season full of boring Hollywood jokes, this may be put into your VCR's Film Equalizer for shock therapy. Would definitely be something different.
