The only reason I remember that is that it was shown the following week to broadcast the wonderful Nigel Kenil series QUATERMASS. The trailers focused heavily on the fact that the main character had a deformed arm, which made me hope that Victor Caron would be the QUATERMASS experience that haunts the streets of London. <br /> <br /> Take this luck because the game RACING GAME is just a horror film to some extent with a gimmick to have a hero with a physical handicap in an attempt to get to the bottom of investigations into the rotten horse race. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you may enjoy it but you will put it in the context of the late 1970s when the SWEENEY was just finished and the professionals are still producing, something that lacks racing. One of the trailers was marked with a car over another. If it was cut off for the SWEENEY, you would see Jack Reagan taking a car and hitting a confession of subversive malice while the professionals took more than one car and blew up terrorists inside. I think this summarizes what is wrong with this series
