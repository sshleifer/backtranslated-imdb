In fact there is not much to say about Lady Las Vegas. It's harmless enough, but it's a little more than a boring steal film from the seventies. The film is neither smart nor exciting as it seeks to be. The plot is a story from the story of the old tired casino robbery that was carried to death. Except for Las Vegas Lady, I think the theft plot was designed by a 3 year old child. The plan includes three women ?? One to inflate it unnecessarily and clearly on the exterior of the Circus Cicus building, and one to form as a waitress just to blow up its cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand up to reveal its cleavage. That's pretty much it. Complex, huh? Unlike Stella Stevens and her breasts above, the other women who participated in the plot are not particularly forgotten. Participated in the Las Vegas Championship Lady Stewart Whitman. When Stevens is not penetrated, his participation in the film is highlighted by one of the most stupid artillery battles ever seen in the film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. She feels that the 70s I feel I always enjoy and have some nice footage of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is so boring that the rate is any higher than 4/10? This may be overstated. In the end, the Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some pretty good divisions.
