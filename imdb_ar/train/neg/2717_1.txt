Do we really need more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am prosperous, but while all the "ideal young people" in the 1960s read Marx, burn their cards, and generally extend the war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in primary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just fools, they believed in anything as long as it was devastating. <br /> <br /> This is just another exercise of self-importance from children who have never really grown.
