The film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, directors and editors left this film very seriously. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the book, it could have been good. Wooden representation, very few authentic characters. <br /> <br /> Whoever edited this obviously knows some new editing techniques and wants to publish them all over the film. There are a lot of quick "brilliant" adjustments in almost every scene, which are obviously meant to be symbolic but ended up being annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this film and I expected there would be a decent decision to break the balance, but unfortunately, let me feel I was wasting my time and filmmakers have lost their money.
