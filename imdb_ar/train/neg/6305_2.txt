This is a wonderful story and it was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on that). However, although this is true, it is still a film and this is a movie site. I realize that independent films have trouble getting good actors, but wow. The only mediocre is Oise Davis is excellent. But even he could not compensate all the actors (including the one who plays his role as a young man), which is a terrible act. Granted the script was grossly vulgar, but even then you should get some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anyone because it is very poorly done in every category. Read some books about the real story of the American Mason, because it gives these men the respect they deserve.
