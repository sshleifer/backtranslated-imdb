This was a great movie the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into an eccentric Latin woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo turned in Japan to Carson, California. Instead of the quiet and silent conversations we enjoyed in translation, we get 10 meaningless elements in the mood. Instead of the characters who were as thoughtful and exploratory as in translation, we get characters who give meaningless advice on topics they have no idea about. How can a person wearing a hundred dollars of t-shirts that did not exist in a multi-department store expect a working-class woman's advice on how to prepare for an interview as an administrative assistant? I do not think this prevents him. If he does not give her clothes advice, he tells her what to eat. The most disturbing part of the film for me is how they were supposed to be in a hurry to set an appointment, yet the characters continue to find time to run another task, whether they wash the car or stop at Arby's, or just extend the list to 10 items or Less lists of things they love and hate. I just wanted to shout at them, "Do not you say you have a place, what do you do?" About a minute ago, you've eaten roast beef and thought about your life! " Until I saw this movie, I did not really understand how anything "insist on itself", but I think this film does it perfectly and is not worth it. Dialogue makes the characters cheesy and non-sympathetic? Except that I regretted both representatives for signing this draft.
