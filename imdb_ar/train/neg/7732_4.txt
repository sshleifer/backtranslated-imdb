Before writing this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This film was especially disappointing for me, because it includes two of my favorite dancers, Jeanne Kelly and George Chakiris, who are superior to Guthering Heights, Ice Station Zebra, The Thomas Crowne Affair, The dance was simple, unpaid and non-original, the songs memorable, the story a joke, even the costumes were not particularly seductive, only photography correctly captured the mood and the spirit.I am happy because others enjoyed "The Girls Girls of Rochefort" Although I definitely did not enjoy it.
