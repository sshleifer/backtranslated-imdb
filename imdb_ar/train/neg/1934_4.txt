Following the usual formula for recruiting a new recruits - this time the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman abolishes discrimination against the armed forces - through the US Navy Deep Sea Diver Training Program run by a racist fanatic (Robert De Niro) . If the program is not bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the offers. Robert de Niro activates his southern accent and chirps. Cuba Gooding, raised by a cruel father as a poor black farm boy in the south, is the model of uprightness expected. Girls - we can hardly call them women - Charlize Theron and Lunette Mackey. They have minor roles and are often present to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have more wonderful roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. The vessel is called a boat. Robert De Niro enlists at home, revealing. After a brutal attack on hospital staff, he was taken from his clothes instead of caught. Someone yells "I'm here" in the early 1950s. (It may have been a common expression at the time, if so, "bad.") People talk to one another by rank - lieutenant, mate potsoin, commander, as they do in the army, "Master" (if an officer) or directed by the surname (if recruited). I did not have to check whether there was a rank called "Chief Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a difficult dispute. It seems that everyone in the Navy hates Negroes except for one man from Wisconsin. He stammers and despises others in his chapter. It's like the scene at Animal House, where an applicant for Tony's brothers is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a recruit, a trivial officer of the second order. He managed to marry a beautiful woman who just graduated from medical school. In one of their arguments pleading with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he has to join her and leave the navy and live a quiet life. "Just let life pass you by?" Yes really. Yes, just be a doctor's wife and let life pass you by. You can wave them from the golf course at Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These types of clicks were common enough in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", this thing. As cheap as they often have, they have some educational features. I learned something about becoming a Bombardier or an artillery. Here, the technical details are skipped, perhaps because the author knew nothing about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what was going on during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this would not exist. If I get mechanical problems correctly, it is because I guessed correctly. The trend does not help as well. The film abounds closely, as many of them lose any dramatic impact they may have. Emergencies are confusing because they are not focused. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Want to see a better example of this kind of film? Almost any will do - except perhaps "G. I. Jane", where the hero who mistreated him is heroin. Try the training camp scenes in "The Young Lions". There is a Jewish victim. Or try "from here to eternity", where sympathy buttons are not easily pressed and the victim is a nami who refuses to bend and is active in causing conflict, such as "Cool Hand Luke". No easy excuses are offered, because the excuses are very easy. <br /> <br /> Equation is perfect and not good.
