I'm a fan of Colombo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oscar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was nonexistent. The original plans of the plot and the plot were clear and can be guessed in advance, even years before the modern detective displays of the day. But it was interesting to see the crazy couch styles, "modern" electronics, and, of course, the mandatory humor in the suburbs that you enjoy in modern art for sale. A high-tech home is a copy of Jetson or Disney of Tomorrowland, and fun to think about inventing the book for these "exit tools". <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play, because there are the best Colombo rings. However, we must be thankful for cable television to broadcast these episodes.
