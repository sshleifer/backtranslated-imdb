Alan Rudolph is a great director, without that special touch. For example, there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which can reflect the full relationship between husband and wife. Rudolf wasted it. The camera in the hallway looks through the doors of the dental offices, with Dana and Dave in their own rooms. You get the idea of ​​ruin and isolation, but not much more. Brightness, color, body language and facial expressions could be greatly improved. If I were going out, I would spend every day, if necessary, to get that right shot. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express a lot, a full life, in seconds. <br /> <br /> It was possible to improve the shot in which the little boy was puking. The child should have been more dazzled with the pond, and must have stepped and mixed her feet, and had bowed her head down to look at the pool with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays an unusual, true man, but instead of conveying the inner turmoil in sound, gestures and body movement, the film relies on the narrative and dialogue with his fantasy eternal magnetism, played by Dennis Leary.
