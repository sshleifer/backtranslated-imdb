Another movie based on a vulgar cliche of the crazy world is becoming crazier. The film revolves around a surgeon whose life aspires to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you have not heard it before! Of course, as all these films go, the experience is a lot wrong and causes a bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you think it will at least be a bit suspicious. Error. Like many movies in this era, the idea was great, but the implementation and the script were average. Not the worst horror film I have seen (no, shaded: still the evil maker 2 takes the cake) ... but not one of the jewels either.
