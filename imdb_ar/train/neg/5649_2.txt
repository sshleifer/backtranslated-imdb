I do not think this is too bad in the show under the right circumstances. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation about lawyers are not really lawyers. God forbid anyone actually going to law school based on these presentations, which I heard was the case when I watched some interviews in the program. This has made me just a little silent. <br /> <br /> Besides, Spyder and Schattner, who are supposed to be stars of the show, are the most disturbing. Although this may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not here. Their harassment constantly for women in the program funny at first. But since this is what they literally do all the time, I realize that this is as deep as the show. The attempt to understand some of the dangerous, dramatic and even tearful moments in the middle of this irony of the real show failed to compensate for the gradual loss of attention I had suffered from his experience of enjoying the show. <br /> <br /> Allan Shore's vague and unwarranted "public service announcements" emanating from his views are not admirable. Denny Crane is just annoying. I felt embarrassed for him and the book's presentation of Crane's speech in colonial costume. <br /> <br /> I have given two stars because there are moments when I thought that the presentation attempts to deal with some contemporary issues have been done with caution. <br /> <br /> I think the book of the exhibition has come to realize that the sexual harassment that Denny and Alan have shown has begun to be overstated even for those who have been more invited from the start. The thing, I do not care whether the treatment of sexual harassment in the show is done well, but I just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificial sex instincts throughout the show in the hope that the sexual desire would keep me coming back for more. I am no longer a teenager, and I think this is a promising proposition if it is not to meet the lowest common denominator for obtaining ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course, I write this after I realized that it really would not get much better than this. It's a shame because it's one of the shows I love.
