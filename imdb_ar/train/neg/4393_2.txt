I did not like Frosty's return and this one. Both films are silly with badly written characters and bad voices. Sounds could have been done but Frosty's return was even worse because of the snowman who did not distinguish him. Winterwonder's land was frosty frosty as well as original intimate drama. The only good thing about this movie is Frosty, Snowman was similar in the classic sixties and funny line like when they were talking about unreal things then Frosty walks by the window and worries, they snoop everything he does but everything else was badly written and poorly animated , And barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover in the library about two or three years ago, and the art was so heavy, so I did not get it this year because the pictures on the back were a little moving but I played this movie. I've had very bad technical characters like the DVD and it was awesome about what's going on. I watched this at night and found it boring to be asleep on everything (wait, I always do it when I watch something while I go to sleep) but this movie was boring in general. Overall rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> This is like a bad rift on another holiday in lukewarm returns and this one. This one is a very bad sequel like home alone 4 Well I think the movie was OK but the house alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad house alone 3 and 4 people hate like this. You did not see my sister that much because when I entered my room to watch two and a half minutes, I walked away like "I hate animation!" I agree with them just like Frosty's third return. Awful normal!
