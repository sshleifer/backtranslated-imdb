This movie was stolen when I was a college student. I tried to watch it three times, and the second because the friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I have never heard of this film, but since it's very funny, it has to be funny." Error! I can not make myself see this pile of nonsense after the boxing war / insulting war, where burning a man with a good zinger causes physical pain to your opponent. You may think that the terrible comedy that is hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you will know it is true. This film is not worth the price you paid for it. I've seen a lot of Steven Segal films, and I've seen the road junction twice ... but I still can not see it.
