This film deals with child abduction from the point of view of my mother (Lisa Hartman Black) who works as a man in a thriller. Unlike other films focusing on the police, my mother tracks her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Before catching up with her son in the end, a lot of strange things happen. My mother tries to take a child like her son from a local play for children in a community theater. Stuck, then realize that it is not her child. This alone would have put most people in a mental ward or a few months in jail awaiting trial. However, in this film, my mother is released after a few hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her. Shortly afterwards, my mother broke into her mother-in-law's house and then the police arrived with her guns in their direction, but they left her fleeing because they knew her (and feel sorry for her). <br /> <br /> At another stage of the story, they found the child, but when the police arrived to search the house, it turned out they had left the back door and entered the river on a boat that seemed to have always kept around such an emergency escape! The mother gets someone to lend her a large group, and although it takes some time (in real world), she and her lawyer friend, the police catch the other raft very quickly and are inverted in water by land. Instead of getting out of the raft to look for my father on the ground, my mother assumes that the boy is drowning as she jumps into the water when she sees his life jacket. Of course, she can not swim and sink like a rock. The lawyer saves her, but they miss the chance to flee after my father. At one point, she was told that her son had died in a clinic in Mexico. On it goes, and where no one stops knows! In some ways, this film really exploits kidnap and not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman doing all the crazy things men did in this kind of movies was fun (or funny?).
