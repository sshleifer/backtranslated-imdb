I despise horror movies, this is no secret. There is no conspiracy, misconduct and gallons of blood are the mainstays of these errors in the cinema, this "film" is no exception. I can not believe some cable stations run this garbage already. (This special trash was released directly to the video, as I recall.) It was also mentioned that any other film would be a great insult to this other film, I say this: All Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy films can be summarized as Chucky movies and most Michael Myers movies Single: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
