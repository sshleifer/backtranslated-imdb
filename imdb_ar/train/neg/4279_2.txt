I found a DVD entitled "I Dream Of Jeanie" in a $ 1.00 box at Wal-Mart. When I saw it was the "Stephen Foster Story," being a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year I made it because it did not say it on the cover, only it was a remake of the Sieni River of 1939. Bill Shirley's portrayal of the author is sometimes painful, and sometimes funny. The man has no testosterone and is cheating all the way! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster thinks the music publishers were serving him by publishing his songs ... without paying for it! In addition to this ridiculous idea, there is a clip of almost 20 minutes from Ray Middleton and his songs "Christie Minstrels" with the black face that lead songs of Stephen Foster, which was difficult to see, at the very least. I can hardly believe that anyone would consider this film suitable for the Baath at this time. It is embarrassing and must remain forgotten. Fortunately, Steven Foster's songs will never forget .... Also, Elaine Christie's image of Jenny was definitely the highest point in this lowest point in the history of Hollywood.
