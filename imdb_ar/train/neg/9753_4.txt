I am grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yay!!! This program summed up the extent to which Victoria Beckham obsessed with complaining to herself and her family to the media in the name of self-promotion and "Brand f * cking Beckham." <br /> <br /> A few years ago I used to really like Posh and Becks, and I still admire David's talent, but I no longer respect him. How can you respect someone who recently paid his wife's hand and works with him as a doll? <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was on Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened in Real Madrid. I hope that Beckham can live with the fact that although he may earn millions of pounds, he has sold his soul to the American Pac and will end his days playing with a team that is struggling for a promotion from the Premier League in England - But in baseball and basketball, you control - football you do not!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I digress. It has been years since I saw such a super-flawed performance of 'Posh' - this was unprecedented only during her performances that wore the red carpet after the "disaster" of Rebecca Loos, when instead of throwing it completely * in the David it deserves, clung to Desperate for his arm in an attempt to save millions of pounds of her marriage. <br /> <br /> The entire PR trick was pathetic. Why can not she go there quietly, supporting her husband through the biggest mistake of his career and putting it in her head? When did she become so full of self-importance that she felt that the move to America should be covered by the huge fan fare? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he retained fragments of grace and humility. Two things his wife can do with learning. <br /> <br /> There's something else in Victoria - you complain about being constantly exposed to deals. Little hint - stop telling them where you are, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America!
