I did not agree with any of the Divinity in the Left Behind series, but nevertheless I found books reading and reading 8 out of 12. Good writing is undoubtedly an interesting story. However, I did not have high expectations for the film. Hollywood could not have taken a mainstream Christian series and produced a big-budget film. It was done independently ... and I felt like I was watching a really long television program. She did not feel like a movie only. She did not have the "experience" of the film, if anyone knew what I was talking about. So the film suffered because of that, and the poor, low-budget special effects were another insult to me. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I feel that Gordon Corrie was a very bad man like Nicole Carpathia. When reading the book, it was my impression of NC that he was supposed to be this charming, stunning, surprisingly handsome man who spoke English with almost no trace of accents. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in this role. Instead, they found some folds of Clay Aiken pencil that seemed to be the employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a very bad fake tone. So I lost some stars for me there. The film is not convincing when the main villain does not seem or looks as it was supposed to. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, but nothing was written about the house. Some scenes - like a conversion scene (I do not remember you) - were the real seatbelt for me. And some Christian rock music or whatever, were really misplaced for some scenes, as was the case with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad film, but he did not do it for me. Stick to the book, people, is much better.
