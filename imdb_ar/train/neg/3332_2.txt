I bought this movie when I sold a car, so I did not expect it to be a horror film at the same level as A Nightmare in Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I thought it would still be fun to watch. However, it proved to be no fun at all, but instead, public representation and cinema were capable of ridicule, such as the ways the "invisible killer" killed his victims and how all the people killed killed only a small blonde woman. It was a typical horror film. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women in danger, the majority is killed. 2) One survives the crawling in the dark while being pursued by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, helped to reach the shape of a gun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, two strange hours saved you by summarizing this bad excuse for a horror film, so you're lucky enough that you do not have to watch it.
