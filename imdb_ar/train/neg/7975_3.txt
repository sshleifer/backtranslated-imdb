As I sat in front of the television watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DiBalma, could not do that!" Chances are, you will too. Do not start curious. A Los Angeles park guard (Colin Firth) marries a pretty brunette (Lisa Zani) who has just met her in a park. Then, someday they disappear. The police are unable to find any documents they have ever existed, and Firth conducts his own research. So far, so good. Just as he is about to surrender, he resorts to his best friend to the woman (Billy Zan), stumbling into her former life in the malignant underworld of drugs, nightclubs and filmmaking, and then to her history of mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger, and the film collapses. None of the characters from the past Lisa Zin interesting remotely. The movie moves slowly, and there is little work. There is a sub-scheme on drug money, but it's just a game. No chases, no cliffhanging sequences, no suspense. Just some boring batting and lots of chatting by boring characters. One thing worth mentioning, Lisa Zani and Billy Zani are brothers and sisters, but they did not appear in a scene together. By the end of the movie, you are confused between wondering what you might be trying to stay awake.
