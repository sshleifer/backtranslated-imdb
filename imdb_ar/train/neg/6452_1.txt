You know the story .. The little kids are alone in the forest, when BAM starts! Something cuts them off. <br /> <br /> Well, this foolishness is no different. There are a handful of children returning to the cabin where the twin male driving has disappeared his brother for years before. Suddenly "unknown stars" cut them off, their only help being the doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie was bad, it's an understatement, it's ridiculous! The representation was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very cowardly. And as all the movies do these days, they try to get crooked ends, which they do not do! <br /> <br /> There is one bright spot for this movie - LOST star Maggie Grace as a female leader.
