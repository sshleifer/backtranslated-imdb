Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this movie but I only got a chance recently. I had great hopes of seeing something interesting from Hans Kamal, what I saw was a bunch of corners of a garbage camera mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was but the insulting Hinduism. I am much like the type of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hassan was a man of low character who organized this kind of thinking. He could have made a horror film of this nonsense. Try to add a Hollywood type of virus and God forbid that he did not turn this man into a mutant and eventually will go to dominate the world. This is a film that is much more appropriate for the film school than for the average audience. Shame on him for not carrying the talent that he has. The beginning of the story I tried to mess up ideas from the butterfly effect, then between the little religious harmony at the expense of insulting Hinduism (again, insulting Hinduism more but this film is not equal and insulting to religion in general which may be this one intellectual film.)
