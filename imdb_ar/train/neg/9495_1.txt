It's a terrible film, and there is not one scene that has an ounce of sincere passion. The characters are unprepared, clearly painted, predictable, and a clear and typical storyline to perform the wishes of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> William Holden (very sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when the film was made, but he plays someone in his early 40s, apparently in his 60s. Kai Linz was 20 years old and was written to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was more sexier and had more of a life than their exciting relationship. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - at the same age as Clint Eastwood when he took out the film, (no) coincidentally - was put with clear decorations from the 60s before the cool hippie: single-handed pillow, Hi-Fi swings, and lunches in Yamashiro. But the film is not ridiculously ironic, a silent film of old batons, wishing that the free spirits they saw at sunset and the Laurel Canyon would find it and their big Honkin cars exciting. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture has never been desperate. I was thrilled to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for young people that he was involved in this awkward part.
