Having enjoyed Mr. Brussnan's performance as an instrument in "The Tailor of Panama" (I estimate 10/10 in all areas: acting, acting, script, story, editing, speed, music, emotional impact, etc.), I eagerly anticipated this film. I was very disappointed. It is a text that does not read a film, vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in every way that the Panama tailor is rich and satisfactory. Blame the writing screen and direction. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part"; did not come I did not laugh or cry, although the first line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? barely.
