A terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here, he gets involved with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome is soon set to see what happened to the woman. Of course, it's the woman under the sea. Soon her roommate, Lenny Kazan, died on the floor. <br /> <br /> The elderly Richard Conte plays a police officer and a friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, Rome is blamed and there is an interesting chase scene. This is how bad this picture is if you rely on a chase scene to provide the event. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch play beauty up her neck in the intrigue. Her acting leads a lot to the desired level. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired commander whose son is trying to overcome him. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, you do not know why the girl was killed. Do not cost yourself the trouble of asking.
