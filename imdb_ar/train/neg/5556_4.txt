In the first 17 minutes directed by Bradford Mae, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die", we have already come up with a ridiculous and sounding accompaniment in the first two films, hilarious, about three minutes of footage from the second film and slightly revised to look like new footage, Titled and tormented about Universal Theme Parks- Universal being the company that distributed this film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is a big bunch when it comes to cheap cash flows on the success of a previous film. <br /> <br /> This time, the mutilated anti-house Betton Westlake (aka "Darkman", portrayed by actor "Mummy" Arnold Fuslo) horns with the wicked crime man and his poor wife Peter Rucker (who played brilliantly by Jeff Fahey), and throughout the 87-minute film grows to develop the emotion of the wife and daughter of Rucker, and once again learns the care of another person. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically just a silly way for the studio to make more money than the original Sam Remy movie, which I consider to be an unbelievably great film. <br /> Oh yeah, there are also a number of silly sub plots, including the villain who supposedly was an original doctor to save Darkman after his scars, and seduced our hero to think of her as an ally before being revealed. An evil plot to help Rucker create human-powered thugs like Drakman. Apparently, she can not just do the same thing to the thugs she did on Darkman. why? I can not explain it really, because the film does not show it for sure. <br /> <br /> There is also a sub-plot of assassinations that includes a "local journey" that threatens to bring down Rooker and some very silly things. Happen or occur. <br /> <br /> But it does not add up. It looks like two or three episodes of a television show that were edited together more than a real movie. The direction turns between a good and frank dirty (a scene in which Darkman rides his train-like car and avoids a silly rocket launcher), and editing is a mixed bag. The film moves so fast that nobody cares what happens. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this film, indeed, the entire series is only somewhat ... I do not know ... 15 minutes of mixed bag shots. <br /> <br /> In fact, commenting on editing, one of the favorite things in this movie is watching reusable footage from previous movies, then searching for footage within this movie is repeated several times. Yes, this is cheap. One of the things to do at the beginning of a movie is to repeat a shot or two, but in large size they do it (minutes of footage repeated from previous movies), it's just dirty and amateur. <br /> <br /> Also, I must say that the amazing montage entanglements in the Darkman movie are a little overpriced in this film. It is simplified and exaggerated to the point where it works, but only in light doses and in the right context, as did Raimi in the original film. Here, there are at least four or five people, and are surprised and ambiguous. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not without some good points. A few scenes work well. Clichman's story, which Darkman craves for real life, works well for a direct DVD feature. Some of the acting is cute, especially from Rucker's wife, who was portrayed by beautiful Roxanne Dawson. Also, although there is no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes some gentle music that springs from the original features of Elfman. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very fast, cheap and silly and can not be taken seriously. Arnold Fuslo seems bored and full of vitality from one scene to another, and Fahi, while the joy of being seen as a villain is not entirely in line with the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I would recommend this to origin lovers, who will definitely get to laugh. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. Four out of ten.
