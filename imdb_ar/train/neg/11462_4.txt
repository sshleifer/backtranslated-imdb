I love monster movies, generally. Even if it is unreasonable and ridiculous. But it is hard to like this film when it is unreasonable and silly and tries to take itself seriously at the same time. As in a really wonderful way. <br /> <br /> While the idea is somewhat realistic, like Orcas known for killing great white sharks, it's really hard to find them scary when I can only see an angry shampoo destroying things. Especially as one scene in which a building exploded because of Orca ... As it explodes, the thing jumped out of the water and I felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. They also kill many scary moments before they hint that they will. Furthermore, it requires some jabs in JAWS. It's like "Look, we're realistic and we can find better reasons to attack Orca." <br /> <br /> Yes you are, ignoring your outrageous cries in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing that did not contain your film. it's scary. Yes its unreasonable. Yes its fairly outrageous. But quite frankly, factual or not, Killer Shark is not nearly as scary as White Great. Poor people's efforts to develop personality and writing hurt her more. Even the jaw of revenge is more terrifying than this.
