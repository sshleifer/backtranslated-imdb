It's not bad, but it's not good. It's just amusing. <br /> <br /> As a comedy it's supposed to be, it's horrible. There is not much laughter at all since every joke in the movie has been done a million times before. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that all the actors in the film are usually cool, but none of them really do much. The end is sucked.
