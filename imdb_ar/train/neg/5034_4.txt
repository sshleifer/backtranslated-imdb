I am very surprised to see this high rating of this film, and it is a few opinions that must be positive. I saw the film and was very disappointed. I did not find her very enjoyable at all. It was slow and lacking in entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are dim, with real close-up shots of the public stabbing that do not look good at all. In fact, the wonderful supposed end is not great, I saw it coming, and then the end seemed to look trite. This movie may not mention much, but with the little it gets, it's overpriced. I do not recommend this movie.
