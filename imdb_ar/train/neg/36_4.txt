This movie looked so long in just 75 minutes. The problem of jungle horror films is that there are always lots of footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or a lake) to get rid of running time. The film is worth watching the original laughable zombie, large eyes and bloody eyes always accompanied by soundtrack with intense breathing and a lot of hesitation. Eurotrash fans will be very impressed by bad English dubbing, free female flesh and very silly make-up tasks on the monster and local additions. For the dust through the zombie / cannibal, it was very light on the gums, but I may not have seen an unbroken version.
