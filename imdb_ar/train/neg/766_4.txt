Every time the story of Colombo deviates from the familiar plot (the colored killer commits the crime, Colombo smokes the murderer, Colombo becomes a scourge in this process), the writers somehow will never be able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This loop deviates at its maximum, and the result is a great fluctuation. <br /> <br /> Do you believe: Colombo does not face the villain until the end? !! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we made from reviewers who appointed themselves !!!
