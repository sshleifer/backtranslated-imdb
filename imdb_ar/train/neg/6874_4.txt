Jean-Marc Bar (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange film which is the second part of a kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this film is part of the Dogma '95 statement, although it really seems. I'm not really sure what I'm thinking about in this film. All the actors are good. They offer very good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is interesting in one way or another. But I do not know, there is something about the film do not like. Sex scenes are too long. It moves from an interesting artwork to an exciting piece of crap that I do not know exactly where to stand. It is certainly not a bad film, but I will not suggest people see it and I will not tell them not to see it. Just do as you want. If you're curious and you're open, try it, you might want to.
