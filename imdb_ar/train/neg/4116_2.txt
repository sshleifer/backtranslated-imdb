Each summary should explain to me one line, but I will see it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the show, it seemed like an oversized soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, such as "Big One" that appeared through the middle of the movie, but, what's this? And the earthquake * Moments *, wait a moment! This is Dante Rush! Well, part of it and plate were cut. I can not believe how weak this film is, "borrowing" scenes from other films much better. One wonders what the director thought the viewers were stupid enough to believe there were large, wooded mountain backgrounds in downtown Los Angeles, not Dante's Beck. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget Bond and I, Nash, in this film and go to the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak by chance.) <br /> <br />
