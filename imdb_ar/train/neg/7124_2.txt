A man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife died because of an "accident". His new wife has been released from the Foundation and she is also very rich! Suddenly she heard voices and saw skulls everywhere. Is she crazy again or is the first wife back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You may have guessed the end, so I will not talk about it. I have seen this many times in Saturday afternoon TV as a child. At that time, I loved it but I was young. Now see how bad he is. He behaves terribly, badly written, very boring (even in one hour) and has a large number of five people (one of whom is the director)! She still has some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit creepy, and the wonderful atmosphere of the huge empty house and ponds is close to the atmosphere. There are also a few scary moments (I jumped a little when I saw the first skull) and the end was fairly effective. All in all is definitely not a good film ... but not a complete disaster as well. She has the following small cult. Give it a try. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in version (associated with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It's in great shape with bumps and scratches everywhere. This did not look bad on TV!
