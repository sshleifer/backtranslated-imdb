It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making films. It gets worse every time. Nicky and Flo (2003) stab a frustrating camera. Unfortunately, among the many films produced annually in Romania, the worst will be sent abroad (such as the Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, representation or scenario is a waste of time and money. Result: 0.02 of 10.
