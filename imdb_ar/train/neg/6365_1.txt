Wow, I knew this movie would be bad but not bad. Followed by simplified comments. <br /> <br /> Rudy Rudy Piper is a retired sick sweet cop (Clichy!), helping everyone - smiling like a patient after a delicate surgery passes through the scar on his dead son. His adoptive son returns from the "special operations" of the armed forces and because he "sees things" - his image clings to his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. It is time to clean the streets of another man who was known by Piper and his deceased son (who killed the wicked boy) and his adoptive son. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love interest is a beautiful young lady decides there is no reason to want to jump on the bones of the former army revolution. This happens in about two minutes of a single scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this film, but it is worse than story and acting. All this has been done before, everything has been done better (Ong-Bak is a great example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (the spelling of Americans) and the line of "Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - check out the films of the other director David Worths and you'll soon see why these two films are there, Exceeds 10 years. Some classics such as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - really say it all. <br /> <br /> I will give you Â£ 10 if you do not go to see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - I apologize for not knowing the names of the characters, but tells you something though.
