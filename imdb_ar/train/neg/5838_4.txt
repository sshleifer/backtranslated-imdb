With a crew and very amazing crews, this may be a classic. Instead, it is a repetitive reworking of all conspiracy theories in 1979 about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, who was, in vain, a vague, unambiguous conspiracy about the assassination of 1960's fictional President Keegan. If given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Ellie Wallach, for example, or ask them to go eagerly to the top - John Houston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins are working well in very different ways. <br /> <br /> Photography is wonderful, but it does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of buying a DVD.
