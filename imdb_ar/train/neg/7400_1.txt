I've seen some bad movies, and that's right there. No plot to talk about, it's like one of the bad coma episodes on the soap opera. I just wanted to hit that little girl, well, let's just say, she's really suspicious throughout the film. The monsters around her were wearing bling funny. I've also seen a little Silent Hill there. I read that this was done by, or stared at a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So no wonder it did not make much sense. There seems to be a way to promote there band and nothing more. FX is very good, movie appearance, monsters, and even acting well. But the story and the story of it, not only there.
