This is a classic example of an increasing problem in movies. Why background noise and soundtrack are much louder than dialogue? What does not make sense? This film is not lonely. Most movies seem to be doing it now. For two years, I wondered if there was a fault on my TV, but then I got a new TV there again. Background, the noise that can occur in the city lies behind the actors plunge dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was more disturbing in this film because, in the English version anyway, women are constantly floundering. I kept hoping Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, do you speak or get rid of the marble from your mouth?" If you watch it on a DVD and have French in high school, I recommend the French version with translation. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because Renault was very good in Lyon. People chanted the scenery, but I saw it on television and I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "En".
