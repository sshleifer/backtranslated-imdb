Your story is not the typical patch, not stram pram or rice here. The story of the original vampire really. These vampires are genetic mutations that are not disturbed by sunlight. They are the pure evil of. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. Many actors are clearly amateur. The two leaders who play Van Helsing and bring together the vampire chick are very good. The film is very violent and may annoy some people. It is also full of scientific details that many will find difficult to understand and may be bored. I've been sold on a smart story and good performances for the couple. Do not tell me how this movie can be successful if they have a larger budget and got a big distribution
