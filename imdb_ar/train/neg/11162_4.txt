Jack Black is an annoying character. It's a 14-year-old annoying Eni movie. Do I have to write eight other lines? I de la Riggira do not like to see her, as a Mexican nun who stands in front of her and is rude to Jack Black. This film is PG 13 version of the independent film. I really love a film that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture deeply. I just choke cultural rudeness: Jack Black is just too rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable envoys in Mexican culture, as he was. Mexican wrestling culture is not the most transparent place a white man could seek, like me, I doubt that Mexico is more culturally dark than Jack Black. Presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb is not my review. Has his review been changed to anyone else? just a question.
