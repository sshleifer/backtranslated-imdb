I rented a hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! Try lame stupid in a remote movie. The man who got it in the front was very weak and when he looked (he did too much) he seemed to be eating that little candy ... with his ass! His wolf ties were wonderful, although I felt the actor relied on her very much, as there was nothing threatening his behavior at all. The Native American Native American chick must be one of the most cupping hawks they have encountered. We're talking about a sour cow! I once smiled for the entire film, I think the reason is that she has sex. The sex scene was very lame. They may have shown curtains blowing, if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> And lastly, it's a great hate for pets, on the cover and DVD menu, the digital losers have sharp sharp teeth on the man. Did not exist in the film. :(
