I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I did not hear much about it; only it was a thrilling film, digitally filmed with a very low budget. I was hoping to shoot a big Brit-Flick image coming. But I must say, I was very disappointed. After being shot and accidentally killed, their daughter-in-law was involved in a deadly cat and mouse game when local people decide to take things in their own hands and chase them. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that this is another example of the method of substance in a British film. The camera and editing angles are entirely in conflict with the story, as with the best performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only makes everything that looks like home video expensive. There are repeated attempts to make the film appear animated and brave, which instead comes as joyous and over the top (try out a pathetic psychedelic scene, and countless peeps from the camera). No amount of cliches can hide the fact that this is a very bad story. <br /> <br /> We've seen this kind of thing many times before and made it a hundred times better, especially in John Burman's ingenious "Salvation". But while in the last film, we really cared about people, in this film, I found myself just wanting to be tracked down and killed as soon as possible. Even this was not so bad if their opponents were scary or worthwhile, but instead, they were just a group of typical rural people. Again, vulgar attack, excessively vulgar 'coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers? <br /> <br /> In her defense, "This is not a love song" contains good moments and fun, but it is hard to see this film doing its work. Anything other than going directly to the video or getting a very limited movie version. It's not a patch on last year's budget that was caught in the Hills movie, "Dog Soldiers." Maybe British cinema can actually start again if the right money stops going to the wrong people.
