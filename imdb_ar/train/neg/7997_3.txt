Even for a tired movie model like Nature versus the Human Cycle of the 1970s, ants are far too short to be effective (though entertaining for reasons they did not intend). It's sooooo a joke. It is clear that these ants that are being demolished near the inn have been eating toxic waste for decades and may now adapt by issuing toxic bites - hundreds of these fatal bites. Watching representatives of some malicious reputation amidst small black spots is very funny in a way that is not good but very bad. Many of the scenes seem ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a trash can while being attacked, Susan Summers exclaims horrified as she wiggles in bed, Robert Robertworth and Linda George breathing hard from the wallpaper, Bernie Casey swallows a fake leg. The list goes on and on. The apparent danger ranges from ants and crawling lines of drainage to black ants lines all over the walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Mirena Lowe must be sitting in a wheelchair during this horror. I hope you have found a good benefit for this money, because obviously this is the only reason for having a woman out of this nonsense. Although it is a very bad film, it can be seen - once for me, and has many of those bad qualities in the seventies of the film - actors who began to embarrass themselves, and to feel television, and the terrifying creatures of nature that come back to vengeance on the man. This time the man must push his hand to the pile of ants to be affected. Really very horrible.
