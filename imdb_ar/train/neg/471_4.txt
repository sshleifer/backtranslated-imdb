The story of "ill-suited in the army" is meaningless, which sincerely tries to be surreal (foreign translations) and smells (belly bulging gags), but ends up mixing a variety of different kinds of humor followed by great success. Barbara Bach, a Bond girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. O wasteful! (* 1/2)
