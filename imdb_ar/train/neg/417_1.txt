I access the cinema every week or so and review this site regularly, but I did not have to comment on a movie before. <br /> <br /> To the long list of bad films - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add a group of leadership that was a "hollow man". <br /> <br /> From the horrific opening titles - a long and ironic race of cast and crew with a spaghetti alababeti - to the humiliating end - a world record of cliches and some of the hottest movies and ever acting to get to the cinema - this movie Depressive, impressive computer graphics only prevent you from coming out long before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it is the opinion of my friends and everyone around us. When large segments of the audience laugh and groan during a serious film and after it, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he was also sick. The director took the event beyond the realistic fare limits of a violent film, and to the worlds of more than a blood soaked in film B. It is hard not to imagine the director as a dirty old man, because the invasions of the invisible man outside the laboratory and the outside world only extended to two attempts to feel some breasts. Sex may be the first thing that goes on in a bloke mentality if it becomes invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the women concerned, it hardly makes the cinema entertaining. <br /> <br /> [The spoilers follow] [<br /> <br /> Skip movies from the outside, things are worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of increasingly twisted acting as a "hollow man", the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a script - do a better job than being hollow actors. Once a member of the team is found strangled in a closet by the invisible man, "I've finally taken" ignores one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is the same as the training course, where the lab team swings between horror and total indifference so quickly that it wonders how it works. They walk in the laboratory corridors terrified, and the guns are ready, but seconds later a crew member happily skips down the aisle to get the blood of a painful colleague. The female stealth man behaves gently and humorously even after being insulted and abused. There seems to be little reaction to his escape, even after the head of the Pentagon drowned, "drowned in his bathroom last night." The same female, who surprisingly failed to gather two or two together. <br /> <br /> The script is scattered with this kind of mischievous pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just a cliché of film clichés, which are placed thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and entertainment at the end. <br /> <br /> The moment of "eureka" on the computer, the female who take off her clothes from the window, Security Video Shipped - the list is really endless - the expected disregard of the force in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but only put them in place The imminent death and leaving them on their own devices, the good semi-dead man who appears from nothing to save the woman, the bomb and the human everywhere the timer, the explosion of the fireball that burned before reaching the heroes, the falling elevator that stops before hitting them, Another thing, the immortality of the bad man. <br /> <br /> The unseen man is burnt in shreds with a temporary flame launcher, electrocuted, and blows around her head with a tape he had just slit through a young actor, and then apparently survived the explosion, the ball of fire and the complete destruction For labs, the remaining life is enough to climb through a fireball to another pop in the movie heroes - at this point, the audience swings in disbelief and watches their watches. <br /> <br /> This very bad movie made it really amazing. Even the film's name is as hopeless as the film itself, and does not even come close to the impressive special effects of providing this film, which should be avoided at all costs.
