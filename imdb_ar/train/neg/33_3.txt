This is the worst thing that resulted from the TMNT franchise. I was a kid when this appeared and I still think it was demonic, although I loved the original cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is one scene I remember when a mafia man explains to his followers what the rhetorical questions are. It's awful. Many fans dislike the series because they include a turtle, but that did not bother me. I did not even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it is a pity that can be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is song song. Pleasure guilty, they call ... Nananana Ninja ...
