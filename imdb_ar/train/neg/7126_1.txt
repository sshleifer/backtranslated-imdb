I mean, I think I heard this dialogue in the film, but it was so bad and misplaced that I can not really believe it. I was severely laughing at what should have been the worst book I have ever dealt with in human history. I was very worried about the possibility of a heart attack and I would die there in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I'm talking about, "The Hero" just watched his brother crash and his brother's car exploded there a few meters from him (the hero). The "hero" projected the "convenience" expected to see something very tragic and people were trying to keep him from jogging in the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of his fitness and anger uncontrollable / emotional breakdown says "I'm very sad" - he said that true? Am I crazy?
