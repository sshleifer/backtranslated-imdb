This was not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's as much as it's said. It starts with some good atmosphere. The hospital is sterile and appropriately adapted, the mood is adjusted to "strange". Then ... nothing. Well, something. Just some things that do not fit clearly ... and makes no effort to clarify the relationship between the strange creatures and not particularly disturbing and the hospital they seized. I mean, come on, biker? I watched some teams a lot of Gwar. <br /> <br /> My favorite is the Demon of the Head, who is very much like a middle-aged trucker trying desperately to threaten, while at the same time he seems to prefer to retreat from the Afghan-covered couch, back off his belt, A pack of cheap beer (probably Schlitz), watching the game. Frankly, I've seen the most horrifying truck drivers. In truckstops. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are more caricatured, and even less scary. At least, on DVDs, offering some clarifications about their presence in the hospital ... It seems to sprout randomly in some places, play some annoying "minerals" and cause little death. Except for some good special effects, and the disposition that is not quite terrible due to the lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. It's just a noise in the background.
