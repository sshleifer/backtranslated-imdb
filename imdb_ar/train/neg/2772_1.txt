Spoiler warning. . . I must agree with you, there was almost. This was a bad film, about a real and interesting story. He had such a promise, but acting was ridiculous at best. Some groups were beautiful and realistic. Others are something outside the amusement park. I found myself laughing and watching, what was supposed to be serious scenes. I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. The best part was fighting between friends who ended up with the death of the "king". I loved the Queens penalty. The last shot made a beautiful picture. There are a lot of movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
