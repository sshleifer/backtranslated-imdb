This film was awful, from conception to execution. Does the United States need to create a Star Wars site in this remote country? This is their hypothesis? The United States concludes that the way to get to this game is to win an obstacle course like the cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything about the leader. Is it better to win in this race known as the "game" more than a gymnast? Of course, of course! A gymnast will be the perfect choice for this task. Do not forget that his father was active. We are lucky in our hero, to have gymnastics equipment in lucky places, such as stone horse in the middle of a square (without reason) downtown crazy. Ideal. <br /> <br /> But along with the horrible horrible hypothesis, are the strange statues of romantic scenes, the clearly depressed Ninja that seems to be its only function to take note of the race track, and the worst climax at all. After winning the race, our hero poses the wishes of the US government. Now, all this effort was worth it, because the United States gets the Star Wars website! Cheers Cheers! This is the end of your Trump ?! wow. <br /> <br /> However, being a bad movie, can be a fun viewing. The cover alone, depicting the ninja with machine guns, was enough to persuade me to rent this film. <br /> <br /> But if you ever meet Kurt Thomas (star gymnast) in real life, it's possible that I kicked him in the face after a double flipping with 2 1/2 transitions in the layout mode.
