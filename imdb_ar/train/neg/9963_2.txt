I love Alec Guinness. That says a lot after this film. In fact, it's not bad at that. He seemed to be standing aside, being disgusting and his usual tasty, but Nada invested. It is clear that the girl she meets has a featherweight, even if she is a young inexperienced French girl. Sir Alec did not choose them when he was young and he is obviously not very happy with them now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the exotic brood brother Susan "Alien". Donald aspires to be a French Heathcliff and has waited in vain for its source. What was the mystery of the deep darkness that hid behind that forehead? Did he love the mistress of the father? Why did Suzanne's hair tremble when she conspired to assemble the different parts of this turkey into the rural estate? Or perhaps he simply had enough of her hateful representation. <br /> <br /> The movie was charming with Guiness and the "Great Woman" who remembers Paris and sees it together. It could have been a wonderful story! Two beautifully experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone come out with this? I suggest watching Alec Guinness in "The Card," a well-known but worthwhile film.
