This was a disappointing film. Consider the material --- the army's life is always good for laughter --- and the stars, this movie should have been laughing drops. It was worth a few chuckles, at best. Steve Martin was more fun than this, and Dan Ackroyd seems to have to play exciting roles, where he may follow the lead of Robin Williams and win the day of the Oscars.
