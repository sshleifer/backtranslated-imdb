I was interested in the subject, and only fans who dance Drew Barrymore on David Letterman's office will find anything remotely interesting. Well, some breasts appear (or maybe done by a double body). The plot is broken into bits and the representation is appalling. None of the bullets contain any material that can be worked, as the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. do not waste your time. Watch Donnie Darko instead if you want Drew Barrymore creepy, and if you want to see another movie, go to this and check Darko again. Refer to Charles Williams' "Get Down to Hell" novel to see something worth thinking about instead. This is just an excuse to produce a B movie to go directly to the video and absorb some people in the Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think representation here is commendable? Give me a break.
