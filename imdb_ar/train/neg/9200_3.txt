One wonders how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and other performers do a good job, but because it's not a comedy, a romantic film or anything else, it's rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> One feels like a thread has been followed, and it may be worth it. However, it is interesting to see the real Turkey of a story that was prepared before the United States became directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding policy has to do with trying to make a film for all tastes, but it ended up with something that does not please anyone. <br /> <br /> However, it has historical value.
