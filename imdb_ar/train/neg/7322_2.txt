I will give credit to the balance of the balance, and I say that Linda Fiorentino is doing well as an actress drinking wine and doing what she wants. It's screaming, rude, double-edged, and very sexy; it's much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's all. This dubious, boring film is a fragmentary mess, and it immediately tries to be a stalking, murderous film, a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not very fun. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought of portraying C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leader? He is not ugly, but his screams loudly, it seems as if the goddess Fiorentino is like a cake with a kindergarten teacher. Howell does not have the power or presence on the screen to fill the lead man's role. <br /> <br /> The script is the worst side of the film. There is no tension because Fiorentino's character receives strange phone calls. There is no ambiguity about guilt in the killings that are at the center of the film, and there is no sense of freedom as Fiorentino Hoyle is getting lost. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but poorly executed movies written by Adam You and Isaac Hayes, and a really good sexy scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first payment is to put this unfortunate piece of garbage and rent something else.
