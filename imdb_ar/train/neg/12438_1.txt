Overcoming the bad guys ... Again, represents the tagline of this film, it exposes a lot of truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home alone, two, movie classics. Home alone three and four, a good movie if you three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, it's hard because it's trying to be funny, it's not. Culkin was replaced by Alex D'Linz or anything else. He is a very nice actor with a nice performance, but this is not his fault, he has invited writing to nice expressions and nice expression. The pranks are only copied from the first two with different crooks, and you have to be blind to think that this chickenpox is real. A good choice if you are a pre-school teacher showing this movie on a rainy day. To make matters worse, a completely different team, go to see if you do not believe me, but you will regret it.
