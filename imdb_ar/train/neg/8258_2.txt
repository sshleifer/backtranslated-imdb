It was good to read the book before watching the film. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream gone in the summer, a big potential movie, or a big budget drama. I got in one way or another by one of the hackers, who clearly made notes while watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional observations and low eyebrows. I feel sorry for the actors, because the characters in the book were rich and judicious, but they disappeared into embarrassing characters in the film. Mason Gamble is great when he has the chance, as with Dylan Baker, but the remaining skeleton of the story looks bad after the private school. Poor = good, rich = bad. <br /> <br /> Although it is worth watching to see the South California beach, Gary Senese cuts his piece that is supposed to pass through the Gulf of Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an awkward turn for the first time by Mills Godlo. <br /> <br /> K.
