This movie was terrible. The script is quite unrealistic, but has been written in fact, and the effects of editing and lighting are worse than most of the first projects in the film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone: a) knows any details about the police world or secret operations. B) Know any details about the film industry or its appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to the medium mind or below average, and I think it would be fun if you are stupid. If you have to watch this movie fully, I strongly recommend a kind of ambiguity. <br /> <br /> It is a complete waste of the value of the meager production.
