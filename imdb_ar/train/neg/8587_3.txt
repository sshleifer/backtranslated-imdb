This kind of storytelling is unacceptable and the only reason why there is a movie anywhere higher than 5 stars out of 10 lines is that he put George Lucas behind him and that it contains the words "Star" and "Wars" in his title. This is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others who have made high-definition films with an epic story, writing and acting, but they did not get credit. This is a farce. <br /> <br /> First things first. the story. Anken's evolution? There is no. Apart from a little make-up around the eyes, little shouting, there is nothing. Young, stupid, arrogant Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader in one fell swoop. The only thing that agrees with Darth Vader in the original series is his intelligence, how he was good at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, and naming him. The only consistent thing about Anakin who is seen in the prequel trilogy is his constant stupidity. He even loses his body because of a stupid fit of anger. <br /> <br /> Which part of the emperor Palpatine tells him the myths of Sith does not indicate that the emperor is the Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone flies everywhere like teddy bears in the doll house. Count Doku, Emperor Palpatine, Anken, Obi Wan, almost every digital fighter had a rubber double jump around it. <br /> <br /> In one of the specific combat scenes, Obi Wan and Anakin in the climatic battle, stop in the middle of the barriz and ripostes, twisting the swords several times during the inch. I realized that the battles were determined, but that made me shake my head with disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was awful. All the dialogue was of very low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did their best, but that was not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this film. Too many special effects, and drawing larger openings from the center of the universe, and there are no insights at all for any of the characters. This is the biggest error in this movie: nothing new is being offered. We know the rough picture of everything, all Lucas did is coloring it. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anken had lost his limbs. We knew that Luke and Leah were my brother and sister, and we knew that Luke was the son of Anquin, and we knew that Obi Wan and Yoda were going into exile, and we all knew everything. Nothing new in this movie. If this is all the fans wanted, that's good, because Lucas has made a mistake. <br /> <br /> But when Anquin finally becomes Darth Vader, and asks after Badme, and hears that she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and yells "Noooooooooooooooooooooo." This scene called "B" all the way, and I expected Darth Vader to go "at risk that Robinson would still be dangerous" at any time. That's what it is. B - a huge budget disguised fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two films pull their standards to the ground.
