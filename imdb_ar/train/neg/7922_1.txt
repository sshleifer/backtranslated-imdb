In a place far from the Galaxy is a planet called Sita. It's an indigenous cult of cats. But dog people wage war on these people who love cats and have no choice but to go to the ground and grind people to get food. This is one of the stupidest ideas f # @ k! ng for the movie I saw. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make an incompetent film more than the already low level he put in previous movies. It looks like he enjoys playing in the game of celluloid in the world of oblivion. How low can it go? The only losers in the scenario are the American viewers. Mr. Mikels and his silly little leash have in fact people who still share these waste. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> DVD additions: Commentary by Ted Mikels; The story behind making (9 minutes and a half); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind the scenes footage; Ted Mikkels filmography. And trailers for "The Worm Eaters", "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (Naked), "Orgy of the She Devils" and "The Corpse Grinders"
