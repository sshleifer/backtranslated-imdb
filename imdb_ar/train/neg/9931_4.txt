"Black Angel" is a minor whore, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after being convicted of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Doria (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Laurie has one role to deny on suspicion. This Noir movie looks and plays like a cheap programmer, and achieves nothing special. It's fun enough, but then, at some point, the solution stops, and the puzzle solves one of the big reactions: "Give me a break." This end alone can sink the film completely, but what precedes conclusion is also not good. Vincent is a cowardly hero and Dorioria has never been good at playing good players. I love Noirs movie, but this was a real disappointment.
