I have nothing to do with the political feelings in the film. In fact, they are completely identical to me. What happens to me is the fact that in terms of film, it is stupid and devoid of any form of story, motive or dialogue. Perhaps one should tell Neal that replacing lyrics that fail to inspire anyone outside a dwindling audience is not the same as creating characters motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. There is still a silly story despite Neil Young's iconic legacy. The most childish scene is the scene where the devil dances into a bar, slides down to an unexpected hero, and finds his way to the dance floor to catch the words of Young's heroine, who does not know what a reserved place is. Somehow these dreams come to a scheme where they go to the west coast in search of ????? Sorry Neil, stick with the music and leave the film industry to Steven Stills.
