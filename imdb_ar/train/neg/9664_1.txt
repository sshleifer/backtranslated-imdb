This film-based book is really awful, and very disappointed. We have been waiting for this move for more than a month. Many movie reviewers were optimistic. Also in newspapers and television, he had a great meaning. When April 29 comes, many people unfortunately notice that the film is really shocking. why? First of all, the story was very monotonous. Many scenes were not specific, and sometimes it was difficult to understand what was going on. The actresses, from Holia Afsar, did not harmonize with their roles, especially Feldman Atasper. Behave better in comedy films, in this film, a kind of drama, she could not get rid of her former role. Finally the film is very short, only 66 minutes.
