Here's an indie film I really wanted to admire, but in the end I could not. The absence of text (boldly announced in headlines) appears through the image and kills it. The story is a meaningless mess that does not deserve to be discovered. Soon I was bored within 10 minutes, then I suffered during the remainder of the first 40 minutes - hoping to get the best - before reaching the end of the chapter (fortunately) ... so this was not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying to be smart, raising its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and MATRIX. As a result, there is very little OZARK SAVAGE not done before, which is better. This film was more enjoyable than 10 to 20 minutes, but as an advantage, it feels padded and forced. Of course, there is no money in short pants, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I assumed the motive extends to more than 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinweer promises a great promise, and I wish him success.
