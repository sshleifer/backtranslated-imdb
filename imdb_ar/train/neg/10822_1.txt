Jane Eyre is one of the greatest novels in English and a screenwriter should read them. I hate that when the book uses Spark's notes for everything the novel is about. You can not watch this movie if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> The entire "red room" is so stark that I wonder why even his situation bothers them. In the book, The Red Room foreshadows a complete story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns was treated very badly in the film. I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. The book is one of the most urgent characters and was not the red head. The entire Christian idea is lost in her life and the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Brutty told her brilliantly.
