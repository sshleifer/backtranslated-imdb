I bought this DVD for my brother who is a great fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to see it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It is a reasonably entertaining story that contains two completely separate lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was the most interesting of the two. She plays the role of an emerging Hollywood actress who has had many short-lived relationships. She literally collides with Brian Kerwin (a regular married man with children) after driving her car in the back of his car. After being initially hostile to each other, he is offered leadership of her home because she no longer feels comfortable driving. Romance eventually develops into a tragedy when his wife discovers it. What happens in the end I was not ready, but the slow pace and routine television direction leads to any drama out of the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section includes an old studio instructor played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the best cast with Kenneth McMillan, Louis Shills, Stephen Bauer, and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the head of the studio but in the end when asked to resign, they all realize that their careers will not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Time passes but not all this interesting and I am glad that this is not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Beaver, but she is recognized as the only actor to be seen in this film, and until 1983 she was a decent actress. In general, unless you are a fan, avoid it because it is normal.
