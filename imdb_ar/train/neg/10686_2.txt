Please, Help Economy - Spend Your Money Elsewhere! The film's summary is: The First Lady had been assassinated because he had betrayed her. This is. Without being discovered by anyone, except Cuba and Angie, designed and carried out a large-scale assassination plot unknown to anyone ... and completely unpunished. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly fun: while standing in front of the president, Cuba deviates from the deadly bullet ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watched a movie from a news camera, and they see ... an idea. They are doing their utmost to protect the film, believing that they are the only people who have a copy of this very general film. <br /> <br /> Cuba is talking to a presidential official. PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that there were more than one person. PSM then verifies that the plot includes FBI, CIA and NSA. Oh my God, I wonder that PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms. Archer, First Lady, is a crazy artist. Cuba can not make a painting, and says: "You are very close ... stand back ... look from a different perspective, see from my point of view." Can anyone miss that idea?
