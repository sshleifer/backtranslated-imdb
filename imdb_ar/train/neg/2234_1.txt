I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I realize why. Acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are poor at best. There is no sense to the plot even when you are sober (Warning: I do not recommend watching this movie when you are sober). This movie looks like you're watching a home movie for someone who does not go out very much. It is truly shameful that all the little money spent on this project has gone into such a waste, and I look forward to seeing if any of those who are afflicted still have a career, unlike Eva Longoria who is the only "star" in this film seems That this did not hurt a bad acting stick. I'm sorry because none of these criticisms seem to be constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, do not try again. In the words of squirlyem "a severe shortage of good department."
