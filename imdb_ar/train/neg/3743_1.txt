Jared Diamond explained in the first episode that the other peoples of the world did not have animals to digest but the Europeans did, which explains why we were able to make steel and create complex machines. But then in the third episode, he says: When Europeans arrived in South Africa to the north, they were subjected to the Zulu tribe and other tribes that nurtured livestock and cultivated crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and technical achievement if they have the main things that the author claims are necessary for success? Black slaves) were our greatest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native combatants and 400 non-military South Africans, they can defeat 10,000 of Zulus * without a single victim. In either case, then I think you have to conclude that the germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were successful. <br /> <br /> He says malaria has prevented Europeans from colonizing more of the north, killing thousands of Europeans while not affecting Africans. (I would like to know real numbers but he does not say). Then in the end, he says today that malaria kills thousands of Africans and that's why they can not catch up with us. What is this, Jared? Did malaria help Africans by stopping or harming Europeans? And how did Europe come in spite of the great epidemics throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He is also very keen to say that the reasons the Europeans succeeded were because of stupid luck. Sometimes, when evidence threatens to go beyond his dilapidated theories, he is hesitant to admit that the Europeans may have been successful because they worked for them. It is sad to see this new reality Marxist reality to try to prove his point of view.
