This film makes several mistakes. Few American actors in Spain, Spanish actors speak English. The English language "Spanish" is fine, but the way in which the acting performance makes it all troublesome. The dialogue through the whole script is very weak; it may be Spanish text but it has been translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors who have been forced to learn English. They may be good, but not in this flop. You will discover the movie during the first five minutes, this is pathetic. Then the rest is bad. Much of the waste of time, lots of necessary plots of the United Nations. Oh, did anyone mention Baldwin's in this?
