I do not remember the last time she responded emotionally to her performance as she did with Justin Timberlake at Edison. I became very emotional and wanted to scream with pain, destroy the screen, and accept the cries of hopeless nihilism. Timberlake is a terrible miscast. In fact, his capture is similar to casting Andy Dick to play a leading role in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But that's almost the point. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and will have the same degree of horror in which role. I used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dam Judy Denish. Through his pure palates (small reading), his childish looks and emotional expressions derived from something like "cliche expressions of actors," he poisoned the screen he mercilessly performs, and no matter how they divide it, he will not buy his role as amateur journalist turned to justice for justice. It simply will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone is not responsible for his failure. Director David Burke puts it not only in his primary role but also sets aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Hurd, Dylan McDermott, Carrie Elwes and (I'm surprised he was good). I can imagine a physically physically frail person when I watch Some of these actors interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> There is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there, it sounds like a double comfort. It's a pleasure, if you will. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time on their own, but these ten minutes are amazing, unlike their appearances with our alleged hero. Dylan McDermott is also the same as fresh air. <br /> <br /> But it's enough to knock Timberlake - words are not enough in this particular case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very depraved story too. It is a conspiracy ranging from clichets to a mere nuisance. However, I admire the motive behind his making, which he interpreted as a tribute to films such as Serpico, Donnie Brasco, or even Chinatown. Do not get me - "Edison" does not exist on the same pitch as these films, but I can extend my comment in disbelief to express the reason for his existence, perhaps to justify my sitting in it. <br /> <br /> The text itself has some surprisingly bad writing. Yes, there are some decent exchanges, but it seems that any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is lost here) and Timberlake seems to have come straight out of the Dawson Creek episode. It is your usual dialogue away from reality, let us awaken the dialogue of the public and declare (and fail) dialogue. This dialogue, remember, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - Edison sometimes seems to want to turn into a music video, where passion is not connected to the scene through acting, but through badly selected music and changing film speeds (read movement). Slow). <br /> <br /> When you think about it, Edison is curious. Hell certainly got a crew to kill him but the presentations were marred by Timberlake who simply does not work. In the film as in most works of art, if one thing is extinguished, the whole thing feels. Managers must make difficult choices. David Burke missed the mark here. Some scenes play well in their own right, but as a whole, they do not seem to fit into the puzzles of different puzzles imposed in one incoherent image. And it's not a particularly exciting puzzle to get started.
