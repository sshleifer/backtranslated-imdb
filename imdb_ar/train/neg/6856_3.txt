The film begins with an early scene, advising Frank Morgan not to marry Gary Cooper from his daughter Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing an unabashed gold excavator, loudly complains to Cooper of the tone of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I admire all three actors. Frank Morgan (in my opinion) is a Hollywood treasure, Cooper's legend, and Louise is a very beautiful actress, versatile and understated, rarely seen in a leading role. I do not have anything against Teresa Wright, and although she does not enjoy a large group, she usually offers a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> From the promising opening, the story recedes down to the end. I did not find anything funny about burning Cooper's husband's house. The personal server in such a fast, smoke-free family will never get away from smoking, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or rather, he will certainly provide him with some means to get rid of his inappropriate cigarette. Moreover, no person with any sense of public will be allowed to leave himself carrying a lit cigarette without asking for some means to get rid of it. Finally, no one in his right mind smashes a cigarette into a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gawky. It is a poor decline - misrepresentation and photography in a way that leads to ridicule rather than laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is equally lacking. No one is allowed to perform a full medical examination without being notified of the purpose or giving his consent! That was removed from Cooper's reality to be funny - it's ridiculous! The theft of children from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and this is not laughing. Finally, the scenes of Cooper's intense and nervous interest in feeding his baby and his weight may be irritating to some people who have had anxiety about their newborns. But for me it seems boring and slow. The wardrobe and pillar sections topped the scenes, while, ironically, the screenwriter went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are not in the script to generate humor. They only miss all the CDs. The laughs do not come a mile or so in a minute, but a light year in the minute. The only time the film has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera. <br /> <br /> The scene is completely lost when both Cooper's interests and their lovers are taken care of at the same hotel. Room together. It is likely that there will be a rich amount of humor somewhere in this mine, but none has been extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the beloved girls will be hit. As expected, the character of Anita Louise is exposed to sleep on the night of her wedding! Although it is not on the camera, this is doomed, not particularly funny - even as a loose end. Nothing has been done in this film to make me non-sympathetic (unlike Gail Patrick, for example, in my favorite wife). Thus, I expected (perhaps "hope" to be a better word in the context of the film!) Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending, too. The fact that such a gentle character was basically eliminated at the end of the film really undermines the "happy ending" effect of Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen, for a very distinctive and brilliant dialogue from the movies of the era ... and it was not delivered. Here's a good performance for Frank Morgan in a slightly different role.
