I do not give much credence to the AIDS conspiracy theories, but it is socially interesting to see this phenomenon exciting. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering of paranoia and fear often caused such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexist demography of San Francisco. The city, famed for its beauty, has rarely appeared more horrible than in this film. There is a feeling of darkness and decay in every scene. <br /> <br /> While it can not be said that representation and plot are good in a unique cultural context of movies and dark mood and at least unfairly partially saves the film a complete loss. In fact, I found that the most exciting performance is that Ivy Levy is a barbaric Jewish police detective and ridiculous. It is interesting, although it is not necessarily compelling. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The use of the film for pathetic tragic tragedy is an effective idea and there is a wonderful silent veil for prominent performance artist, Ron Athey.
