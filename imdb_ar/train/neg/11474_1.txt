The remnants of a short film begin with a teenager undergoing an attempt to obtain a driver's license. It quickly turns to every conceivable subject of cars. <br /> <br /> Things like sand dunes, drag races, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. Often you try to be funny, but instead, the film is boring, and even sexually charged. No one in the movie has been heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and voice commentary. Sorry, but I can not afford it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another stupid stuffing to take time in her television show "Disney World". 10/01
