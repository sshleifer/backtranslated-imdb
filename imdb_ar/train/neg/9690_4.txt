Jean Seiberg did not have one atom of acting talent. Like all her films, "Bonjour tristesse" does not suffer at all from her looks (although she may be the first of these contemporary women whom Tom and Levi describe cheerfully as "bisexual boys": of course, propaganda uses the word "gamine") but suffers Sadly the voice of Seberg boring and deadly monotonous. In all her films when she was forced to play anger, Seiberg played an amazing voice and was distracted and panting between her ranting words. Oy. <br /> <br /> Breminger's merciless Francois Sagan's events are a conspicuous plot only because of his filmed cinematic portrayal - but then hard to cling to on the photovoltaic French Riviera, and perhaps for him, but certainly not a pioneer, White and black scenes in the current day that brings us from the novel Seberg routine to the illustrious past. <br /> <br /> Juliette Gr√©co enjoys a brief moment, with a nightclub chorus in the black and white lights, which gives a dark lyric of the title song "Dietrichesque". This moment is at present, retroactively, more than just a little sleep. Except, of course, if you are a Frenchman - especially if you crave French 68h for the glorious days of the barricades revolving around the Sorbonne - and the riots of your children to preserve the chronic effects that have overwhelmed life in France Economy: So you still believe in Chartres, Ambiguous and unqualified. <br /> <br /> David Neven has the toughest role to play, as he has to play with old Judo Cavon, who has not yet realized that life. It's all about Sage Teenybopper's concepts of hip, cool, swing, "mon copain!" Papa. Deborah Kiir presents her usual professional presence in an influential way, playing the role of a woman who suffers unworthyly from jealous young jealousy Seiberg (who meets the shallow teenager Sagan on the classic theme "There can only be one bee queen in the cell"); , For Kerr belongs to the only memorable moment of this film on screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not normal - I agree with a former reviewer who said he seems to be "badly translated" from French; combine the abnormal scripting with the unrivaled, undeniable Seberg monotony and save that valium for another night . Above all, the post-production acoustic dubbing that has been improperly synchronized is quite obvious, and therefore more than disturbing: this is particularly true of the dubbing of Melanie Demonogut because it spoils her very dumb, fun blonde performance. <br /> Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end of the stick here - a very nice-looking guy who also suffered from a less than beautiful, unusual voice which, when coupled with an unmanned Seberg plane, gives unconvincing scenes of puppy love. (Horn, as we say, was only appropriate in "Bridge on the River Kwai", perhaps because its end was suspended by these great film pros William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of not being supported by the unfortunately unhappy Seberg). <br /> <br /> In short, 'Bonjour tristesse' is nice to look at but it is immature shallow soap: a thin porridge with a soaps.
