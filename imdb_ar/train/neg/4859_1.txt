Todd Sheets has to admire his dedication, leadership and enthusiasm when it comes to making films: Between 1985 and 2000, he made 34 big films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy has nothing to do with it, they may all be nonsense (a quick look at IMDb ratings seems to be intuitively verified). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of hateful students who find detention more active than usual after being attacked by hordes of dead neighborhoods, who fled from a highly secret military base located directly under their school. Working out of a terrifying scenario for Brian Eclound (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the bomb f), Director Sheets presents another huge, awkward effort that includes some of the most horrifying performances of the mind from its visual effects, free from the horrific talents and effects (some CGI nonsense and akin to the front of the space shuttle Giant cardboard) and a poor brand (a handful of their tailors were pulled from under the clothes of their victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, after seemingly never seeing the annoying characters working on their lives, and the uninspired people who resist the animal's bowels, the film ends with the end of a twist of travel / paradox that forces viewers to re-watch several tortuous minutes from The beginning of the film. Honestly ... Once was enough, Mr. Shits? What have we done to deserve to have to see it again?
