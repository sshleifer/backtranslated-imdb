The story of Norman McLean is a masterpiece. The film Redford is average. He adds ordinary scenes to the McLean brothers as they flock to the falls and have double dating in a planted bar that is not even hinted at in the story. The code, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul McClellan, an outdoor genius, is either high or depressing, depending on what your original story means. Some pretty fly casting scenes. Tom Skerett as father and Craig Scheffer in Norman Norman's role as male and male, were expected to be men. None of the women had an impression in the film, which is unfortunate, because McLean liked the women in his story and explained this, even poetic.
