I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on reproducing bad films and leaving the classics alone. Can only hope. While this new version was not a complete waste, I still wish I had six dollars to go back to the original DVD. Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I have ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It just repeats why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
