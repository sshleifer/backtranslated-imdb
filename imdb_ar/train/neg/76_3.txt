I saw this in Melbourne premiere <br /> <br /> It's shallow, two-dimensional, unaffected and hard to believe by looking at the subject, boring. The actors are acceptable, but they did not have much to do with the mysterious and ineffective scenario. For those who may be worried that Kelly's daddy may be over-thinking, you can feel comforted by the fact that this novel of the story is completely without any literary depth whatsoever, said entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it does not work as a popcorn film either. Its operating speed is unusual and there is not enough craft to satisfy it even at the level of an ordinary actor. <br /> <br /> I doubt very much that Gregor Jordan can rest and say to himself, "This is the best I could have done with materials." <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a wonderful figure, as well as a national response to it. Perhaps a popular genius, perhaps a class warrior, perhaps mentally unstable and perhaps all these things, has dominated the real Australian legends for over 120 years. Again, his story failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> This is life.
