It seems that this film starts in the middle, presents the peripheral players as if they were important and displays key characters without any background materials and thin and / or impenetrable background. Almost no one has credible or clear motives for their actions in this film. The plots are painful, and in the end do not go anywhere, the dialogue is illogical and vulgar, and the director has a little idea of ​​how to get the best of his representatives. There seems to be almost half of this film, but it never happened. <br /> <br /> We were told that a mysterious pyramid appeared in New York City and that Central Park had become arid land in the Arctic. This, however, does not seem to cause much public concern and is of concern only to the government. <br /> <br /> We are presenting a "wicked company" in eugenics but this is really just a comfortable perception of filling the universe with two power-stumbling disciples. The combined double "eugenics - bad" is heavy hands and never rests here. We are supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough of them to find out why. Much of this world is either underdeveloped or completely underdeveloped, so it runs as a killer runner for an hour and 40 minutes to be raped. <br /> <br /> In the world of "digital" animation created here, I can say that at the same time that this film was made, many other directors did the same with smoother and more believable results. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this movie, the most exciting question remains. In my opinion it was, "What's up?"
