The film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, both professional actors and Mohawban, is a great idea. Independent film looks better. The studios will control less content, allowing actors, writers and directors to be more creative. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so cute? Ask for dust. <br /> <br /> This movie assumes directly that the bat has invested deeply in characters. No one is given an appropriate background story, so we never know why people behave the way they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations of physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have left at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to watch this movie and I thought it was bad. <br /> <br /> Her question: "Not even Colin Farrell can save him?" My answer: "Even Colin Collar can not save him."
