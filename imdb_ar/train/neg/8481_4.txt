The acting was terrible and they got both the wrong sports ....... Not only did they make mistakes in the ski rules, but they also ruled hockey hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey game you can not check. You also do not block someone. Not all of them are disgusting girls mean gross and large. I play hockey at the age of 14 and asked me to go to school like the ones in the film. Also not all hockey players hate skiers. There were a lot of current hockey players in the past. Also we ski much faster then those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the film which gave people the idea that we sneezed ....... although I must mention it is difficult to move between the sport because of the toe pick on the skis ..... also some of those weak moves that was Katalin performed by the ice could not do in a regular hockey game. It basically stumbled person, it is painful. It is also unrealistic that they will get a scholarship from HOCKEY when they are a skate character. It made me very angry that the grant would normally be used by someone who could benefit from the team.
