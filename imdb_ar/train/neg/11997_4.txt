This film has a lot of negative aspects and that's all I can see. It's long painful and awfully oriented. I can see a whole audience running out of patience and waiting for its end. Runtime is over 3 hours which could have been adjusted to less than two hours. <br /> <br /> Moving between stories is average. Most people admitted that they were sitting on seats expecting something better than going out. <br /> <br /> It's funny in the pockets only. Project ambitious and implement par. govinda does a fair job, Anil Kapoor disappointed me, and we comfort as expected. If you expect anything near Babylon or actually love then there is no place nearby.
