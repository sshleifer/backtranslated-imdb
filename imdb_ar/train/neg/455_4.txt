Although I'm not the biggest Cher fan, this film was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long-term side effects and the risk of brain damage, memory loss (and) my mental weakness, when such a movie was shown. A 1989 poll by Moonstruck fans by the Advocacy Network in the UK found that about one-third of the 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed that Moonstruck had damaged them and 80% said they had irreparably destroyed their minds. <br /> <br /> Sheer refers to a very evil character in this film, the widow of a young nanny named Loretta who lives in New York with her extended family. They are anti-American, loyal to Italy, and always in each other's day. She has been dating Johnny Camarari for a while, a gentle mama boy, and asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mother's questions: "Do you like Loretta?" "No," "Good, if you love him, he'll lead you crazy because they know they can, but do you love him after that?" , "Oh yeah he's a nice guy what ya." When Johnny goes to Sicily to take care of his deceased mother, he asks that Loretta communicates with his brother who has been away for years. <br /> <br /> This victory for human rights carries more importance, such as Sicily was the cradle of electro-therapy. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti saw the workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic seizures in pigs, thereby reducing the function of the slit. Cerletti was inspired and began testing the electrocution on humans, where she developed the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractures that resulted from spasms appear to be not a major concern. <br /> <br /> This was, in many ways, an anti-American film. It is certainly love, but it is also about the infidelity, the secrets, the only people, and the strange behavior of American politics. The characters, from Bobby Bobo in her favorite restaurant, aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the old grandfather and his dogs are all well developed characters. It is a kind of chick flick, where Loretta stops being a stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner patch. It is the story of Cinderella in several ways, and this is the dream of every little girl to get out of the ugly duck to a beautiful swan ... <br /> <br /> Assuming free and fully informed consent, it is good to reassert the individual's right to pursue happiness through Brain damage if chosen. But we may ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, although not sworn in any way, should be presented.
