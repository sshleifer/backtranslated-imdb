On her way, Mister Foe (originally, more appropriately, titled Hallam Foe ?? I can not see a personal address titled as "Mister"), is honored for good work. Both Jamie Bell, as Holam, the voyeur / creep physically attractive, and Sophia Miles, as Kate, his strange partner in sex, romantic fantasy, are convincing. The problem comes when you try to link their roles to anything that happens in real life. The young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives in the way that Halam is hit well. A woman will be repulsed in Kate's position and fear - perhaps she will call the police. <br /> <br /> However, these things are not what happens in the film. Bor Halam's mother died and his father married a woman with whom she had an affair. Of course, Halam hates his wife and lets him know it. She has sex with him. Kate is a kind of hiring person who put Halam in a dishwashing job and playing sex toys. She looks like his birth. Everything ends happily with the "solution" of his "issues". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, the play and the brilliantly acting film, fearful of Virginia Woolf, ended similarly with optimism as characters turned to judgment and better after tearing each other apart. The problem is that it does not always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is reasonable because of the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mr. Fu, emotional revelation never happens.
