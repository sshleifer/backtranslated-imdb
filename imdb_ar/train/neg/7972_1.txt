I love movies b ... but come on .... this was not even worth a grade ... the end was stupid ... b / c there was no real end !!! .. Not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... Does not mean lighting storm or crazy demonic powers? Slow like hell, and then they start killing the characters one by one in a 15 minute time ... I will not start by killing a person without his head .... So, you will not even be able to see what the Jigsaw game does even with what Called "New Puzzle" .... unless you have better to do ... Id watch paint dry before Id recommend this movie that God left to anyone else ... oh and to make the best totem the other movie you can see the man Throwing one creature into a scene downstairs from the window ... was funny as hell and maybe the only good part of watching this movie's waste
