Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film very difficult. Maybe because I'm from a different age and a different country, but I found Crosby's persistent references to Good Old USA enjoyable at first, vulgar after a while and then finally annoying. Make no mistake - I am not anti-American at all - but English seems to be unable to do anything right and / or need this brave American visitor to show them on the road. It is the story of "fish out of water," but unlike most films of this kind, this time "fish" is the upper hand. To be fair with both myself and the film, I've seen him a few times over several years and I have the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I watched another film for Crosby last night - Waltz Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in my mind and to my surprise that even my wife - who deserved it American - found that Crosby's attitude is "in your face "One of the many references to Teddy Roosevelt is infuriating. <br /> <br /> As for the premise of the film, it is unique enough for its day and the supporting crew is, of course, very good. The landscape and music are good, as are the brilliant costumes - although I agree with one of the former reviewers that the wig of William Benedix looks awful (Moe of The Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> Everything is all for me, this will be a more enjoyable picture without the Bing Crosby position, but because in almost every shot you can not watch this movie.
