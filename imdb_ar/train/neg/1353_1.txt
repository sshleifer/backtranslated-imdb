What is that? Is a combination of exotic repeated motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastika, and overt racist music, among others) unrestrained by any kind of narration, plot or character development. I was shocked by the whole thing as a "strange offer" self-consciously, and I mean only unusual decisions. He feels a bad acidic journey, far from any level of drug abuse that one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only film I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second favorite film of all time), which was deliberately more frustrating, but I still find what it is? A complete waste of my time. It is one thing that gives me a glimpse of the inner workings of someone else's mind - even someone else's consciousness is not chemically - but something else is just throwing pictures that are purely alien to me.
