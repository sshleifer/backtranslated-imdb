Filmmaking is a difficult job - because decisions have to be taken and everyone concerned has a special life as well. This is the original thesis of this weak attempt in the production of the film "Thaqb" about the film. In fact, there is no better evidence of the industry's stunt than the vision of Anok and Jamie Maximilian are trapped in this madness. The vision consists of talking heads chanting nonsense like "I have to shoot a studio movie that drives a lot or should I make an independent element and stay true to myself in art?" "Do the latter, please." Or: "Our relationship is not only professional, it's also special. "Yes, it's dear." Among the blurred dialogues, one gets glimpses of palm trees, hotel lobbies, and American movie posters (there is no sign of a non-American film on Croisette). Frequent sleep sessions is inevitable, making 100 minutes of film feel like ages. Jenny Gabriel is surprisingly unconvincing in justifying her presence in the frame.
