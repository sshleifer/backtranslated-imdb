My friends can usually carry a lot of hopeless movies, but this film was so bad for us that we could not even see it until the end. It was just boring and not original. Not even the "hot" girls who starred in this film can keep me watching. Everything was predictable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> It was a good acting at times ..... but it was sometimes bad. You must be the most disturbing character in the entire film and you just want to be the best character. Whenever I see him whenever I want to smash my screen. (You know what an ugly child I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> This plot was executed several times before I thought it should be prosecuted by other film companies. Well, it's a good idea, but that's all there was to it. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie can only be seen by yourself, to save any misuse of your friends. Or, if you do not have something better at all.
