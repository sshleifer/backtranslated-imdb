So why does this offer suck? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that it does. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the projection, the string of short-lived cave-dwellers focuses on primitive humans and their struggle for existence in modern America and is based on the characters who appeared in a series of television commercials for Geico Insurance . The concept is strong and there is every reason to believe that it can be successfully implemented. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then the line of description of commercials - something to the effect of "we" is not much different from you "provided me to absorb the show.Although the cavemen Primitives are actually a different kind of human being, the characters of this show's title, as it turned out, are exactly the same as our characters who are boring jerks. <br /> <br /> My background may be like a playwright - rather than an inexperienced writer, from The breakthrough, a California commissioner - but this offer had a lot of potential, none of which was achieved: First of all, the producers had to focus on the lichens <br /> <br /> What could be funny, for example, about giving them careers such as a permanent graduate student and furniture shop clerk, when they were attracted more urgently to things like workers Underground facilities and guides in cave gardens Why do they play unconventional games such as squash, when a full loop can be devoted to them trying to get fishing licenses to follow the game spears? Such a presentation can write itself, and it takes some bad writing deliberately to make it insane and boring to the point Large. <br /> <br /> Another daunting aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cave men as being exposed to the number of stereotypes associated with different humanities. Yawning! This has been done several times before, and no more gloom than this. As we have already noted, primitive humans are really different, so their use as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is unconvincing and unacceptable. Me why I am wrong. I would like to enjoy this offer, and I am sorry that I have not been able to do so yet. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
