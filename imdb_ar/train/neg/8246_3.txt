The girls of Pope Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some wonderful news at the local post office, unaware of the theft by the thief Charles Inselly. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a letter (from the young Robert Haroun) requiring the father to leave the house; therefore, when the young women return, can they be? Home Alone. When the weak pair swallows in the evening, the local "Grand Ball of the Black and Tans" begins; and a dark-skinned mustache gives extra risk to the WWE. Griffith Duo dynamic? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his best roles in autobiography, where he steals the film from "The Girls and Daddy." Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-tailed additions in Black and Tans. The "Biography of the Girls" Lawrence and the West later suggest "Griffiths" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in the "Orphans Storm" (1921); they are overly affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, because the story of the thief who was compensated by saving his potential victims from greater danger is interesting. <br /> <br /> *** The Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inselly
