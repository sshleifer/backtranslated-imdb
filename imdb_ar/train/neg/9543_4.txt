Let's face it - if you hired a STDVD supplement for a forgotten gem in the 1980s, and you expected it to be better than the above, you're stupid. Wargames: The Dead Code joins a long list of unnecessary sequences that have filled the DVD market so easily. Movies like these do not need spoilers, because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets a girl; a girl loves a nerd. The nerd loves the girl. The nerd accidentally misuses the Top Secret Government nerd and a girl who goes to another country. The nerd and girl are eventually persecuted by government suits in the other country; a nerd and a girl meet some important old man who dies at the main point in the "film"; a nerd and a girl are caught. The Top Secret Government becomes a madman; the nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; the nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first movie "Wargames"; the nerd saves the day; gets The nerd has developed. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> The acting, the script, the effects, the result, and the cinematography are what you expect - grade B. There are some familiar faces here, and unless you are a big admirer of Colm Fiori, you should avoid it. Granted, the movie will not make you crazy enough to eat your toes by watching it, so if you love STDVD sequences of cheap appearance, you're at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick was also involved with some "masterpiece", he could not even do a veils five seconds in this one. But can you blame him?
