Only glandular secretions - please do not ask for any other details - for young virgins can keep the body and mind rapidly deteriorating to the family of crazy and freshly hushed horticultural wife. Since most virgins, like most people except those involved in medical experiments, rarely relinquish their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bella Lugosi) arranges for their abduction and preservation. He will do the same extraction. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful cheeseball for the horror horror film, with a low budget. If the Corpse Vanishes turns out to be Havarti's horror, it leaves an interesting taste. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the acting is almost terrible except for the lucky actors enough to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); and the courageous bravery of Brother Angel (Frank Moran) He was very cheerful and had a fetish for the hair of the virgins; the mad mother of two (Urecal); the crazy wife (Elizabeth Russell), who slept in a luxurious coffin, and of course the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> Patricia Hunter (Luna Walters) follows a young Moroccan reporter who is following a doctor because of a strange lizard with a peculiar sweet smell worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay at night, a storm breaks out immediately. This idea tells us that some violent violence is about to break out at home. Since it is known that all unmarried young women in Hollywood at this time were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include the dark corridors, the cortical laboratory where a dead virgin is stored near, the basement shrine, and later, a direct threat to the feces of Patricia Greene. If she survives, what is the story she will have to offer her editor? <br /> <br /> If you try this wet slice of rotting Filveta (and why not? do not be superior), do not judge Bela Lugosi by the company that keeps it here. He had a great influence in Dracula (1931), but his favorite film is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast, he is a sad and ironic man who protects his young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karlov) and begins to move the man alive, ah, well, it is a wonderful sight.
