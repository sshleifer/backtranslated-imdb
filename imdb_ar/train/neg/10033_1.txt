I was very upset by the move. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was not funny, the work was exaggerated, and the songs were unfamiliar. So the story was weightlessness. From a writer who wrote successful texts like Guru and Dom, I had high expectations. The actors worked very hard and the film did not help at all. Of course, Kareena shook the screen in the bikini but for two seconds. I think Indian game managers must find out how action films work. They tend to over-exaggerate way too much. In Chinese movies, this method works because this is their signature piece. But the signature of Indian cinema is the songs. A good motion movie should not last more than two hours and can not seem unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these motion films will become clearer. It should also be noted that comedy and motion films do not mix unless they are done correctly. Good luck next time.
