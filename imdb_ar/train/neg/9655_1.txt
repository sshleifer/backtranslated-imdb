I ended up watching this movie even before reviewing any reviews at the request of a female. Out of curiosity, I think, let me know if there are people who advise others to watch this film. I was quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site which makes me conclude that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I have to ask, "Are those behind-the-scenes filmmakers backward or doing?" They assume that viewers are backward? "The film is outrageous on many levels, and I am not talking about the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> So this group of players plus one girl (the lead actress) form a band; guessing the constant presence of guitars. The hell, when did the dancers start to become part of the rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as a Bollywood version of the rock band, but amazingly all the grades that made these two performers do all kinds of " ROCK GOCKURES "I suppose they were playing instruments, and the guitar voice was completely missing! I simply can not afford it M stupid size here .... <br /> <br /> I will conclude here just because it is definitely not worth pointing out any other drawbacks in the film .. It seems that Bollywood managers have no defect anymore !!!!!!!!
