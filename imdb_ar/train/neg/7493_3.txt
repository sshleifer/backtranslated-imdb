I could not believe my eyes when I saw Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. The Nuremberg trials are a step by step, and the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience can see the most shocking and horrific footage I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important that people see these shots (although I never agree with people who say there is no minimum age for exposure to this type of material), but in this film it was completely ridiculous. Was purely intended to improve the impact of the normal television series. It was supposed to shock the audience which is incredibly cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us with wonderful scenes, inspiring dialogue or interesting perspectives, the public is subjected to horrific torture of prisoners of skin and bone camps. There is no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
