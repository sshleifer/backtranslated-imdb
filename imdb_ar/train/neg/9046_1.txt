Now for the sake of truth, her line is very weak - for Walt Disney's full nonsense. When Robinson appeared, movies everywhere, I was shocked at how poor he was. It's like "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong! It seems as if they lacked mashed ideas and some of the crazy garbage together to try and get rid of them - they do not. After that, I sat there hoping for the end. My younger brother lost interest halfway, and was puzzled by his order. The characters are weak and after the robinsons show you do not care about the end, you just want to finish the movie. It's a movie that forgets, and forgets quickly. If you have some spare time, do not waste it.
