It is always difficult to have a better brother in your life than you always have, always struggling to get out from under this shadow and not leaving the bitterness away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa, and then imagine how difficult it is. This is the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays a unique role, the bitter loser who spends a lot of energy making sure that people do not walk around expecting good things for them or giving his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), very praise because it is simply the lights , Hunger fame, creepy little man who wants to uniquely photographed. After that, you do not know that, Fred needs a financial interest and has to compensate for that by helping his brother in the run-up to Christmas. And the following fun and fun lessons. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what should happen. The fact is that we got a Christmas movie that includes a few good moments of Vaughn's patented fast-talking, a moment of unrivaled music video, and Kevin Spacey plays the role of checker to close the Santa process (one of the weakest villains I have ever seen) ), Not enough of Elizabeth Banks in the lush Christmas clothes, a lot of John Michael Higgins in his personal clothes (to be fair, he's a great figure) and a film that swims a lot in the bitterness to feel good seasonal rest, but you feel comfortable in the last half To feel that you enjoy all the bad things Related to trade at that time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weiss is on the way too, as is Cathy Bates, but she's really just a movie for the iPhone, and if you like his style you'll find something you enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is nothing else recommended for this seasonal smell. Outside the iPhone corrections, the text barely casts anything decent except for a particularly good scene that includes a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dubkin's humble and anonymous approach is like the 20p Christmas card she sends to a aunt she has not seen in 10 years and seems to think that just putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care will ensure Christmas pudding. No, we get a burnt-out block with a lot of sugar on top. Forget this and stick on the hilarious sprite again if you want a great and modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.
