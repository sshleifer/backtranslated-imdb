I read the book Prophecy Prophecy and I was looking forward to seeing the movie. Please be aware that the film loosely depends on the book. Many of the most interesting points in the book do not even appear in the film. It's a movie "B" at best. Many events, personalities, and how the personal interaction and meet in the book are simply changed or not occur. The flow of events in the book is very smooth, volatile and feeding on the presentation as if I were a kid. Personal development is very bad. Character personalities differ from those in the book. Looks like the horror flick "B". I understand that it will take six hours in the film to present everything that exists in the book, but they missed the playing base. The molding was very good.
