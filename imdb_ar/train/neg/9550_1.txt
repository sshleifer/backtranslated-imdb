After Highlander 2 (which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to make a supplement that would make me cry because it was too bad. I was wrong. I liked the original Wargames game, but this film is inaccurate with the details of the computer and details about the original film. The original Wargames had at least some breakthroughs that worked. Everyone who wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she saw the original film. Representation is not convincing. Please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can not turn off the TV. This movie will spoil your life.
