I can not even believe that this offer lasted as long as it continued. I think that's all part of America's decline. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this presentation better when it continued with its original title "Seinfeld". What bothers me more about this show, apart from the obvious sense, the core of "humor", and general intelligence, is the buzzing way of episodes. The great performances are still funny after many repetitive scenes, such as "The Dream in which Rob accidentally sleeps", "Dick Van Dyke's Show," or "Lucy and Ethyl's Show at the Candy Factory." In other words, it's an honor for viewers to see great programs. That the authors and producers of "friends" will have the boundless arrogance to actually name the episodes, and themselves, in such a way, even before anyone has even the opportunity to see them for the second time, not only speaks of the poor and lack of original thought by the authors, Also in the minds of their viewers. <br /> <br /> Read the comments of some of these people and can only conclude that they live in a card resembling Hallmark Neverland, full of greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? Want to live in Manhattan? get up. These people are supposed to work in cafes and look for work as representatives, but they can somehow live for $ 4,000 a month. Apartments? be realistic. All I have to say to those who want to move to Manhattan and live the perfect New York life with Roses and Monkas, and good luck at all. New York does not exist for anyone who earns less than six figures. But good luck with it all, anyway. Now, close and pass from Soma.
