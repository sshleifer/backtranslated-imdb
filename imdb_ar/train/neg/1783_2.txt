There are no spoilers here ... because there is no conspiracy to spoil. Madchen Amick is a living proof that the face can make a living - no talent is needed. The only bright spot is having a few good lines made by Alice Craig very well, but again, Alice is Craig. Her soft, dreamy voice gives the only hint of how dangerous these exotic beings are. It's scary in this incredible plot. How they made it agree to this project is still a mystery. The script writers must have been treated when they sent this script. He has great continuity problems, superficial stereotypes, writing a horror formula, and simply falls short of understanding any meaning at all. Creatures, while having elegant skills such as "bleak", are asked about where they came from and what is never explored. <br /> <br /> Do not waste any time in this one.
