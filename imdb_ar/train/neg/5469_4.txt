This film may have weak production values, but this also makes it good. Special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the film was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. It's very hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Breichard as the leader of the hilarious gang, as well as other members. This film actually tries to raise a point of view, saying that nuclear waste stations are bad. 4/10 Comedy Fair, Total Movie.
