This conspiracy is very manipulative and relies entirely on the most unreasonable and unreasonable decisions adults make in every decision taken by parenting. Children have a great deal of magic and magic, but as I said, the whole plot is based on the fact that every adult is stupid and, in this case, more logical than their actions (and at the same time the only way to explain the behavior of the boys from total distrust). Why do young boys take a sweey kid from the beach? How did the child get to the beach and at the same time was the reason that it was the last place to look? Why are boys never told, instead, at the same time as the child is missing, no one gives touts around them running with food and baby diapers while all the hype goes on and on elsewhere? There is no possible justification for asking the public to believe this. The claim that it will then be prosecuted (even in the informal setting) is an insult that should not take place.
