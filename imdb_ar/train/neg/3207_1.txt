Oh my God this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie takes itself quite seriously ... unless of course it is meant to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Science Fiction Festival and the whole audience was laughing at every scene. I think my favorite is "Should not you study medicine in Uppsalov"! I also think they were trying to figure out how many times they could be crammed into Nicalo's only line. "We'll be together ... it's our destiny." I'm sorry but after the first time, words lost all meanings. <br /> <br /> What was with the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: You can not move, so please do not try. You just embarrass yourselves.
