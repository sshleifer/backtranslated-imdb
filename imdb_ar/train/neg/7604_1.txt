It certainly happens in the West, but the title makes it look like a traditional Western. Instead, it's a film for a decent woman. Make no mistake though this is a bad film about a woman mayor. Become a mayor when her husband is killed; she's just a little upset boy of this. Her main goal is to pursue the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a man to kill her. That's what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Totally stupid, because anyone killed in this film has a new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind the bars, but I think she was loving it she would not do it. Killer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons are also somewhat stupid. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching ... It's not one of the best MST3000 episodes they've created. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it more painful. Kurman is a low budget manager, but so he has to know better than to go people to a place and go out somewhere else.
