Like some of the other people who reviewed this film, I was eased towards it ... before I unfortunately had to see it again. Sadly, the memories of my childhood in this film were not entirely trustworthy, and the "Pauline Risk" has now been revealed as an awkward exercise in boring, racist and boring filmmaking. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not overcome a strange scenario, a terrible thematic song, and some "special effects" miserable. In addition, stereotypes of African and Arabic characters make viewing painful, especially given that this was produced in the wake of the civil rights movement. Michael Weldon's original encyclopedia of psychotropic substances suggests that "Pauline's dangers" were originally produced for television, but ended up in a theatrical version. Based on the results, this scenario is completely believable (and perplexing).
