This is a really miserable little film. It is recognized that the original Holy Trinity was governed by the law of diminishing yields, while the "final conflict" turned into a cynical subterranean midway through the film, apparently to provide unnecessarily committed deaths which now became the main cause of the series "Omen". But then to poke this documentary TV (Beware of the Omen Box buyer on the DVD - do not be fooled by the widescreen of the transfer, this was and still is a very small screen) on the back of a series of generally satanic coolers are unforgivable fine, Was, by producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I will abandon the plot if there is anything, besides the usual death scenes (which have been hopelessly alleviated with regard to television sensitivities) and some of the worst acts I have seen. All the participants in this project should be ashamed to reach the people who feed from this farce that came to the screen, let alone disguise as Omen. If one person is convinced of my review to avoid this mess, I'll feel better.
