There were some low moments in my life, when I was puzzled and gloomy. The Rancid Aluminum was sitting through one of these. <br /> <br /> There were warning signs there. No premiere (even stars do not want to attend) and there are no reviews in magazines. The only reason I was sitting in the movie was hoping that I could catch some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie is explained. The narrative was stupid. I felt exhilarated at one point when the film seemed to have been filmed, and then to my growing despair, it turned out he was not really shot. I sincerely hope that all the participants in the film will be suspended for these atrocities. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, especially moments of unintended humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to manually relieve himself in the toilet, tells the person in the next room by placing his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I must conclude my statement like this. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: For the masters, the waste, the retrograde who want to torture themselves only.
