Before watching this film, please review the online reviews of the film's falsification of events, particularly the widely accepted truths about 7-8,000 Muslim men who were transferred outside Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitary forces. The documentary belongs to many pro-Serb American organizations. Please watch this movie critically and read the reviews in advance. Most of the reviews argue that the documentary takes its arguments away, even if it raises questions aimed at conventional war wisdom. A review by Stephen Holden in The New York Times suggests that "it would be inaccurate to name this pro-Serbian documentary," but one should question the facts, many taken from reliable sources, and overlook those facts that instilled Serbian forces. I do not recommend not watching this documentary, but I warn you to check it with a very critical eye (as one should do at all times anyway).
