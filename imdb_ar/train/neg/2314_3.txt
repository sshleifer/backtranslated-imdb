Plot Synopsis: When his wife is kidnapped, the news reporter and her replacement by doubling the Android system, the Secret Service agent Eric Phillips is tracking down and discovering a plan by a weapons dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. /> <br /> I did not expect much when I first saw this sequel to the low budget Cyber ​​Tracker / Richard Pippin. This film was not something special, let alone the glaring split of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This relay is the same as before, with a comprehensive motion sequence that opens the movie. There are plenty of explosions, heavy shooting and a huge number of people, as well as some combat moves to the movie star "Don Wilson" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of motion scenes built-in with minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personal transplant.
