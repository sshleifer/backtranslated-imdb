Be careful: This film tells a lot of love stories without any coherence. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film's sole purpose is to show love in many different ways. A few minutes, so there is no evolution of characters and almost no plot. Just a superficial idea of ​​the plot. The author tried to build turning points aimed at surprise scenes. However, this did not work because you did not recognize the characters before or that these "jokes" were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie about love fails to reach your heart. Dozens of times. Or even more, do not know and do not care.
