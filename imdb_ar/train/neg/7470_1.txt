In Sao Paulo, Cristiano, Chico and Gabrielle joined the upper middle class and university students, going to a party with drugs and drinks. The next day, after their lessons, Cristiano's date comes the night before to his home, the three friends raped the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, surprised Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to dump the bodies and burn them in a dump, but throughout the night there are other tragedies. <br /> <br /> "Cama de Gato," the controversial and shameful crap about the alienation of young people, is certainly the worst Brazilian film I have seen in many years. The story is shallow, tragic and dark is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste. Scenario is not funny, with lines and dialogues stupid, boring, manipulative and ridiculous footage with interviews with the morbid teens at first and finally. The representation is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed with the promising existence of Cayo Platte in this trash. The camera, frames, film and version are amateur and of very low quality. Sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what actresses and actresses are talking about (it's probably a plus, as this click absorbs). Gang gangs are very realistic and are used to promote this medium film in marketing too bad to exploit sex. One voice (awful). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Bed of the Cat")
