Funky, funky movie. The director Borman Cahill is showing up the rich houses, but the male concern shows that he is unfaithful with the nanny, that's all at the time. The forensic scientist who investigates Cahill is blown up in his car, but he faces rats, and does not seem like a gentle man, so this is all right too. The Beits, the owner of Russborough House, have collected their money by exploiting the "Darkies" in diamond drilling, so it's okay to steal the priceless art of them and hide it in a vault in the Wicklow Mountains. Garda kills his rodents and gets involved in killing him. The moral equation is disturbing, Bormann is looking for a successful film, but he does not have the courage to stand up to the crime of the gang of generals, who terrorized the neighborhood, and launched another wave of vandalism on Dublin. He contacted the son of the generals while doing so. Disgusting. Shame on him for his cheese.
