From the novel by Richard Condon (Manchurian candidate 1962), this muddled story comes from conspiracies and political assassinations. The story, narrated in a comic book is almost hard to swallow. This bad effort was not a complete reason for the fault of the crew and the crew: the novel was full of the same short events. It seems as if at times the story is actually mocking the most sincere effort that has been put forward in the Manchurian Candidate. Disappointment in all respects.
