There is a scene near the start after the shoot where the horses are run. If there is something red that draws your attention, it is because a white car stands behind a bush near the corridor. I thought I had seen bad but that is it. A white car in the west. Did not they get this? Well, I paid a higher dollar when renting. It will make you want to grab your friends and make them all into 10 fantastic movies and make a better movie. The conversation was very slow, and acting was mostly OK but could not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of photography. There is a door in the mayors that looks like today's door with special pruning. I say watching this movie and moving the cabin boy to No. 2 in the worst case ever.
