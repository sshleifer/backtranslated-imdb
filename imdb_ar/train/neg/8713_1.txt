Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the representation, the effects but funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine with an army uniform who is ten very large sizes too bad with a standing attempt on the scowl on his face like the leader of his hilarious operations group! "Terrorists" are scary and realistic like "birds of prey," which is scary and very bad in everything that tries to laugh. It is the part that the giant T-REX infiltrates, which somehow slipped on a ship and then exploded in one way or another, and sees the metal pole holding its place where its head is the perfect end. In the case of your bad films, this is the gold bowl, the Mona Lisa for bb-bad !!!
