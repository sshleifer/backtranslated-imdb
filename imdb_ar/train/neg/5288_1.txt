Oh my God, was this "persuasion, running, running" of persuasion? It was terrible. It is bad that the "screenwriter" (and I use the term "very loose") cut the dialogue from one person to another and paste it, often out of context and rushing into the story: but Ann Elliot works from one location to another in search of Wentworth near the end of the piece was Terrible! Austin must rotate in her grave. No respectable young woman will behave in a terrible way. The actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austin remodeling tools are too bad, a new generation of monitors will be turned off. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a flawless copy of this wonderful novel (otherwise), get a 1995 edition of Roger Michel from Amanda Roth (who can speak the lyrics alone) and Searan Hinds. It is a nice.
