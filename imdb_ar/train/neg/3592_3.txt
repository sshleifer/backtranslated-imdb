For the fan series, I must admit that "hidden boundaries" are not so bad at all. However, the review of this series can not be based on whether it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity as well. I think these are people with normal jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, do all this work. Withdraw all these resources. Taking all this time, all these flaws are still. <br /> <br /> First of all, the lines are awful. For most. The dialogues belong to a military show in the 1970s, not Star Trek. The captain (Mr. Squinty) seems to be about to burst into laughter at any time. Most characters are just reading their lines. Managers must be aware of the fact that "restoration" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think that the series is made in the way "To Take Freaks", which produced many episodes and TNG films as well, I could not help but think that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going into this assumption. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about the whole project is the quality of the releases. When they first decided to spend a lot of time and resources on this series - why did not they make it available with good quality? Using a fast time format, with low low resolution is a waste of talent. Even "higres" rings are considered poor quality compared to the standard quality chain that is released. Using the Xvid codec, with greater resolution and file size, it was possible to greatly improve the experience. If the problem is with the band, setting up the BitTorrent Tracker would solve that. <br /> <br /> Let's hope the crew decide to clean the chain, and maybe release it on a DVD, giving it the quality of the project is worth.
