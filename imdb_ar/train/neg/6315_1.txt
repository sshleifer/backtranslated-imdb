This elegant and sexy movie is a must. Only when multiple scenes, one can really understand the uniqueness of this film. I personally enjoy the narrator for his intelligence, and there is no subject left to him, narrative style. Grab the foreground immediately, and carry you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. It offers a great look at the world of executable materials and allows the public to "communicate" with the inner horror that this film presents. The same scenario holds the film together wonderfully. Not only for children, but older people alike will gain a greater understanding of the materials they are familiar with and the modern understanding they have in the sexual experience. By its time and the leading film industry, it certainly knows the word "masterpiece".
