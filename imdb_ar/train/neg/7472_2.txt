This offer seems pretty good. Kira Sedjwick is a good actress and I love the police series, but somewhere in this production, there was a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> First of all, the book should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! This makes them boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and has no certifications. I know they want to be tough, but Chase means stupid and bad leader. Crimes are monotonous and nice, and only lame along the way. As mentioned above, I hate it .... <br /> <br /> In general, this was a very big and very bad disappointment already ...
