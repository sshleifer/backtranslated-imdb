Even if 99.99% of the people who watched this film are Brazilian, I will follow English as it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of art. The worst representation I've ever seen. The children are terrible. Specially the boy. This was the first time I saw a person with a less expressive expression on Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the tone of one voice, like a 5-year-old reading in front of a classroom. How can a very bad person be the main actor of the film? The story is so shallow that my daughter could have been better (3 years old). It was very simple and could be written in a handkerchief and was told in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone enjoying this movie: 1) You are pre-teen; 2) Your brain has been brainwashed by Globo's stupidity so that you think that anything contains a gorgeous Globo seal; Serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs! Shame on the Brazilian film scene.
