Two years before Arthur's writing and directing, Steve Gordon achieved a minor success in the scenario of Henry Winkler's famous comedy car, then The Fonz. A university student in the 1950s (and all around) mingled and married without any job opportunities on the horizon; to meet his needs, he turned to the world of wrestling, eventually becoming a "wonderful George" like celebrities. Winnkler's distasteful conversion may seem to be an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from the style of television), but jokes and attitudes are often wrong and broad, and activist director Karl Rainer. Crude oil in particular is an outrageous piece that includes Herve Fleches (from "Fantasy Island") placing moves on Polly Holliday (Flue of "Alice"). As darling Henry, Kim Darby seems far from her element - especially when surrounded by all these televisions - making the romantic side of the script irrational. * 1/2 of ****
