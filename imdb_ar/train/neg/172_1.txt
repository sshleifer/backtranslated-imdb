Return to Cabin by the Lake does not stand in any way on the original. With the return of only one main character (Stanley) for sequencing, the movie is not worth up to two hours of your time. I'm very impressed with the first film, the story line and the acting were really good, but this is a film I will never see again. It's basically the same as the Urban Legends and Blair Witch sequences, but with much worse behavior. I've seen personally acting better in the soap opera, it's very unfortunate that you just have to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, but watching it will diminish the first.
