I rented a block of films from Blockbuster last night and this was the first movie I saw (it was late Saturday night and wanted to "fix the horror film") ... <br /> <br /> Wow, this was awful, almost embarrassing .. A story of the kind who really thought films like Scream had put an end to it; amateur actors who offer a whole, modern and unbelievable dialogue have already been written and read from the page; and the unsuspecting scenes (especially when a weak film takes place). <br /> <br /> But I always thought that no movie deserved 100%. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: I love this actress. She is the only member of the team that offers any talent at all. The only reason I took the chance of renting this is that its name was on the front cover. They gain their presence in this wreck professionally, although they are sometimes concerned that they act in such a sinister story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Hilarious Unintentional: This is the kind of film I can remember watching again when there were still mill theaters all over the country, used to include the nonsense of such a third film on a tripartite bill with some Thriller and prestige films that finally made their way to remote areas. Unfortunately, in this immediate age of video, most viewers have to take these turkeys alone now without a community experience as part of an audience that cheers and throws things on the screen because the film is so terrible. <br /> <br /> # 3 Stars of the porn stars try to act: most of them are within reach because producers do not need to accompany or seek with them to abandon extended sexual scenes, but this barter usually means that they actually speak Some fonts are supposed to present a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And proudly, they all offer experience in looking at folly when trying to act. I'll rule Ginger Lynn Allen almost of this group if her character is not supposed to be Irish and she is actually trying to sometimes do a dialect, which keeps the smiles coming. <br /> <br /> It's good to look for pros in all experiments, and that's what I took from this tub known as "Evil Breed"
