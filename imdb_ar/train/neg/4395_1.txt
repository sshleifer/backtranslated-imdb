December specials, such as Frosty's original, must be rich in high-quality music and a healthy and opaque story. They must have a touch of mystical magic of the holidays. Essentially, sound, sound, feeling ... must sound "special" and must have suitable sub-text for December. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the Frosty The Snowman legend on TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped up by telling them the story of Frosty's original and passionately related how much I enjoyed him as a child. When my wife and children bounced on the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my kids were yawning, and my wife and I were giving each other a "look" and a roll of our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed - I think they were tired of the nonsensical language and the nonsensical slices. I have already felt embarrassed by their disappointment (and I) towards this film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Legend of Frosty the Snowman is like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents crossed with a worse-than-usual episode of SpongeBob in a classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... These shows are good and I love them just like the next guy, but when I see Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for medium, non-colored, sub-text, and mind) are always satisfied with anesthesia rings. <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better option than a bad legend of bad snowman snow.
