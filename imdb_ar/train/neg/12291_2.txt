Important, an Italian film starring David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest, and in fact, I took less than I expected. This does not mean that this movie is the worst I've ever seen because I've seen things worse than this but the plot was often confusing and not interesting and some good scenes are the only thing that saves this. Apart from that you will love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I just want to watch "Troll 3" by this same director, certainly it would not be worse.
