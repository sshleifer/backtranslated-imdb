If you're renting a movie titled "Generic Pest 3000", you'll be good at knowing what you'll get. I have sold myself through the promising descriptions of "nuclear mutants" and "psychic dead", and of course the "self-righteous" who, according to the state of the film shop, all hover around the barrenness of the post-apocalyptic. The wasteland wreaks havoc. Allow the idiot hackers and low budget ideas - at least, my hopes were in this "film". <br /> <br /> Now I like the awesome Terrible movie, and if you read comments on pesticides from the year 3000, you probably do too. However, I rated this movie as "1 (Too Bad)" - not because I hated the film completely but because it was one of the most horrifying efforts to make films I've ever seen. Dialogue, representation, cinematography, voice editing, editing in general, plot, etc., etc. - all deserve what must certainly be expectations of low-profile spectators given this wonderful title. <br /> <br /> So what is really "good" in this bad movie? She has many that my circle affectionately calls "quality kills". Good killing, for those few of you who are not familiar with this phrase, is not a difficult term, but in general refers to someone who has been killed in a heinous, creative or ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> The adjectives of the 3000's also have a large number of "dialogue - very bad - it becomes funny", provided in large part by Crazy Bull, the leader with the apt title of the gang of unfortunate motor-kinetic cars - Who by the way also offer most of the qualities that kill (if you hope to get big things from nuclear mutants, think again, they play a key role in the movie ... shucks!). Crazy Bull, however, is all you can ask for in the b-movie motor-psycho. Shakespeare rephrasing and insulting PG style odd is all he knows how to say ... and that's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite its quality kills and bad dialogue, however, if you're looking for a really amusingly bad movie, "The 3000 Mabido" disappoints somewhat because of its pull that is limited to things like silly special effects that are pardoned Time, good killing and bad dialogue, there is not enough to justify the length of the full feature, mainly for forty minutes or so, forcing the public to follow the characters in the "chases" long boring cars and desert hiking series ... In general, It's a very good movie, but hey, it's not the 2000 death race.
