The Colombo film scenario seems to have been pulled straight from a cynical soap opera in the 1980s. Character-based movies are very impressive, but only if characters are compelling. In this film, the only convincing thing was my desire to change the channel. The Punk dialog box looks as though it was written by a romantic novelist. Lt. Colmbo himself is not a place near his famous, likable, self-mutilated character; the bride's victim / abductor is a one-dimensional sedition girl (suffering from the fear of a small scalpel stuck by his hand on the face of her abduction - come on! ). In any sense of reality, this character had to at least try to fight or fight at least a little. And talk about reality .... The story revolves around a kidnapping that the police solved. the police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI is handling every kidnapping case. This was not Colombo, just a shallow and predictable crime drama with our well known Colombo lieutenant and stretching to two hours.
