What a waste of time and money! I and Perby saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking about it "may be funny". Error! The length of this film is about 90 minutes. The actors are trapped in a badly written text and can not get out. The jokes are weak and tiring, and even Wilson's bare vision can not recover any part of the film. Special effects ..... are not. I was expecting to see half the harness and wires that Uma was carrying in flight. When the effects do not seem to be able to master the scenes of super-flying or fast-fighting scenes, they cover everything with a whirlpool of the blurry screen-which hides spectacularly horrific effects. Wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with Uma or his colleague in his office. Sex scenes were not sexy and were not funny scenes. I think I expected many of these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I ended up not caring in any way. The only memorable performances were children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall, super stinko movie - I do not recommend it even as a rent - it will still be a waste of money!
