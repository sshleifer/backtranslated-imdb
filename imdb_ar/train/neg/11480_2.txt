I saw this with my girlfriend after I stumbled upon her while she was pressing the channels. <br /> <br /> I think both of us were hoping to have some kind of happy movies for a happy family, but we were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> It seems that the actor who plays the soldier does not have any emotions at all, his face looks the same, whether he cuts the Christmas tree, or sees the girl he loves kiss her by her boyfriend, or when surprised by the girl he loves , A representative, and none of us did anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the nice blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count points and cheat on her friend, what a problem! Her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count on more points. <br /> <br /> So it's basically a story about a man without any feelings or feelings on the part of a man who calculates points and deceives her boyfriend, it is as predictable as it really is, a waste of time really, you gain nothing By watching this, unlike some strange laughter, it is all very strange. <br /> <br /> I love it when her father says that he only eats french fries and not French wine, and they all laugh. That's the lean attitude around this film. Moreover, if my friends are taking care of me, I would say Something to him or tell him, but not our veteran army, no sir, he let everyone boss around him. <br /> <br /> The film is what the "first blood" was, if John Rambo was burned like the most violent in the world.
