The romantic sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of strength and privilege. Oh. Does this excite your appetite? Well, then, connect to VHS or DVD and wonderful on this unwarranted phishing across a slice of hot history. Well, the book was composed by the famous penetrator Anne Rice. The output is cloying and melodramatic like cheesy dialogue. Most acting is amateur. The only noteworthy product was that it employed more than a dozen black actors, all of whom rarely worked in the market today (Jasmine Jay, Ben Feren, Bam Greer, and Earth Kate), including some faces barely seen at all Lawson, Rachel Cotrell). It is also, however, a wonderful display of Nicole Lin. James Earl Jones's strange and surprising is at hand as well. So the late Osie Davis is a very small talent for his success in his association with the legendary Negro Ensemble. This movie should be rated "T" for the ball.
