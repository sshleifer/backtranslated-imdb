With an address like this, goes beyond my understanding of how this film did not appeal to me. There are some nice moments and a bit of calm, but the way the film was filmed and the general outline of the story shocked me just as a stupid and lazy attempt at the "heavy" shock tactics ... The inconsistent plot begins with a man raping and killing a woman stranded on the side the path. He and his brother are incarcerated until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend in the forest. He ends up being forced to go into the house, where they stand up and later show a group of men kidnapped in the basement. The heavily drugged prisoners are made up of her old boyfriend who raped her, one of her "kidnapped" neighbors, and her sexually assaulted boss. Explains to her that he will kill them all. She ended up killing HIM, then shifting her focus toward the men (or pigs) who torment and kill them ... Most of the violence and humiliation is related to eating and destroying the genitals - all of which is far from disturbing and basically moderate. The best scene is masturbation with a graphic handle followed by some painful rape ... Certainly "I Spit on Your Corpse, IP! Ss on Your Grave" was an informal supplement to "I Spit on Your Grave" - ​​based on the title, The main character - suggests that her mother was Camille Keaton. Personally, I consider that a blasphemous affirmation! This movie is a boring mess, amateurs struggling for shocks but failed miserably ...
