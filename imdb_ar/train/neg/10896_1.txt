I know you've read it before, on countless other movies, be sure if you read comments here, but the Voodoo Academy still represents the worst film I've ever been able to track. Undoubtedly, the bad things are not really available to buy or watch on television, but even so I feel it's fair to be qualified because I'm not just a stupid tenant I chose very much. <br /> <br /> I've watched two-thirds of the top 100 films rated here on imdb, and watch the remaining movies every chance. Most of them stand on top of the head and shoulders above this ... excel in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to make really bad films (as in movies without humor even in how bad they are) depending on the number of people you need to watch with to make it all the way. If you can see it yourself, this is not so bad. If you can see it with one friend ... this is bad, but it may be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> It took us 5 of us to make it all the way through the Voodoo Academy. Not even the usual fun moments to watch bad movies (locating a booming microphone for example, 3 times in this movie if I'm not mistaken) can take away the dry taste in my mouth. Yes I saw it, but I also forced 4 of my friends to see it with me to this end. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray to God to see the filmmakers cut off ... to believe that there can be a version with another 20 minutes of big brow eyebrows with the baby oil glands rubbing their trunk just scares from hell to me. Many films revolve around this topic. <br /> <br /> I commend David Deco for filming this film in two days with a short budget, just as I commend him for convincing people to take him out of the celluloid version of some of his daughters. But it is not a good film. The original horror shop was shot at the same time period for a cash amount compared (due to inflation) and was an absolute gem. It is no excuse for how bad this child is. <br /> <br /> The future spoilers ... <br /> <br /> It's not even worth picking up the holes in the plot or knowing the clich√©s all hero characters .. the speed of the movie ... crazy ... nothing .. Interesting for the length of time allocated by decoteau self - massage chest. No matter the alignment or sex of your ... just rub can not maintain this kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> The acting is cheesecake ... but not overly amateur ... I've seen a lot in the worst movies best ... but somehow is the semi-qualified delivery of some of the worst lines you ever hear in a movie What, this is really a grate. <br /> <br /> Rent this if you have, like me, magic with the worst of it, and only if you will see it with a group of people willing to work to pass it. This is not ha ha ha ha wobble group case. It's a tolerance test you might want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there is something worse ... but I would not be surprised if he had a decoteau name on it.
