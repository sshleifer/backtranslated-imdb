It's a sad film about this woman who thought her ex-husband, whom I loved so much, might have been dead, but in fact his father was a scientist who had put a mantra on him to turn him into that really gentle shark. Kind of like in beauty and beast. It is possible to use a scene for a dance hall and maybe some singing candles, but there are some very beautiful plants instead. They make this girl really itchy, so she leaves herself eaten by the shark instead of scratching the entire film. The scientific man is a good father trying to reunite his son the fish shark with the woman he worked with. He even arranges for them to spend special time for sex, but the woman in this bat is really shallow and thinks about the shark. The man is an ugly monster, and does not want to do anything with him. I gave up love! Just because it was a shark! I thought it was very sad that all he had to do was kiss him, he would return to normal and live happily ever after, but not in this kind of movies.
