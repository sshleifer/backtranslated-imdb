An interesting film about a real event occurred during the Vermont Civil War. He kept my attention until the end and I do not regret watching him. I had not read anything about this raid, so I was curious to see if the rebels had done it. I enjoy historical films from that era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint concerns Confederate uniforms. Looks very good !!! The acting was a bit harsh at times. I loved the old man who ate mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier who was playing with a dog was a little strange. Overall, it was a movie descent.
