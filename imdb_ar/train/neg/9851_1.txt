What's worse than the worst of Dave Lynch is "Confusathon", "Brain Dead" makes no sense at all. The shamefully wasted talents (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) bounce back as if they were in a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon on acid. There is little personal development. It simply begins to climb the "odd range", until it climbs into total chaos. Do not suck in this because of the fine actors above. They are not given anything to work and will wonder what happens throughout the entire 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding "dead death" at all costs, unless you scatter your mind in total nonsense. - Merck
