Disappointing and angry. The scriptwriter does not have a true understanding of human nature, but instead combines cliches in a disjointed way. The personal is not explored in depth. These dolls are planted in a plot that explicitly admits that they need a dramatic element, a mother's relationship with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reed performs exceptionally well despite having some unique positions and lines, such as standing in a negative position to let her angry daughter throw her in the eye. The text portrays Daren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekel / Mr. Hyde without any hints about the reason, but he drinks cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> The mature writer could have done a lot on this subject.
