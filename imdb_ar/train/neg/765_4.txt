Seriously, what were they thinking? Over the years, the Colombo series has experimented with some new things and moved away from the usual successful version, but this film really went beyond it. This film is essentially different from any other Colombo film, but the differences are not in favor of the film. <br /> <br /> The main thing that makes this film different from any other Colombo film is the fact that there is no murder committed. The full premise of this film is quite different and puts Colombo's character in a completely different environment and put it. The overall is also quite different and more up-to-date. <br /> <br /> Alan J. Levi has made some other Colombo movies in the past, all of which have been adhered to in the usual format. He also makes a curious choice to guide this film. <br /> <br /> The character of Colombo himself seems quite different, perhaps because of why he is placed in a completely different environment and situation, when his nephew helps after his bride disappears immediately after the wedding. The lack of some good humor and Colombo brand also does not make this watch good or quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the film does not start very badly but the film begins to become more and more ironic with its story as it progresses. It is the story of a stupid, written kidnapping film with a story that is becoming more and more unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more unreachable. This is a very small and interesting introduction to Colombo, as it does not really know the entertainment of viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> It also does not help much that supporting actors are not the most talented about. Despite the fact that his character was placed in such a completely different situation and that the film was filmed in a completely different way, Peter Falk is still standing and his presence still saves the film to some extent. Can you just film how this movie was without him? It was a very bad and ironic film I can tell you. <br /> <br /> The introduction of a strange Colombo, which can be described as a failed attempt to convert from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 10/4
