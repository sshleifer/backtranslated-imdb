Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest shell provided by this kind of horror. Like any other horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think that in order to put your name in the foreground on a movie title, you must have at least one movie. I can not really think of any other film by Huber (alone, do not count on the Poltergeist) that really influenced the horror genre or film world. This film, Night Terrors, supports my point only. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, give him credit for doing at least a good job with the terrible stuff he got. He did what he could. As for the film itself? Pure hard work. Naked bare scenes every five minutes, a story that must be chained in our music and film scene. Nothing in this film can be replaced. do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> In general, I feel sorry for Huber, it seems his career is over before it actually begins. I hope he can pump at least one good click, and in this way his religious status can bring some justice. <br /> <br />
