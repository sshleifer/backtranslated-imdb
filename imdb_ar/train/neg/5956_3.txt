Another horror flick in the battles of the teenager with a crazy man and the owner of the supernatural who wants to take over ?! Yes, but the fact that this one from Canada gives her a slightly different feeling. "The Brain" has an annoying teenager Jim Majelewski undergoing treatment whose leader turns into a cult leader assisted by an ugly "mind". Can C block it? I think that since our northern neighbor has done all they can, they have the right to make a horror movie at least. However, they may want to be known to have access to national health care and all of them. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why did not the people who made this film do it?
