Flame in, Flame out. It seems that Gammera in short, a creature of prehistoric times can take it and leave it with the same degree of abandonment. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I'm committed to watching all the clicks on the 50-film science fiction set by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It's a great value in about 25 baccalaureas, so in 50 cents per film, it's really about investing in time to see some nasty shows. <br /> <br /> Gamira is engulfed in a long hibernation. Of a nuclear explosion, he is not happy. Such as Godzilla, took her to Tokyo and put the United Nations in motion to try to come up with a plan to save the planet. They reach "Plan Z", hope the world, and you will not know it, there is a scene where a huge shed is called the Z Plan building; this was a nice touch. <br /> <br /> By the mid-1960s, this country was still politically incorrect. One of the US military scenes in the air defense sector in Alaska asked General Arnold of the sergeant to make coffee. I think there were no soldiers around him. <br /> <br /> The old Gamira was not very close to sight, walking on two feet and heading towards the throw of the flame when challenged. For this reason, it surprised me how Plan Z captured the turtle man in the nose of a hidden space ship, which led him to Mars to save the world. Great times everywhere for the American and Russian team saved, let's now go back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera has produced at least dozens of movies, but after watching this beautiful film greatly satisfies my interest in flying, the flaming turtles. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier has an "Attack of the Monsters" with a distinguished guest by Big G. It took all I had to do until the end of both films; it was convenient to reach the final frame in this frame that said "Gammera , Sayonara! "
