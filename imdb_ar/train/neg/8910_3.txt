This film has a very simple but very bad plot in one way or another. The whole movie revolves around a girl sucked through a gate for another dimension and then years later being opened back by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor having a problem overcoming his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers with her new partner ... Another girl ... it's true that they are lesbians and there is some nudity of course without a particular reason). Unfortunately the demon now follows the adult girl through the return. Unfortunately also, none of this has been clarified. Where were they exactly? Where did Satan come from? How did you survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who trained her on hell and made her out of the wrestler outfit? The representation is terrible, but it is difficult to determine because the writing is very bad maybe there was nothing they could do. I give it three because the gladiator was good and the effects were very enjoyable although they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not too bad enough to be funny.
