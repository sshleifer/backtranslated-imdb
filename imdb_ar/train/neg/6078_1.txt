I rarely comment on films but I read the other comments and I can not believe there are people applauding this celluloid garbage. I know there are some people who have an agenda of their own, but let's take it on merit; behave badly, badly filmed, and feel the story when the director makes it as he walks. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film, which includes young children because the filmmakers knew clearly what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is that it's a terrible film, the content is bad and humiliating, the production is amateurs and I am happy because they could not produce such a movie legally today
