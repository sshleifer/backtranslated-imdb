What can you say about this film, but it is very easy. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reason to see this, but that's it, but their talent is lost in this scrap. I think they used some of Adam's scenes, like when he runs because you can not see his face. If Adam is embarrassed to be in a nightmare nightmare, just think of what he should have felt about appearing in this ??? Whether it's before or after, I'm not sure, but nevertheless, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (see Mystery Science Theater 3000 first and last) compared to this. Of the representatives. From the Wild One of Marlon Brando, of course. Tina looks amazing though. I hope to get them and Adam on a good salary !! Human!
