Kenan Evori and Waynes are probably one of the worst directors, and I swear he has no real knowledge of how to make films. He made a wonderful film and this is a scary film. The scary movie 2 was very good but everything else Keenan made was real karate. Avoid such titles as not being a threat to the South Central while drinking juice in the cover ..... I know, what a title !!! Obviously this film too, anything has the name Kenan in credits. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. Just trust me in this, maybe the women may love this movie a bit because of some things that happen but in general this movie will never love anyone who has good taste in movies ........ 1/10 ..... jit setton
