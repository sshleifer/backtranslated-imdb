A few weeks ago, I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. I fascinated her and thought she was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented a DVD, I was fascinated to see how this adjustment was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not come close to creating the atmosphere or developing the characters Orwell did brilliantly in his book. The director seems to believe that everyone watching the film has read the book, because it does not try to explain why the characters behave and feel the way they work. John Hurt, the main actor, wanders all the way and hardly does anything until the end. We do not really know what he does for a living, or why his love relationship is blocked, what the political climate is and why the main character wants to rebel. This book can not be achieved in the form of a film without proper narrative and interpretation of the political system that persecutes the characters, and the fact that these missing are the biggest drawback in this film. John Hurt was also a great choice for the show, where he was about 15 years old about Winston, 39, who was supposed to picture him. On the most positive side, however, the rest of the cast was chosen well. It's so bad they put in such a terribly air-conditioned movie with the wrong main actor. Brian Sen
