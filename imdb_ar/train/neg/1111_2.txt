The final song for Johnny Rivers was the only great thing in this film. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about this western film. I must write another 8 lines until my comments are published, but there are more than 8 horrific lines in this West. I'm not sure if the movie is in honor of the Hopa Along or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this film were very plastic. Not realistic at all. Many of the supporting actors in this film seemed original, but the shooting scenes were a joke. I thought a former commentator that this film was wonderful, and in the comments took a cheap shot of President Bush. This was not a democratic or a Western republic. It was just a bad Western movie being sold commercially. I wonder if she has paid any money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie done by college students. If so, it was a great film.
