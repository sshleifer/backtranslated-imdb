Do you know this feeling of joy when you see a film trying hard to be a serious and thought-provoking piece of film and fail miserably? When you can not, can you bust out laughing at the horrible nature of the trash scattered on your screen? "House of the Dead" is struggling to achieve this low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, House of the Dead has re-created the feeling that you just woke up to discover that the cat has placed a carefully curled toy on your forehead while you're asleep. It is clear from the start that female female actresses have been selected because of the size of the division (which they shamelessly exploit) while the male position is "hardcore." Frankly, I did not care about any of the characters at any moment in the film and I found myself hoping for their actual death to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have thought of showing two-hour footage of the actual game as a film. At least then we will move better? However, actors can not be blamed because it is certain that the production of a convincing film when confronted with the scenario of this film is a challenge. It can be said that it is the worst part of the film and actually contains lines like "These are the zombies, pure and simple" and "No hat, we should not go there! <br /> <br /> We all know that zombie movies will never be thought-provoking or full of meanings; at best, they are harmful for two hours of work, blood and terror wardrobe. Garbage, yes, but the trash is amusing. This is not the kind of garbage that bursts out of your trunk bag as you pull it all over the room and polish your shoes in cans of yogurt and decomposing banana. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received very poor ratings for which no Danish cinemas were bought. If we can only get the same privilege. <br /> <br /> The end result: 1/10.
