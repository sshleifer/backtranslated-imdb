The film format is an exciting shock shape. There are surprises, shifts and turns, reflections and excitement. Sometimes, this film is really "seat edge". But they are disappointing, and very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is unreasonable; his character does not hold up. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but I will only say that the character we meet at the beginning can not be what we see in the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment in the film is that - finally, it has become a largely illusory film. There is a slight qualitative difference between this and a Friday 13 film. Not that every film needs to be always completely savory, but this film does not tire drip at times. <br /> <br /> Although the film features a wonderful Sean Connery, it does not reach its normal level, and often seems to walk through the pace.
