This click reminded me of those lame "erotic excitement" that I used to stay awake watching Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I used to classify this fine graces because there was no bump and two simmers. However, there are tons of nudity - the opening scene in the club of the sectors, we see keester Kane keester (or at least a stunt) and then a 10-minute gay dance scene in the middle of the film and a naked female vampire scene that seems to have been stolen from Monster's costume. The 13-year-old boys rejoice. <br /> <br /> Other than that, the scenes of the doomed transformations have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The footage looks like FMV from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. Wolf is so bad that it can not be explained, and despite the poor quality of the suit that appears in the way, many times. <br /> <br /> Plot and representation are meaningless. There is some eccentric back story about wolves and wolves with wolf wolf - Dark Wolf is the last, but what I can say is that hybrids do the same, all wolves look like human form and turn into a wolf that kills people. Darkwolf tries to find a mate but is unlikely to find a mate but can inhale anyone she touches. Once again, these skills prove useless. Darkwolf ends up killing many people who have not met their goal, met or even seen the best I can say. The associates do not know that they are a werewolf and are resisting transformation or anything. <br /> <br /> You thought it would be hard to ruin a simple monster movie that was so bad, but they did it well. Want low-end quality of the wolf, go, rent the soldiers the dogs want tons of T & A This is your flick.
