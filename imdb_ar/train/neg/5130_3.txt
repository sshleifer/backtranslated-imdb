Jeanine Garofalo was very general in her dissatisfaction with this film, calling him, among other things, anti-feminist. She also said on her radio program that she hated making a "romantic comedy" because she did not believe in it. I honestly agree with Janine here. This film is trivial at best. They do their best, but in general, it was just a boring, incredible, "romantic comedy", unfounded in the real world. While there will be some who say "hang your disbelief", one is tired of having to hang it every time you get a romantic Hollywood movie. For some reason, Janine's portrait is portrayed in shadows and darkness, making her look unattractive, while Auma's character is portrayed in lighter colors (possibly angered by Janine and may be one of the reasons why she dislikes this film). This really hurts the film if we want to buy the premise that Janine is supposed to be better than the two. As many have said here and on other topics related to comments, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact very beautiful. I did not read a single review where someone said that Uma was looking better. Having said that, I think the character of Ben Chaplin will probably stay with Uma, not with Janine. Many men do not like really smart women (and a lot of women do not like really smart guys) and unfortunately, Ben probably stayed with Uma. Although the director tried to make Janine unattractive, it did not work. Its natural beauty comes across anyway. <br /> <br /> I think many of Janine's male fans are so obsessed with this film because they like to think of themselves in the character of Ben Chaplin, and actually they score with Janine. Janeane is much more complex than the character she plays here (real life is always more complicated than Hollywood imagines), so take the gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is famous for, and that's a shame, because this is not really good for a film.
