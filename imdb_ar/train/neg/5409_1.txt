The mystery of Christmas was described as a wonderful movie, but I was genuinely disappointed. They sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over, which led me to believe that the producers were really proud of this project. As a representative on the screen, I felt most of the shows were over the phone, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this film in my beautiful resume. It was embarrassing. I've been a fan since Walton's days, but I found myself in no hurry to watch any of his later works, this was a poor show. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, the directions were simplified, mechanical, and completely amateurish. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not a sharp review and negative assumptions about my credentials as a critic. I played the movie because he had a good team and I was ready to enjoy the film. However, I challenge anyone there to watch this movie and not want to reclaim their money, even though it was on T.V.
