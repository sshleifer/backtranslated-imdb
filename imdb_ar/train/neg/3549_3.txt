Do you like standing? And then move away from this ... <br /> <br /> During the early rounds, there are actually good cartoons, but unless they get some nice qualities, they have a chance for snowballs. No controversial articles and you are out! ... I think I was hurt as much as I did to the neglected comedians, when I see who the twisted judges are allowing them to enter. <br /> <br /> 1 of the best 4 characters has made me beyond qualifying. Half of the finalists gave me 0 laughs. Many of them have moved their materials elsewhere, something the judges do not seem to be having trouble with. <br /> <br /> It's much more fun than what's on TV, but it's hard to see without thinking. What could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers change the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism will lose its validity. Maybe an idea?
