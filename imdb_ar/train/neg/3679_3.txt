It is a Japanese film but there is little English spoken here too. It is a beautiful film, with beautiful pictures, showing the beautiful beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, that was the only perfect quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman swallowing 90 percent of the film because her husband "photographer" is much larger than what he announced? Granted, this can be a problem ...... but overtake it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last ten minutes does she do a violent job and become fond of him. By then, for most viewers, it was too late. We were asleep at the time.
