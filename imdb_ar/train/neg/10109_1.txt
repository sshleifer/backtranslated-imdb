The man continues to extinguish the absolute garbage and the cynical thing is that he loves his nonsense. <br /> <br /> I have never seen an Ole Lummel movie but I was very surprised at how everyone thinks its purposes are appalling. Like the movies I said at first, not worth six when they were added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really was. It's the worst there. <br /> <br /> Credits will not end with the start of the pathetic movie and soon I noticed that the sound was filmed very badly. It was a very horrible representation as it was happening in camera shots. Editing is the worst easily. This film had no meaning and I could not carry it anymore because it would not end, and I was only 45 minutes in the film. I could not take it anymore. I have lost 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> Do not see this squeak!
