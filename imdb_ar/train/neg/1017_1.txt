My God. This was terrible. There is a bad, then there was this. This film is meaningless at all. It runs all over the map and is not clear what it says at all. The music seemed to be trying to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, take away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and getting to know all these places made it unlikely. Why did not they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was Tillman, where John Hurd did a great job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not above the top and the camp. It was really shameful to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and that the film would be a scraping. so sad. Hopefully someone sees it as important, and at least grant John Heard credit when credit is due, and hire him as a bad man again, which he should have. On the menu
