Slashers ..... Well if you like the horrors that you will surely see, otherwise do not bother. It is quite clear that this film has a very low budget, for example it seems as if the entire movie has been filmed in a warehouse somewhere, and on many occasions you'll see Mike Bum Shadow and Shadow Manz Shadow, trust me you will not need to search for it. Also try to ignore the cowardly actors, if that's what you call !! Is a few people who decide to go in a game show where they have to stay a night in a big maze because they are 3 killers on rotten and who lives in the end becomes rich. Now there's something about this movie that makes you watch it and seldom find it with cheap budget horror these days, for example when I saw it I thought to myself that I would not mind going in this game! Especially for $ 12,000,000. So anyway, I advise you to watch it and make up your mind.
