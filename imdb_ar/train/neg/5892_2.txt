(Gourd, 2000), but Gore was horribly done (a green body with red eyes !?) A weak story, a weak subject (I find it very difficult to find a scary picture message). There were moments in this film that made me tremble, both of which included an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another one of Miike Takashi, this 1999) made me shiver for hours after seeing him, and all the films he steals were actually scary, I can not see this The movie as anything other than a popular sale of big Japanese horror movies. Two out of every ten.
