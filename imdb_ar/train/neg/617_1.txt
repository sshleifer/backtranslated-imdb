First, let me start by quoting one of my friends who said while watching this film: "This whole movie was a dare, you know, like," DUDE, I bet you can not make the worst movie ever. " With this film, they made a good effort to achieve this title. The effects, of course, are bad. The plot / dialogue is similar to a collection of bits stolen from each horror film of type B. Actors, I suppose, are supposed to be in college. After parts of it (especially at first) make it seem as if they were supposed to be in high school or middle school. This makes no sense. Scarecrow about killing people is not the least fun. (The spoiler: In the end, when they shout in the name of Leicester and return his appearance, both the black man and the scarecrow laugh, and they may have been relieved in their final scene, and in the cowardly dialogue.)
