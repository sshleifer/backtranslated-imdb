While the hypothesis behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be interesting, the execution is patently pathetic. I'm not sure where to start, as I'm having a lot of problems with this film. I assume I will do a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Representation ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your film, do you know you're in trouble? I do not care very much, but these are hardly list names. Susan George may have been in two films I enjoy, but I did not consider her the greatest actress I've ever seen. In this film, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, say what he says the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? The ghosts, spirits, or what you want to call me reminded me of many ghosts in a haunted mansion. Disney World. They are scary. Why should they be so obvious? Dexterity is not a feature of "the house where evil dwells." <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How can one film prediction be? The result of this film is painfully clear by interviewing the three main characters. If you can not see where this movie was directed after about 15 minutes, you'll need to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The comfortable priest? What are the chances that the haunted house you are just buying across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that someone knows the history of your home and comes and knocks on the door and asks if you need help to remove evil spirits. The absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very hard for me to think of any positives to write about. I assume that I will give him a point for the opening scene and a point for the engineering of the house. Is this a sure sign of the winner? The reference to architecture as one of the highlights of any film does not mean much about the actual film. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You should be able to get the idea from what you already mentioned. I did not even mention the naughty little girl or the cancer invasion or many other problems. Be careful, this is terrible.
