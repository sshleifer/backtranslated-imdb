I found this documentary very strange and useless. I know she got prizes and things, but I personally did not enjoy them very much. There was no teaser or drama to keep you interested, just a bunch of werdos and their functions. Some people are rather different and it is not bad, it did not leave a good impression on me. I was very bored by this film, and it was not contrary to my school of creative writing. The theme of the circus throughout the entire film was fantastic, but I did not get it, and the robots and taming of the lion is nothing. The green animals thing was neat, I loved a lot of colored flowers in the garden, but how did these four posts be linked? It did not make sense to me why someone made a film about it. But if you are in such things, you may enjoy them. Who am I to stand in your way. I just warn you about the potential suffering.
