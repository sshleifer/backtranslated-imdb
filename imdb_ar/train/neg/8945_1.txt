I have to admit, there are a few books with corresponding films that I have already read before seeing film adaptation. Fourteen and eighty happens to be one of those rare cases. The book was wonderful. It was an immersive and interesting prophetic. But the film just sucked plain. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason for not stopping operational after the first five minutes is the fact that watching the movie was half the task of two seasons. It was dark and strange, but it did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. The representation was not above average, and given the fact that there was not much to do with it, it was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston was unable to blow more than one syllable at a time. The film is boring, annoying and invisible, and the film has been completely canceled. Wait a second ... is not it Britain?
