No, not the GWB, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". He must have realized the age of this dog because the series of two episodes was burned at one time, most of them being broadcast between 11 pm. Friday nights and Saturday morning. Why did I see the whole thing? I can only beg for the sudden jerky weekly attacks of Masonry. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are unknown and are likely to remain anonymous. The only names that can be identified are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn out to be the only decent shows (Jones does not go through the entire series - lucky woman). Ward, by the way, good aging days ago "bird fork". <br /> <br /> The only main thread of the plot - the father of the heroine who was wrongly convicted of killing his father but was released six years later in the swordsman - runs for a long time and ends so quickly that you will not particularly care who did it. There is a great deal of "steamy" sex, many murders, and all kinds of rude behavior - almost nothing interesting or reliable. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and certainly not talented. Writing and directing on an equal footing with cast. <br /> <br /> If you stick to the end, your postcard will be "too small." <br /> <br /> Consider your own warning!
