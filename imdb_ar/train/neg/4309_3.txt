A high school principal (Kenan Win) with a losing basketball team who unintentionally hired a coach not only as a brilliant blond woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but also as a catalyst for the new winning methods. Are you really surprised? Along the way romance grows between coach and team star Jack (Michael Bien). Police are never notified. <br /> <br /> They are combined with other Crown International images like a mill film that does not offer any service. This can be easily edited in a TV movie of the week. Kathy Lee Crosby looks great as Randy Rawlings in her tight clothes, but I expected more than a crush on a R film. The reason for the success of the new team rather than coaching Kathy Lee is that there is a side-by-side plot that is reckless and hypnotized by teammates As a former Sydney Wicks basketball player. Too much spoofing and corruption is not enough that makes this a great disappointment.
