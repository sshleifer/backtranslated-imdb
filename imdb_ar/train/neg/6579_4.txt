The "best new friend" is another entry in the subtype "steal another woman's life"; the best one is "white female one" and "hand-rocked cradle"; what's worse is that you can catch almost any afternoon on the Lifetime Channel. For some reason, this type of identity theft occurs exclusively for women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this type of story. You can make a woman evil at first and let the public see her flag as she hatches and implements her wicked scheme. Or you can use the wrong direction to make them look good, as a series of unplanned events seems to crash their favor until they are detected as evil in the climate scene. Unfortunately, the makers of "New Best Friend" were unable to determine how they wanted to run it and crash things and burn them early. We meet first with Alicia (Mia Kirchner) who deceives the school's financial aid office for scholarship money. We now know that she is a bad person and you will see all her subsequent activity in doubt. But it seems that the director and editor have forgotten that this revelation has been made and spend the next fifty minutes in a wrong direction setting to make us believe that Alicia is a good person. This is the only element of suspense, not about whether it is evil but about the time when the director and the editor will control and stop wasting our time with a wrong transparent direction. <br /> <br /> "Best New Friend" suffers most of the damn movie teen cast that is too old to portray college students. There are really only two parts, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirchner). Were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of production. The film works with the 26-year-old Kirchner when she plays the full version of Alicia, but becomes stark when she becomes Alicia. The choice of Monroe is just a joke, like Nicole Sheridan's attempt to try his mate at "Lizzie McGwire". It seems closer to the middle-aged crisis than looking for a term paper. <br /> <br /> Producers must be indebted to many advantages because this age problem extends to most supporting characters. Tai Dijs, who plays the city sheriff, is smaller than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic setup is that Hadley and two of the rich parties (played by Dominique Swain at age 21 and Rachel True at the age of 35) are undergrad classmates in college. (As a residence for students) in a palace that is nicer and more furnished than the palace in Real World-New Orleans (a more assertive premise than the students' football mothers). Alicia moves to the palace and begins to control Hadley's life. At least this way, Swain finally gets a roommate of her generation, so the two can get a lesbian scene. Suen's supporting performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend", and her love scene with Kirshner is wonderful, so wonderful and artistic that it does not fit into any of the other sectors, maybe a good director and a cinematographer have been subcontracted. <br /> <br /> The playful story is inadvertently presented in a series of stills teeming with pervasive sex and non-stop parties, each of which was shot by a zombie from Alicia in the hospital bed. He spends about half the time of Kirchner's screen lying motionless with a tube in his mouth. Not a good career move Mia. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
