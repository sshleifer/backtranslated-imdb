Judging by the hype, and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a terrifying horror film focused on junkies. What I got was a complete crap with a focus on junkies. I wonder if there is another film called "Fireplaces" seen by these people? There are only 3 main characters, none of which amazes me well or is well written. Basically the entire film I just spent shook my head and marveled at the stupidity of these drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Do it yourself. Do not rent this movie. Hire Cabin Fever or some other decent horror movies. Hell, hire Mary Poppins! Animated penguins are more terrifying than anything you'll find in "cookers".
