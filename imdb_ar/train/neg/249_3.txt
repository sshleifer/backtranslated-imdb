I watched this film in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how wonderful this version was. Do not get me wrong. Scott is as wonderful as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast failed very badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "Happy Birthday to all!" At other times, she left sleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on Charles Dickens' short story about a rich man who does not think Christmas is nothing but nonsense. After 30 minutes, the rich man visits three ghosts who have convinced him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this movie, with very bad text that must have been written in five minutes, can be a good rating. Instead of this piece of rubbish, I recommend you, Bill Murray's dumb comedy. At least this was funny ...
