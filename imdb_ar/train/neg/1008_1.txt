Edison's plot was respectable, but one actor in particular destroyed the entire film. Justin Timberlake destroyed the film with every line he uttered during the film. He is by far one of the worst players I have ever seen and must face the same fate as F.R.A.T. band. <br /> <br /> Whether it's an emotional scene, a moving scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake can destroy it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even bother downloading it, the porn dwarf will be a much better option. <br /> <br /> Justin, if you read this, stick to the music. Although you are not good at it, you have done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking that you can actually sing.
