I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only replacement quality is the outrageous Gore. The dubbing was worse than ever. It appears to have been filmed by a VHS video camera. I think every pfennig spent on special effects because there was too much blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst films I have ever seen, but I have to admit the abundant revolution that was not as disgusting as it could have been because the entire film is very ridiculous and unbelievable
