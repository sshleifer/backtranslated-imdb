I watched this movie on FX last night, and while I was sitting watching it, it happened to me that it was probably the worst film ever. Bad representation, bad cinema, bad voice, incredible fighting sequence at all, stupid characters. All this made it the most bad movie I have ever seen. It was so bad, I was very impressed by the absolute lack of anything quasi-efficient I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel!
