Phew - I do not do what I say. It's a film that can be really good with a group of stone viewers. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' early performances. Maybe I should take this back - I do not want to offend Waters' ability as a director. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the lawyer who deals with the requirement of "full faith and credibility". It is "total faith and trust", by the way! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of The Conrad Boys, where the lead actor is also the writer, director, film editor and so on. It may be better to leave multilateral commitments, such as those of experienced filmmakers who have the technical ability (albeit a trick, as some say) to pull something out.
