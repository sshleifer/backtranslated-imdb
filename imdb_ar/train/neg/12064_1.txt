This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, as it's absolutely terrifying, John Carradine has a very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, the story is awesome, plus I see two distortions in the end miles away! Sure, the wonderful environment and the creeping house would have helped if this was not a boring thing, and there is not one character to reach either of them, plus I hope it is down to 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally appears in the end, it is a very good scene but it is already too late, and it was the only other time in which he was exposed to the screen in the memories of the past. In addition, the only Moorish scene in the film is when a character on his face is spoiled by bees, It was rather villainous. I got it in a DVD horror series called Back From The Grave and everyone really exaggerates in my opinion, plus it's lucky that this was included in the set I bought or I'll squeeze it out the window! This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, as it's absolutely terrifying, John Carradine has a very limited screen time, and I say he avoided it like a plague! , Do not want to go through torture. Extremely terrible trend! Carl Monson is doing so terrible! Work here, make everything look cheap, waste its potential in making a creepy atmosphere and just keep the film at an incredibly boring pace. Representation is just as bad. John Carradine is good at his scene, but on the other hand he barely in the film, then the scenes of the flashback. (Cardinals ruled!). Merry Anders acts here terribly like Laura, because she has not convinced me at all. Ivy Python is fine, somewhat hustle, but also excessive, she had a creepy smile at the end. The rest of the staff, I did not pay much attention either, so I ran into a lot of trouble, but they were all very bad. Generally please avoid this, it is not worth suffering! Bomb of 5
