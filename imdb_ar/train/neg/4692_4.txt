When I first saw this movie, it was titled TERROR ON A TRAIN and the back of the feature was double. Glenn Ford, an arms expert, is called to defuse a bomb hidden in a train full of high explosives. Tension is slow and steady. This black and white film only works about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television. It has tension and drama most of its effect. This film is still as good as the standards of the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Alongside Ford are Anne Vernon and Morris Denham. The villain / villain is played by Victor Madrin.
