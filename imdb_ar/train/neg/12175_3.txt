Why do you review good films when you review "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie is very precious. I can only shoot actors and crew as they travel around L.A. Using a video camera, tossing additives into the funny, wild make-up of Tim Thomerson, a long-suffering poor man. Star families actually turn into compass toys, perhaps because the full moon can not afford the "real" additions. GIMP effects, GIMP groups, and very complex texts, it will take wits to link each node - this must be two classic transitions! <br /> <br /> So far ... and after ... he governs. Note that this is the same thing I am saying about "Trancers IV". I say that because it is true. What can you win to watch an old man in a rough coat break the zombie, then laugh out like "Do not worry about women, are they biodegradable"? Well, things can be a lot better, but anyway, these things are still good. <br /> <br /> My only important reservation is Megan Ward, which really stinks the joint. It's a poor competition for the character of Helen Hunt - both a small piece of eye candy, and it would have been more effective if it actually varied a bit more. Well, you can not get everything. At least, the great clockwork of "The Long Second Hour" appeared in place, and we have more than Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh wait a moment - he got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I have not seen this recently, but it seems like I remember that Martine Beswick was running twice during the final battle. The cry of poor continuity! Just one of the highlights of this wonderful film.
