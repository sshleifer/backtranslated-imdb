This film commits what I call an emotional rape of the bidder. The film was supposed to have caused a stir among critics at the Cannes Film Festival, but to me the last scene was just a pathetic attempt by a novice director to notice himself. Is hardly a voice in the debate on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for this matter). <br /> <br /> The transformation of the main character from the good and troubled boy to the evil rapist does not really exist, while the rape scene (being a overly exaggerated version of the rape scene from Orange Orange) is unlikely and I refuse to comment on its values Aesthetics. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To end it: brutal, disgusting, disgusting, and not worth your time. See "Orange Orange" or "Le pianiste" instead.
