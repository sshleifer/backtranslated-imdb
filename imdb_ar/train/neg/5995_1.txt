This is a really terrible film. What they did was a television show, which was never aimed at young children and gave him George Lucas's treatment (that is, by inciting him to appeal to the younger audience). <br /> <br /> Well, Thunderbirds TV was not the most common program in the brain, it was actually quite the opposite, but it was always good to see it (especially when the models exploded) and the sound crew was not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is bad behavior and misconduct (with notable exceptions from Sophia Miles in the role of Ms. Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seems to be the only members who have the slightest idea of ​​how their characters played) Farce, I will not allow Frakes to direct traffic. <br /> <br /> The main point of Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to rescue disaster participants. <br /> <br /> Avoid this litter like plague. <br /> <br /> I only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
