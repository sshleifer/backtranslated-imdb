I'm trying to photograph the stadium for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of a matrix, thinking of Bladerunner, thinking that the chick who plays Faith in Angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick like her - leave it with us - just get this - we will do it without any plot or dialogue Or personal or decent work or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick of shiny black leather running on a big throbbing bike., Right? "<br /> <br /> Brilliant, shallow, bleak, equation, emotional, boring, boring , Stupid, impolite, deceptive, barely competent. Anime live action without any action, or indeed any life. SF is just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact. :(
