To me, it seems that this film falls on his face. The main problem for me was casting Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if this is growing from just a kind of behavior or simply his behavior, but I suspect that Glover can portray a convincing evil. He is a good man, and this is always evident in his performance. Other than that the film is the range of your story mill serial killer. Nothing very innovative.
