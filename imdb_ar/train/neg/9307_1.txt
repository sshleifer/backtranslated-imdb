I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is "TRASH". Representation is done very badly. I have seen children in high school doing a better job. It seems that the entire staff seems to be reading only lines, no feeling, no passion, no room to take pictures. On the other hand, the special effects were cheese madly and the whole thing looked like it had been filmed by a camera that anyone could buy a radio hut by. <br /> <br /> The clown does not look the same as it does on the video cover. He laughed so he did not appear in the film until near the end and all he did was funny songs and wandering behind a few characters. There is no real kill offered, so this is not a real tilted film either since I saw it, I've wondered about some things 1. If it's a "crazy serial killer clown" would not that be the serial killer that kills the clowns? 2. If your friend lost why go to the jungle to have sex instead of looking for it? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is this the only real action that was ultimately spoiled in vain? Did the team finally decide to show the effort in their jobs? This film is sad as they came. My advice is to avoid renting it out lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than yelling.
