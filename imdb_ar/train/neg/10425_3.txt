This movie is awesome, it's annoying - but just the way it tells the story of BAD. Stella is terribly raw and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly arrogant and has a smaller horizon. Do not learn better than ever before. Is this realistic? In a way, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her etiquette and flashy dress, yet can not understand that she only needs to alleviate everything? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman, very good mother. Give up herself, so that her daughter can be associated with a group of fanatical fanatics is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see naturally in times - people with a beer or two, and enjoying a piano for dancing and dancing - may be considered a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not live our child that way!" Forgive me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class can never hope to aspire to heights of the upper classes. This is simply a load of hogwash.
