The reviews I read for this film were very respectable so I decided to check them out. bad idea! This is another film about a ghost out for revenge against group friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts of Ringu and one part of Prom Night, the workshops of I Know what I did last summer, and add a small dash of Single White Female - now mixed up to make no sense. There is nothing new in this plot, and revisiting the cliches I enjoyed so much was not amusing this time. This film moves from the past to a lot, and when I realized it completely, I realized that it was still irrational. The characters move from the mind to the psychological killer in the blink of an eye. When talking about characters, they are all your favorites for stereotypical ideas - greedy selfish lawyer, selfish actress, baseball star, voyeur of video, bitter girl, quiet pacif chick, lovely pretty girl, black cat freakin ... . Maybe a better writer could have worked in the film, there were some decent scenes in it, but in general it was in a mess. I must also mention a certain "video" that was impossible to portray. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst Asian horror movie has ever done, but it's still so bad. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some in the top of acting, or just want to scream "You stupid!" In a movie screen, or just want to get another Asian horror movie that appeals to you when someone asks you to see it - this movie suits you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot are looking elsewhere.
