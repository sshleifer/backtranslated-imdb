There were no big stars in this film, but he had a very good representation of excellent supporting actors and Jane Turney before becoming a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jose Calia and Cedric Hardwick, you are expecting more than the movie that has already been delivered. I think most of this is due to a second-rate scenario, where director Henry Hathaway was an efficient and well-established man in leadership. <br /> <br /> The film was shown in East Africa during the Second World War - - before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to take control of their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause trouble among the local population. One of the white men in the film is a double dealer - working to destroy the British Empire! But beautiful Terni, who plays the Sultan's daughter (!), Went out to help save Britain's Good Day. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers stood by the empire and in the 1930s and 1940s saw a large number of pro-empire films. At the present time, as the sensitivities change, the idea of ​​seeing happy black citizens dying for the Queen and the country seems ridiculous - and it will be difficult to reach any side! However, this piece of propaganda in its day was effective in raising support for the British - although when we see it today, the film suffers from a long-ring scenario and a silly cast. The only bright moment in the film is the final confrontation between George Sanders and the enemy client. Too bad After such a strong scene, the film seemed to be talking and talking - it lost some of its strength.
