We have been given this movie 2, and although I consider myself a science fiction fan, I have found this film extremely difficult. It was at AMC late at night and I'm glad I saw it for free. This film is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Special effects around the average for the time period - are not terrible, but they are not fantastic either. Of course we know more about Mars now than we knew at the time, but we can not really oppose this film. The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this film I wish I had explored in a little more detail - the injury / condition of the astronaut, a city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. In general, the film is much like a long episode of the 1960s version of the outer border - complete with a cheese end.
