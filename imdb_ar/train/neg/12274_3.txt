I usually do not say that the film is not worth watching, but this is definitely a mitigating circumstance. The only real aspect of this film is Cornelia Sharp, who seems somewhat attractive and the fact that this film is really short. <br /> <br /> The plot in the film is incredibly boring and moves almost nowhere in the film. None of the characters are remotely interesting and there is no reason to pay attention to anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to this film on Earth, but he was sure he would have succeeded in passing this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see this film is if Sean Connery dies badly and simply wants to see everything he does. Keep this one for the last though. <br /> <br /> Well, if you end up miraculously seeing this despite my assessment (or any of the other reviews on this site), I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
