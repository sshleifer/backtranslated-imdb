Is it a remake of the thing (1982/1951), I think, there are many factors from previous films deny it. <br /> <br /> So the representation is bad, and James Spiderman is doing a super-regenerating Stargate for himself, with his coffee cup and his / her thoughts / movements rather strange, but that's about it, other actors I did not even notice. Do not feel familiar with any of the main characters. The evolution of the plot is slow and boring, and I know what is about to happen within 30 minutes. The result / music is super fast, there are a lot of novice people who would achieve the results of coke and credit, but that's great nonsense. Some special effects are nice, if manufactured in the early 1990s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and excitement, do not like this movie. It is a bizarre mix between Thing, Alien 3 and Outbreak and some production by Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay. This combination would be great if someone knew what they were doing, and the only people in the production who knew it was nobody. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I will not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you wake up one cold night, and just want to look at something, it will be time slowly.
