Well, I've seen a lot of movies dealing with witches and magic but this movie was very strange. This movie begins as this witches worship led by Orson Wells is really bad playing starring (they could not get someone who looked like a demonic) and never belonged to this film. But in any case, the dough takes a new member and stabs a doll resembling someone and makes her suffer from abortion. The lady who was suffering from abortion and her husband burst into a place called Lilith at work, while the lady sees a picture of her sister or her contacts and warns her to stay away from her and never use her powers there or will die. The couple, having settled in the bizarre town, discover that all the inhabitants are all charming, that they have become curious and frightened of all their neighbors and friends. Then the strange things begin to reveal that the funeral procession is going on a hill that suddenly disappears (was crawling) and the sight of the little boy belonging to Orson Wells in the playgroud that he is asking the lady later to help him get back to life. The woman soon tries to escape from the town but only to find herself confined to her inhabitants and her powers and find herself ignoring all that the soul is trying to warn him of. This film is fine, it's moments of suspense but it could have done much better than having Orson there.
