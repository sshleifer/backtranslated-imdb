I knew this movie would not be great, but I thought I would give it a chance. I'm a Block Wilson fan, so I thought it had potential. Unfortunately, a lot of dialog boxing sounding and cheese was very fake. I think Aquafresh gave some money for film production because they were dropping some hints seriously. There is a screenshot where the Aquafresh sign appears on you so you can not but notice it. Maybe they should concentrate on writing and acting more than the number of times we can drop Aquafresh's products in the film without bothering people. The film took its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to watch it at the theater.
