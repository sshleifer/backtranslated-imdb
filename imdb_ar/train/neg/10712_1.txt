This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever, and I stress it. What's worse, my old heroine is dolph in it and he's starring. Jesus ... The story is really good, but the way I carried it made my body painful. The fighting scenes for beginners are well designed as a conflict between two drunks coming out of the bottom. Actors, with the exception of Dolph, which also absorbs Kinda, perform very poorly and can not help you but you wonder if the reason for their presence is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way should be absent, if not all the time. This is $ 12 million was spent in an unimaginable way, because through the look of the effects and landscape, the cost can not be higher than 100 per cent.
