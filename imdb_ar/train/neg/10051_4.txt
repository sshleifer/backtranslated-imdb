This was given 4 stars because it contains a lot of interesting topics already mentioned by many. From domestic violence, to sexual activity and many taboos in it. Outside the seminar, I did not call this horror as much as I call science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's dark, depressing and desperate. Although I do not mind the low-end cheerful, I am very tired of the cliches that "suck people" which are essential to every film. I know that you can not get a degree in liberal arts today without bowing to changing self-hatred as a member of the human race. But how do we pick up as a writer / director, claiming that we are different from anyone else in the package? Now, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out and find a lake and swim until your arms are tired. In this way, you will not be there to direct the next movie or write the next book that tells me I deserve to die because I'm alive. It's silly, not thoughtful, and boring.
