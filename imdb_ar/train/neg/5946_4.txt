There is no plot at all in this film ... There is no personal development ... no peak ... nothing. But has a few good fighting scenes that are actually very good. There you go ... The gross movie is very bad, but if you like the flick that does not take place and offers nothing but a good motion scene, watch this movie. Do not expect anything more. Decent behavior and direction is not so bad ... a couple of gems from kimbo and karano ... I was looking forward to seeing a little more karano in this movie .. he is a good fighter and a really hot girl .... white is a great martial artist and decent actor. I really hope he can get a better film in the future so we can really enjoy his art .. Imagine a movie with White and Ga together ... it would be great
