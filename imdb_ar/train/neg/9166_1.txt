Recherche is a good word to describe this film. <br /> <br /> Let's say that every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. Transformers stunt are wonderful effects as well as nostalgic boys fans. Sleeping in a gimmick in Seattle is an apparent situation in his description line, "What if you have never met a person, someone you've never seen before, and someone you've never known before is the only person for you?" Many of the romans rely heavily on these tricks and some by pulling big names. Leap Years employs both the use of Irish folklore as a circumstance and displays largely famous names within the country. <br /> <br /> So that the audience now in the cinema, along with all the usual elements of characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolve and cancellation, are also looking to stimulate dialogue, more accommodating positions as a result of jumping years, interesting sub plots, and perhaps , To some extent, a good development in the middle or near the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean-Yue is trying not to achieve. If they tried, their goal was clear on the other pitch, on the other pitch, at the other end of the planet. She and her writer Alan Laerak have failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most lines were contrived. They seem to have a bag full of lines that she wants to use in her film: "Well, these are the lines and quotations I've heard or read from any of the movies I've seen or the books I've read before and they all look good to me. Good for the public, so all I have to do is assemble them all. The result is healing. I can not say that the lines were not necessary and had nothing to do with the story or the plot, but it seems no longer exists anywhere, to draw your attention to these borrowed quotations. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people quoting quotations based on most of the positions in our dialog, trying to make them meaningful to themselves while nodding. I no longer go with them because the desire to pressure them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Second, the characters filmed are ridiculous and one-dimensional. Except for the abnormal dialogue that indicates their motives (necessary to push the plot), there was no sense of condemnation. I have no idea who they are. They are all streamlined lines from the tips column in a women-oriented magazine. <br /> <br /> The trick in leap years is not enough to direct the story because the conditions are too shallow. Then again, there are fewer films but better than that, right. They made it with my first and second points. Moreover, the sub plots are not important (not that they are bad for the movies) and thin (something bad). <br /> <br /> Jean-Yue and the producers are trying to pass the terrible plot with fantastic locations and acceptable photography. This is because they may understand that it is possible and easier to get the approval of some viewers than others with good use of cinema, soundtrack and photography site. These are non-discerning viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that it's good. It's just bad. You do not see this.
