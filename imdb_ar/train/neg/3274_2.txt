Again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget, and Thunderbirds, a TV series is converted into a full-length movie and destroyed for all the hundreds of people who watched it. Basically, the Duke's cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Sean William Scott) in Hazard County, spend a lot of time driving very quickly in "General Lee". But they need to unify their work and prevent the destruction of their family farm with the whole town almost by Jefferson Davis 'boss' Hoge (nominated by Bert Reynolds) to make room for a huge coal mine. They get help from their cousin, sexy Daisy (Jesse Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while Sheriff Rusco Coltran (Lost McJenie) and the police are chasing them. He starred Joe Don Becker as Jim Aploit, Jack Polek as vice-president of Claus Hogan, David Kouchner as Couture Davenport, Michael Weston as Enos Strati's deputy and Linda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason to give the film an extra star is because of some impressive stunts in the car, and of course the wonderful Simpson body (I'll admit that her legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but I'm still!), But also very boring. Nominated for the Razzies for Worst Picture, the worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, and the worst in a remake or sequel, for the worst screen movie for Simpson & Her "Daisy Dukes" and worst-case scenario. Very poor!
