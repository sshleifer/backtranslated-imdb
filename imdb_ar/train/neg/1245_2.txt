Definitely the worst film after Burton, who seems to be getting worse with every film he runs. The miserable script full of vulgar words is just the first of many controversial aspects of this film. This is the kind of movie that happens every time something happens, and you'll be sure to hear someone shout "He's lost his weapon!" Or whatever it is to tell everyone. Carter is really terrifying as well as Flberg, who can not play straight and be convincing. Very beautiful effects and photography, but poor music in the form of John Williams by Burton Elfman. Heston appears in a senseless scene to highlight his most famous phrases in the first film. Too bad results. <br /> <br /> If anyone else sees Sleepy Hollow, they may have noticed, as I said, the low quality of Burton movies. I have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgment must be questioned. But I think he allowed any possible vision he might have had early in his career to come down; the evidence is in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow", he could not determine what kind of film he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror film, and the representatives of the British characters (Chris Lee, etc.) also thought it was a kind of rally monster (these are not scary) Never, as fans know horror). The film did not succeed in horror or comedy because it was very schizophrenic, and no style was developed to calm the two. "Planet of the Apes" is the same way, and the result comes more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" more like science fiction. He has also fallen into the midst of many other "big" directors trying to please the entire potential audience. Send a word to Burton, if you're out - choose something and do it straight, or use some elegance to suggest all together (as in "Mars attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or maybe retire too, because people love me because your movie fans will stop going.
