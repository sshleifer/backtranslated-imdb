A scary film meaningless and worse. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, there are no characters beyond the most imaginative stereotypes, and it is based on an eccentric central concept that is not particularly original and is not treated in a mysterious and innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is completely wasting what was supposed to be his answer to Jim Carrey's Truman show, replacing his usual routine of screaming (admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well, to Pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is no more than a mild fury (some of the reviews I have read here to talk about Oscar nomination are laughable) while Maggie Gillenhal does an acceptable job with a very weak script that allows nothing but to prove her character as a student A previous law came out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. Please. If it ended up falling in the "personality" Ferrell was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Mark Forster's attempts to jazz in the film using computer graphics only highlight the uninspiring stuff he works with. <br /> <br /> I had the option of either going to see The Prestige for the third time or seeing this. I wish I had chosen Prestige.
