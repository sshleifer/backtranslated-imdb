I read some good reviews on this forum for "Mr. Scarface", but for anyone who is not creative in this type of Italian gangster films like me, the picture may not be logical at all. In fact, after the initial setup, which includes ten million lira fraud, the image turned into a fairly routine retaliation with a slight evolution in the character identity of Rick (Al Cleaver). The whole guerrilla plot for me was broken by the inclusion of Vincenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he speaks of the only person who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unreasonable that the people of Manzari who chased Tony in the streets did not actually fail even before Tony put a hand on them. Despite all his accumulation as a title character, Jack Ballance has been somewhat unevenly wasted in the finale of the impact near the end, making the title of American work "Mr. I've seen enough Western Spaghetti to know they are not all working; I think in this case, my first look at the gang flick did not make that either.
