Haunting is a new version of horror horror with a lot of special spoofing effects on the screen that has no replacement features at all, except for cinematography. I assume that the representatives of A-List (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, the silly special effects and the terrible attempts to frighten her audience, but this is not a popular magazine that does not care who we care about. The story of the film is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and grabbing four seasons and then using anything left for the film. Many of them are unexplained. The characters are very fine, while acting is good, but you do not really care about any of the characters at all. Laila Taylor performs wonderfully and sounds like 8 years old when she gives her lines, not to mention her terrible screams. Laila Taylor does not make this kind of horror at all. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, looking like a group of Casper's Friends Ghost and a ghost "Hugh Caen" looks like a fat man in dark gloomy clothes wearing Halloween with a smoke machine. This creature is located on the surface of one of the rooms with a giant purple mouth and is not funny even unintentionally. Beautiful and well designed which is probably the only positive thing in this film which looks nice but this does not save it from everything brutal. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV without the price. So, I'd be more $$ if I had paid to see it but fortunately it was on the screaming channel. In general, Haunting is a tedious new edition trying to overcome you with bad special effects, an awesome attempt at horror.
