This is a very bad film. The plot is an emotional herd. I assume that the production values ​​are fine, decent photography, the trend is unobtrusive and all that. Mark Hamel was terrible. I have never cared much about him, and this film validates this perception. No wonder he did not have any kind of profession apart from his Star Wars films. I will just say "Buh-bye, Mark" and it drowns in a worthy ambiguity. On the other hand, the young Annie Potts was stolen from the parade completely. I have definitely shown magic, beauty and acting in one performance. I remember seeing her in Texasville recently and was informed of her beauty. It's interesting to see her ten years ago. However, unless you're interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie screaming for the hills.
