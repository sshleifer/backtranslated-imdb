Summer Vacation is the forgotten musical version of Oh Wilder in Eugene O'Neill and deserves it by Broadway musical composition Take Me Along. With the exception of Stanley Steamer, none of the other songs Harry Warren-Ralph Blane deserves to remember, and even one song is questionable. <br /> <br /> MGM has released this movie directly to Mickey Rooney and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was produced in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old and played Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was too old for the 17-year-old who influenced extremist ideas in a spirit of young rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films for the MGM from 1946 to 1948, this movie is Killer McCoy remake of Robert Taylor and Crowd Crowds, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and the lyrics and music. In each of them Rooney played the role of an adult. Even in the film Andy Hardy, Mickey played Andy Hardy's adult people back from World War II. Why was this Louis B. Meyer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's poor performance makes the summer vacation worse because in the original Ah Wilderness film, the focus is on the character of Walter Huston's father. At Takeway Along, which won Tony's Jackie Gleason Award in Broad Broadway, Great One played the role of his deep-seated friend Mr. Sid Frank Morgan, the pivotal character. <br /> <br /> Gloria has gone over De Haven as Judy Garland as Ronnie's beautiful and wonderful friend, and Marilyn Maxwell plays the role of the girl who gives Rooney adult education. In the original play, O'Neill had a prostitute, but this was Hollywood of the Code, all Marilyn does is motivate young Rooney. <br /> <br /> Many truly talented people have a hand in this one and do their best, but the summer holidays quickly fade into a cold autumn.
