Well, this movie started funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult" teaser based on the first few moments, but then the film turned into a bad Disney Channel, especially the incredibly long go-kart scene. Alana de la Garza is wonderful but the Italian accent is really fake. The film looked very budget-independent and low. There was one very nice moment which I would call only on the singing scene but in general this was one of yawning. Laughter is very few and far apart. The final surprise of "Mr. Fix It" is so ironic that it left me crazier than anything else. It may be worth watching if you can take it for free or TV but do not waste your money buying or renting this movie.
