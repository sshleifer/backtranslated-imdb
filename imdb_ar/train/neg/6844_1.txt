I have a copy of this on the VHS, I think it (TV networks) should play this every year over the next twenty years. So do not forget what it was and we remember not to make the same mistakes again. Such as putting some people on a manager's chair, where they do not belong. Rappin is similar to Vodvillian's music, for those who can not sing or act. This film is as enjoyable as its attempt to teach the "blind" driving the city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) just got out of jail and returned to the old neighborhood. In the time of service to the crime of the overall necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by old ladies' dogs and their peers dancing and singing all the way. <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you are emotional, or if you are in fact someone who was smoking a medical container prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Either way, this is poorly directed, scripted, acted and even produced (I did not think I sat it) satire of Jewish life with "Hood". Although I believe that the retreating part of the story, through the series of fighting gangs and dance figures, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the Jewish quarter from demolition and cleaning. <br /> <br /> Forget that Sonny Spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for this rap. Well, if you find yourself wanting to laugh at yourself silly and three quarters awkward, make sure you drink it first. <br /> <br /> Please, see responsibly. (No stars, good luck next time!)
