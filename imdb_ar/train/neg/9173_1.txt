I have never seen a film before. <br /> <br /> It is possible to take a video game shootem up and make it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: There are absolutely no contacts at all. In this film, not associated with any of the characters because ... you will not get a chance. <br /> <br /> The only person who is sympathetic or interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the film's results are meaningless because all the characters were lifeless from the start. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst shooting scene ever. I love battles. I love when the heroes open to the demons and clean house. Heck I even like watching a badguy home sometimes. But this gun battle was strange, and I think the best way to describe it is "indifferent" I have seen people shoot more emotion and emotion while playing video. In this film he looked and felt like "actors" were simply walking in the filming of everything moving without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where does trash talk? Where are the grunts of anger amid the shooting? These are supposed to be children who have been in a bad dilemma ... but even the real soldiers are acting professionally and mercilessly to their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a good horror film about a secluded house full of monsters, I recommend Sam Rami Evil Dead. Do not see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all copies of this film.
