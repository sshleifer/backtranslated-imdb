Ronald Coleman won Best Actor Oscar for his dazzling performance as a popular playwright who loses himself completely in his roles, especially in Othello to Shakespeare. George Cuckur's critically acclaimed film, written by Roth Gordon and Garrison Kanin, Unfortunately, the witty joke comes self-conscious here, and the behind-the-scenes business is overpriced. Miklós Rózsa won the Oscars for his group, and Shelley Winters has a couple of wonderful moments and a tough waitress (when Coleman talks to her relentlessly, I ask him, "What kind of nut?"). Other than that, this scenario is horribly clear, surprising, and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
