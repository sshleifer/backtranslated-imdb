Once in a while in Indian cinema a movie like Cholay changes the way the audience looks to a good film. Once we hate each period (hopefully) we have RGV ki Aag which breaks all criteria and creates its own one. Very low level, can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma has been able to take some talent away and make a plate so that it can smell from a distance. The shooting of a classic film like Cholay and his assassination is absolutely unforgivable and I can not believe he called it RGV ki Sholay. Although Cholay contained many elements of folklore, the film was able to build on his plan by defining characters so distinctly that they lived on them forever. What Aag does is to take these characters and spoil them badly, you will need a contest to choose the worst. The element of realism is completely missing and what the film ends is a group of "actors" who perform casually in a group of less seemingly unrelated events. One star for this film is a silly waste of vote. It is time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and to conjure up another "different" conspiracy that can be classified under the cinema.
