My wife is fanatic regarding this show. As such, I bought their seasons from I to III, and the fourth season is in demand. Personally I think the show is a big farce, as the cast is just as bad. Elissa Milano should have stuck to other trash films she made, such as Poison Ivy and Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few. Other women who support the cast members are incompetent in their portrayal. I've seen better special effects in the old republican series of pictures I saw as a child. I can understand why the male horses stayed in the show for short periods of time although I do not know whether or not they choose them. Please. Please do not renew for another enough season enough, Bob
