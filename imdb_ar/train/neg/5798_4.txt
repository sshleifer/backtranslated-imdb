This film is a rather strange mix of music, romance, drama and crime with the sniff of his Noir film. It's basically a mess pile of different types, none of which works as it was supposed to. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be more serious as an actor. He is a former child star who has always been used to performing in a comedic and musical comedy at the beginning of his career. In this film, he chose a different method (although the musical aspects still exist in the film). But his role is actually very funny within the film. Does Mickey Rooney mean a strong player? He is a very young boy. He was already in his thirties at the time of this film, but he seems to be seriously more than 16 years old. His hearing says "babe" to women and he talks hard with gangsters who are over three times their size and do not look good. It is simply unconvincing in its role. <br /> <br /> Since the film mixes many different species, the story also looks like chaos. There is somewhere criminal conspiracy, and somewhere, there is a romantic conspiracy line and one about living your dream, but none of that really succeeds because of anarchist approach and dealing with everything. It's not just an interesting or compelling film to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has only had 10 films in his life, although his career extends from 1935 until 1957. He had to be a mature director who had difficulty getting a job in the industry and instead once in a while I was given less script to work with. All his films are unknown, as they are usually not very high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's also not forget that this film is from the 1950s, but it seems to be more than the movie "Forty" or perhaps a sponsor of 30. This is mostly due to the fact that this film was filmed Black and white. Black and white films of the 1950s are often of a mostly cheap appearance, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a rather strange sight where Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band see themselves performing together in sequence. This was not Armstrong's only film, and he often surfaced in this type of film, often himself. I think jazz fans can still enjoy watching this movie to some extent because of its music, because there is a lot of it in this film. The film actually won Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. <br /> <br /> A small awkward movie and a picnic of Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
