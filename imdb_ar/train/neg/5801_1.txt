Ivan (Valery Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist investigating the unjustified. He travels to this small town where the Ita Ever is said to have terrorized society. <br /> <br /> His car stops and turns into a small building, and meets a mysterious young girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon and kills her, and the city wonders who killed this woman ... who I think was charming but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is now pursuing her spirit, or something, and must have faith, or something, to overcome. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually full of lame actors, stupid story and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian film ... but a foreign film too. The voice actor for Evan made the film more a comedy of horror, because it is high-tone and pure. You will not miss much by losing this movie.
