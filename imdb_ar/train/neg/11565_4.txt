So now after the second week of "beauty color", I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some good behavior, as long as we except it is just a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure people feel that this fantasy drama is a "realistic" coverage of Thatcher years - it's fine as a drama, but I feel that the award-winning book is still much better. I wonder if the BBC will give us follow-up and the next part of the drama and the following years with "things can get better" with the completion of 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! With this promise from a government full of corruption.
