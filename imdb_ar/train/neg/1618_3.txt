I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw Jack's previous film (The Penguin March) and I heard a very positive review of this film on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Most of all, this film is terribly boring. Nothing happens literally. I tried to describe the content of the film to a friend, and we ended up laughing because I could only spoil things like, "Well then it comes winter, then spring, then there is an eagle and a river, and once it's dark, the girl goes to the cave, Children "and so on. About half an hour later I began to sigh, yawn, roll my eyes, cursing references at the radio station, and I hope it will end soon. But the film continued. When it finally ended, I sank so deep into the chair that I had to look somewhat like Stephen Hawking. The most disturbing part of the film is (a) the girl, who is obviously there to provide the children with someone to sympathize with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire film (one year), and shows exactly two expressions: Joy and Seriousness. It's nice, no doubt about it. However, a film about the beauty of nature such a film could have been better without its human existence. I always found myself hoping to be eaten by a bear, or sink into the river, or something equally terrible. (B) To comment in the voice of the adult girl, who only tells us things that are neither remembered nor remembered, nor dull and unnecessary. (C) music, which lacks very precision. When the girl jumps happily, the music jumps too. When the Eagle threatens the fox, music becomes threatened too. Reminded me of the early days of filmmaking, I was very much expected to enjoy it. Admittedly, many of the children who saw the film with me were clearly impressed, at least in some way involved. Therefore, my warning concerns only adults: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
