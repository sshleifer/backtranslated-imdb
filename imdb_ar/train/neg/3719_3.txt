Imagine pulling a lethal killer mask and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening showed a promise, but soon all the pretense of being an exciting movie (or even a fantasy love story) was reduced. The only reason they made this story becomes very clear: filling the gap in the women's watch market by creating a re-segmentation Other than the "bad boy misunderstood" (Andrei) meets the "innocent," the whimsical beauty '(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting any time in creating an original hypothesis, filmmakers went straight for the money: the evil boy who was tame by that eccentric beauty. And then follows a series of unusual scenes of love and cliches filled with philosophical fuzzy / false poetry. Andre is recognized as a "poet" to overcome the perceived qualities that Byron should have - but even when we are told of the written writing of who he is, it is still hard to believe. - or care. <br /> <br /> For the super hero / heroes to work, the story needs precision, elegance and innovation - all of which are completely absent here. This is not a modern day of Phantom of Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and somewhat silly woman (with Flexible Lime Flexibility) dates to a bad man, who seems to be having a serious encounter like rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances may have saved this film, if it had been good. Women's leadership is exciting and "strange to the world," no matter how overwhelming or ridiculous it may be; the poor Dougrey Scott seems to have been anesthetized and ashamed of his side. This is not his best. Luster brought attention by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as "Fashun" and Andrew Lee Potts the young photographer / brother. It was better for a film to hide the sister and keep it instead.
