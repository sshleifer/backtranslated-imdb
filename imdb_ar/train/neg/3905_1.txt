Forget the plan 9, this is a fiasco, theatrical drama, inefficiently directed, written, actress, etc. This film is based on the novel by Isabel Allende that was not much better. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Hispanic films), and other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are trying hard to get such a terrible scenario. Lots of mistakes (like, for example, since when the Christmas snowfall in Chile?) Are very harsh, with tons of this evil called "magical realism", which stands out as the worst film of all time. Suck completely!
