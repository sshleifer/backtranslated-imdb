<br /> <br /> Once you've overlooked some possibilities, this was in fact a fairly decent horror / monster fit. So, I'll give you some good points first: - The dragon was very convincing, especially as she was scouring the tunnels for lunch (hint: she likes humans). - The work was fairly non-stop, and after a weak start, I completely absorbed the story. - Sorry to say, I was sparkling with the dragon - perhaps the most convincing character in the film. <br /> <br /> Now for unreasonable things ** Maybe some spoilers **: - If you are looking for a fire vent dragon in 1100 AD, will you ship in its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm? Doh. - A feminine figure with a full American name, blonde hair and a clear Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Hey? - A leading scientist whose Slavic dialect you can tell with a knife, supposedly born in Chicago, educated in the United States of America? - A military helicopter pilot doing his own repairs, flying a huge transport plane without another crew, is he an expert in shooting and a combat soldier to take off? Okay. Ah huh I will not mention that he gave three different call signs within two minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some Japanese monster hits of the 1960s, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although it is natural that the end will end in leaving this possibility open wide. Or, perhaps, they will appoint a real manager next time. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, this click has been given 4 out of 10. Add 2 others if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Kane gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Smile>
