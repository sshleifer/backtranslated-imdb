This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Morel (Charlotte van den Indy) the youngest, Laura (Els Dautermans), 37 years old and Marta (Frida Bittoroz) older than Morrell's mother. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations for life. Laura bio want a baby. Morel from the village wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreamed of her youth when she was a little girl. In fact, nothing happens in this film, so waiting for something - sometimes for an accident - may lead to dramatizing this story. Over time, she discovers that director Dorothy van den Bergy does not want to develop a psychological image of the three women and nothing else. This movie is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences and this is not the case, so there is one sense of emptiness.
