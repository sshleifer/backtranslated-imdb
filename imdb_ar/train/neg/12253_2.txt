I did not actually think that the film could be so terrible, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was awful and for a stupid sex / murder scene in each one, this was a bad step from the word go. I've been really shocked and this is not a compliment! How can someone make this movie and watch it again and say, "Yes, this is a good film, people will watch it." If you do not see it, I beg you not :-(
