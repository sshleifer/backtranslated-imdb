Valdemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is watered by Yeti, causing him to become a wolf. He was accidentally killed after he attacked his deceptive wife and her lover, and was later revived by a scientist, Dr. Ilona Erman, whom she uses in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovered an underground shelter inhabited by strange people in the failed doctor's experiments. <br /> <br /> When I hear the death of Naschy from his colleague John Keithley, I searched through my collection for a film suitable for watching it. In my arms, I found that I had only one copy (three copies) of "The Wrath of the Wolf". The film is characterized by dubious video quality, dubbed sound in a modest way, and cinema is a kind of occasional teasing style. American versions have two love scenes removed. Quite frankly, without a new, undivided version, I did not really achieve the right film with all its glory. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series of Count Valdemar Daninsky. I think this is true, but you will not know it from the film itself. The plot is sometimes confusing, and there is no indication that this is a supplement. If you read the conspiracy summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you'll see that I'm not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film's shortcomings can be omitted if we understand the production hell has passed. While it was floating for years, it was only released in 1973 because of the problems involved in finding a distributor. Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was a liquor addict and that he hated working with him. These really are not light charges, and I have no idea what Zabalza said on his behalf. <br /> <br /> You may sooner or later encounter a low-quality version of Wolfen's "Fury." It appears in a variety of three groups and boxes, so you may get it by mistake and do not know it. It really is a non-polished American version, with a decent mix of audio and video, and the scenes of love that have been put in. To my knowledge, this does not exist, let us honor Paul Nashchi's legacy and convey his films to a wider audience of the quality he deserves.
