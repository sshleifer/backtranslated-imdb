There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and talented singer. After all, very few actors these days can get a good view in one shot and this was the way Sinatra worked in a good position. <br /> <br /> I feel that with the beginning of the sixties, the quality of the man really began to film the tank. The Tony Rome detective series was less than trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series, which appeared at the same time. Maybe even the James Bond contest, but nothing really worked for Frank during these years. His personal life in a state of chaos, his music faded ... Sinatra looked like a rebound to the 1950s. Another major Sinatra film in this period was probably von Ryan Express in 1965.
