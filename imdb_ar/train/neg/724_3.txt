The Sarafina concept seems well understood, away from the musical perspective. Trying to combine African music with a story that describes the terrible conditions and atmosphere that blacks forced him to endure at the time the film was made. The contradictions of both elements are very blatant and the film never justifies such rapid transitions between rejoicing and terrorism. If it were just a drama that reflected these circumstances, it might be a good film, but the scenes of schoolchildren dropped by soldiers do not sit well next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the bad hypothesis, acting is not the best either. Goldberg performs modestly as other actors do. Overall disappointed. <br /> <br /> 3/10
