This film had some of the butrinine kickers, but it is an old story that can never happen. Navy protocols can not collapse so much that a crew less than XO can reach this limit against the captain. I will have Dr. Strangelov on any day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
