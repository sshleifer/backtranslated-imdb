Well, so I understood it. We are supposed to be terrified. The idea was planted. Girl takes her father and take pictures of her. Call me on this kind of rock but I invite you to provide clear details of what I did before I could bear this. But do not expect me to watch an angry porno, and I feel appalled by her "father" ... I mean that this convention has not been misused in the making of movies for adults that are already penetrated by "rape and sexual harassment" ... horror is not what your mind can fool you to believe . This is what actually exists in the film. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Radiation becomes moderate when it becomes your own adventure.
