Watching this movie, as you just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which you label as "Dangerous Female"), can double your estimate of the Bogart Astor version 1941. Ricardo Cortez must be paid for the smell. I hope that his dentist and seller Brylcreem remembers him in his will; they made him the actor. The whole women are good, but not better. Well, Ona Merkel a little better. The most interesting is Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, the "original", who provide a lot of involuntary crap with almost nothing about the changing atmosphere of their role models, Peter Laurie and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow bypassed the core seed of their characters in a remake; here, Sam Speed ​​and Ruth Wonderley (!) Can not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not quite stink; it lies there like a large slice of pork. Today's key value is a reminder that great movies such as '41 'Falcon' are not just happening. On the scale from 1 to 10, I set it as 4, mainly for camera work and supporting players.
