And forget about this. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna acting, and hired "Body of Evidence", at least there is Willem Defoe in this film. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the groups are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialogue. You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is lost, and Jean Treblehorn is a pillar, and Madonna is extremely awful, becoming amusing. Why they forced the original film butcher in this mess, I will never know; think they think it was "banking." Madonna, as an actress, is certainly not. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie in 1979, you will enjoy it, and its actors can actually act. 10/01.
