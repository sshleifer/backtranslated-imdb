This TV movie is all talk, little work. She is working hard to prepare her twisted scheme, yet the writing is very confusing, and the exhibition is still cloudy at best. In the end, I did not know more about these characters than I did at the beginning. He has a script about "Ten Little Indians," but he gives up half-way to highlight Sally Field and reveal a killer. The field of exaggeration here with its luster rarely seen from them. Early submissions are good, but writing quickly disappears and eventually transcends the summit. Lots of hysteria, thunder effects and persistent lightning (which add nothing). A strange failure of producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, can they not give us anything more than a text full of red herring and Sally Field hiding in a closet?
