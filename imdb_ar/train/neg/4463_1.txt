This is one of those movies that make you want the time you spend watching it again, and then some, like the time I spent picking it up accidentally, the time I spent getting to the video store, etc. <br /> <br /> First, appearance: it's grainy, it's a low budget. Now this in itself does not make for a bad film. But the way they are photographed makes the procedure seem unnatural, so this is a kind of distraction. <br /> <br /> Then, the story. 3 Girls go on a gal weekend away from men. Of course, as everyone does when going on a camping trip, they stop in the way to get earrings. When they arrive at the area where they will stay, they are pulled out by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car during the fire season, and then leads them to their places of departure. (Remote compartment). Of course, two "nice guys" are walking nearby, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubrey are instantly enthralled, but Bambi seems to be fond of anything with two legs. Madi was somewhat disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting the former by getting sh ** - faced with stones and stoned with her husband. <br /> <br /> Oh, I almost forgot, there's an old-fashioned old-timer in this way, maybe someone is not intertwined with him, and the area and cabin they live in have a kind of "reputation." <br /> <br /> Of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, later) some wood visitors on the weekend start to die, and find many booby traps (although actually a little less than that) and of course , The rest of the camp feel upset. There is no mobile phone reception of course (who will not have the chance to check his mobile phone for reception in a movie anymore?). Mr Ranger Sir continues to appear at odd times and his behavior seems a little strange but he says he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful twist to this that you will not want to miss too, if you are still awake. Pray to wake up on a blank screen. <br /> <br /> Acting in this is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and the whole task is just lame and I find it amazing that this has been released. Avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.
