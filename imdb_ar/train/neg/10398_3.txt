There is nothing wrong with popcorn movie to keep you away from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is so bad. The representation is terrible, the script is dangerous. The special effects are overpriced. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat its audience with such contempt? Why did they make a sequel?
