First of all, I thought it was naughty to say in the credits that the story and the scenario for Preston Sturgis. Sturgis was one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood until his talent faded and retired. However, Preston Storges was not Preston Storges Junior. The story was based primarily on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes into possession of a wicked being who gives him any desire but in the end he will destroy him to hell. this is good. No one said the script writers should be original. Actors are generally competent in view of the modest writing they had to translate on the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero believes he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem a little differently in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first, this seems to have worked, but with the symbol of the modern horror film, they feel they have to present a final doll of horror at the end of the film. This is a stupid agreement. The old horror movies got along well with the hero being allowed to win in the end. There is nothing wrong with a good victory over evil, regardless of what the current crop of filmmakers seems to think about. You can give the audience a good health fear and still make them feel happy in the end. In fact, I think it is better.
