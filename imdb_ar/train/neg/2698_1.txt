This film shows how racist John Singleton is. It depicts eggs and other races that are not as black as evil present in our educational system. How forgotten that this educational system itself is what made it and failed. The character of Ice Cube is an example of a provocative black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the black and white characters who were trying to reach each other. When Omar Ebs said "I need to be with my people," I spoke that racist observation. And John, do not think for a minute that the image of Thomas Jefferson in the Tower of stairs did not get my attention to a beautiful touch!
