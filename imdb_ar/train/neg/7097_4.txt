Enjoy this cheap B Class movie ruthlessly on all its sights and effects and so on to make you think it spent 80% of its budget on Connery. It looks like watching some Wing Commander items after Star Wars (completely away from content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. Oh God, I can not remember the villain who has not been interested in a long time. We did not give any reason for being too evil (an inherent flaw, we are thinking) and no conviction or real inclination to evil. <br /> <br /> If you are out of Conrey instead go rental `Forster Hunting.
