I agree with one of the others comments book about the good story and the good but mismatched actors, I would also say that he rushed. I've been around 24 years since I read the book as it was at school. But I felt you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this story where bits are neglected and therefore completely meaningless. For example, Jain & Rochester barely talked and suddenly proposed marriage !!! Representatives do not have time to tell the audience what their personality feels about everything that happens in the story. The actors are good, but they do not give enough time to bring this story to justice. I'm sorry to say that, but I did not really enjoy this release. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C. Scott will be Jane Eyre's favorite film but you should check out the 1983 BBC mini-series with Zila Clarke and Timothy Dalton in the main roles 2. I love her a lot and watch it regularly. There is a shortened version of 225 minutes or the full version of 330 minutes.
