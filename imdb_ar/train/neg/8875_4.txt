If this movie is "preferred" to someone, they will need some serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I have not seen the original movie this is a remake of (some fifties movies), but simply must be better than this new bass. <br /> <br /> A pilot is dismissed from the army as a marginal element, and the children's education ends at the ROTC. Unfortunately, the pioneer is Daman Wayans ... so the children are in a world of distress and distress without spirit. Can Wayans defeat these losers in shape? Could it make him become a little more humane? The movies explode as do most of the Wynns movies, with only sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, which is very small. This charming old man (known to me as the "Tales of the Cellar", known to you as Uncle Lewis of "Christmas Holiday") shines every moment he appears on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also appears as a biker, which fits him perfectly. I did not mind a bit more than Bam Bam, but I think he played as a "biker" as much as a military film. <br /> <br /> Then there's the attractive teacher, who drops someone on Major Payne, although he treats children badly, has no social skills and can not be turned into someone you want to spend time with. You must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure about that (although he may seem "stupid" because the film shows she often leaves the house). <br /> <br /> Wayans encountered a bright moment: a dance sequence where he sings a series of moves (including a very cute "robot") and with the help of 2 Live Crew's music. This scene was fun but barely made for anything else that made this dog a difficult dog. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie, it's a loser who helps losing children become heroes, or renting or buying "Ernest Goes to Camp." At least he is a beloved loser, and really funny. Perhaps if Major Pine Al Ghurair fought against me, I would feel better, but he did not. Forget Pine, Forget Wayans ... You can do much better.
