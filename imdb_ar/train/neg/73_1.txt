This must be the worst piece of rubbish I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a huge heart? He looked distorted. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts are real-life elements because I spent two hours of my longest hours wondering what you saw. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a famous heart? With a loose beard look and deer at the front of his headlights, I can not say I'm OK. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths were the same as usual, but Jeffrey Rush looked like he could not wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I feel sorry for bankers and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually an amusing film. This was vulgar, vulgar and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would improve. did not happen. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or so was an unexpected joy. Heath and his gang hide in a hotel on the border, and women and children die because of their presence. This is not funny. But it was fun when they came out of the hotel wearing armor, because all we could think of was the black knight of Monte Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting to say "I'll hit your leg!" We were laughing, as were many disfigured members of the public. When we left, everyone was talking about the loss of time for this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had not paid my money to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly was not free. It cost me two hours of my life and I will never go back to it.
