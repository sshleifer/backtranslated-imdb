I had expected many science fiction movies and thrills this summer but I was very disappointed about this particular film. While some people came out of the film, decided to stay, just to laugh with other filmgoers in acting, lack of suspense, funny result, it is difficult to follow the story line. I found myself at a loss as my main character in the film. The quality of the only movie replacement was soundtrack. This is one of the emerging star films that they later regret. When going back, I did not rent this one, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see it.
