These Naschy strolls are guided in 1974 by Leon Klimovsky, and may lead you to a quick look at propaganda images and packaging to believe that this medieval Middle Ages is somewhere between the "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately no. <br /> <br /> This is a strict PG relationship with a tortoise torture sequence, no nudity and no small edge at all. Naschy (whom I admire) smiles his songs in the name of Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately Pantomime is more of a villain than anything else. One feels the film we've seen (and done) before. So accurately for Naschy is only complete.
