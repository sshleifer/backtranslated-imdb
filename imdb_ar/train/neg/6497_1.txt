I actually had high hopes of going to this movie, so I took what was given a grain of salt and wished for the best. About a third of the way through the film that I had to give up, simply the film is a mixture of things happen for no apparent reason and everything is offline. I like the movies that make you think, but this film was just a bunch of ideas that were put together and were never connected to. <br /> <br /> I do not think David Lynch - esteemed as some think, is anywhere near this area other than some trippy photos. To say that it is forbidden to hide the fact that there is no conspiracy or clear story is just a way or a justification for why I wasted an hour and a half in the film. The acting was good, but that could not save the lack of a story. I agree with the only comment previously published ... "It looks like you're in someone else's head ... while they're taking drugs", in other words, there's nothing logical.
