I've written a lot about Purple Rain, a vital musical "quin-Essential", but I'm here to tell you that the film is not to be praised. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's get one prince in a row who is a great musician and music is the only area where Purple Rain is the best. So the result is impressive. If this movie is filmed entirely as a musical, it would be a great experience. Unfortunately, it is not, so the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, the terrible representation / writing, the character of the prince, "The Kid," is supposed to be a kind of illusory ambiguity that consists of a few words. Unfortunately, this is simply awkward and awkward. A good single person should have some of the chatter moments, and unfortunately a Prince person rarely has more than a few words of dialogue in the film and it is hard to believe that he will get the girl that way. Everything seems a bit far away here, it's a shame because you can say that this is a terribly conflicting figure and lives a very complicated life, but we are not allowed access to it. <br /> <br /> The surprising aspect of this film is how much of this happens in a concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to be in the back seat of the shows here, which I think are logical from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a two-hour film where half of it seems to be on stage, especially when personal stories are replayed. He was put aside. <br /> <br /> To summarize: this is not a very good film.
