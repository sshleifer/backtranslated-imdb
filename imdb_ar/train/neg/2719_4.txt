When a small planet of the space age drops absurd putty on the ground, it soon begins to consume earthlings and weight. The only part of this stale car that I enjoyed was all the wonderful classic cars. This dog had many holes that could be cut and sold to Swiss cheese. This thing actually made $ 20 million? McQueen's salary was 3K? All of them were wage-earners. The "monster" looked very much like the big canvas bag and the "teenagers" looked as if they could have children approaching a teenager. Those explosions of a gun; looked like a pellet gun with a condenser sound. The end was vulgar. Obviously the producers were leaving the door open to continue .... there was a lot. I was astonished.
