Raw, and sometimes, this was a summary of the latest work of Madhur Bhandarkar - page 3. He has no point of view - just shallow and ridiculous fossils in stereotypes. What is the film about? Is it about reporting a group of people (called 3 types) who are engaged in social networking and moving forward with their personal files in life - so they have no time for anything else. You are either in it or out of it. Is there no press at all to report daily incidents? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a major newspaper which is just an accessory; perhaps one of the artists to see who he is and who is what? Do not confuse the two. Then there is power play - this will happen in every walk of life. So what I finally told him - nothing - just a few rude jokes that were knit together in a less film.
