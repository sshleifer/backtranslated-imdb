Well ... I was waiting until it was shown on the video to see it, I wish I had, I actually caught a scary movie 2 on the cable the other day and made me crave for more of the same thing, what I got was AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean if you like Airplane or any of the other leslie nielsen vehicles, you may be in paradise, but if you used to use WAYANS comedy normally, it would be disappointing, there is so much candy in this that will keep the teenage youth hormone irritating the boys, It is probably why the box office hit the first week came out. I enjoyed the scary movie 2 times more then this feed, and one part 5 times. Strangely the best is 3 part 2, but again I always loved Halloween 2 better then original as well .. it might just be me. The most trivial part of the film must be the way foreigners say goodbye. But that was not worth $ 11 I spent to catch the mazes of this with my fianc√©. Save yourself money and grab the second part again on the cable until it is released on the video, then rent it, do not buy it.
