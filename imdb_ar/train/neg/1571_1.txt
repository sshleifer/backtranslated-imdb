Watching this movie made me think constantly; why do they make such a problem from some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow the car! In the film, the book was quick to think of a good reason for not stopping the car ... <br /> <br /> There are not a lot of good things to say about this film; all the usual cliches appear in their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is leaking like a sieve etc. This makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
