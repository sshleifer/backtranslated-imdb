What is the most horrific movie ever? Gynecological nightmare of "cries and whispers"? The acid psychological drama of Vaspender? The disturbing black comedy of "The Last House on the Left"? I'm sure that part of the film-loving audience that ties their masts to the good ship Buster Keaton, there's only one answer - one of his audio movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know what sparked my soul in this film - the basis of the complex and comprehensive material art of Keaton's music; the painful frequency of this major director of dialogue - not that he was not a beautiful voice or comedy, or that he could not To make the dialogue funny; it does not seem that the studio has given him enough time, so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers, making him only - ketone, not his character, look silly; or is it humiliating to see a ketone in a farce Noisy nationality, when he gave us some of the richest novels about romantic frustration in the film? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was more disturbing - having to watch Buster Keaton, the greatest comedy actor in the cinema, sitting aside to watch Jimmy Duranty doing a Chetik. It is these atrocities that make Yant Dantes compose yer Infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have a strange idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to the sound is to convert it to Marx Brother, complete with verbal warnings, the complex "clown", boring, clowning, theatrical setup, , And Telema Todd. Keaton was not a comedy of this kind, and where perhaps the lousy Groucho tongue and gentle humor would have been successful in this plot, the socially incompetent Professor Bustier could not study it and be predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to let an experiment like Lang in "M" or Rene Clair; he never tried to curb the tide like Chaplin. When a film like "The Year" hints at - tampering with the trains - the loss becomes clearer. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad thing in the middle of the flat direction - there's an excellent shake when you leave a camera on the Keaton bus on its own at a railway station; It is before. There is something almost granular about the way that slows down a ketone plot you need to have everything you can get. <br /> <br /> Here is a film about loneliness, emotional paralysis, order and mental effects of education, etc., and struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film is not to see the story of Professor TZ Post, but the abandoned genius Buster Keaton, trapped in the lousy prison, confused by the new technology, which ridiculed the fate of the malignant (in this case the studio), maintain stoical grace. Looked like this, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
