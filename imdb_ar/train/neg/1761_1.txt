First, I realize that a "1" is supposed to be assigned to the worst of the worst. This film gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it is not bad in the self-aware genre, which may allow it to get comic value or worship. He simply lacks his fingerprints on every number. ** contains possible spoilers ** dialog is completely deceptive. The continuity is very deliberate. Daniel has finished talking about his lost love, and in his last word the Flamenco dancers begin. A fake shock of her name (see I do not even remember the name of her character, let alone the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) tells her for the first time that her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. Flying vegetable carts went. Cars collide with each other. Motorcycles get off the stairs. People are almost beaten, but remarkably, no one. Oh, that's right ... Except for the person who was stabbed several times, it is obvious that he stumbles along the sidewalk with knife wounds, and it seems that a car approaching him did not notice his presence there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It's becoming clearer to me that movies like this can be produced. There is a lot of pressure in the film industry to make money, and I thought that someone in Hollywood was thinking about making good movies worth watching. Now there is a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not rent a DVD. Do not see it on the cable. There are lots of other things you can do that will make you feel more satisfied.
