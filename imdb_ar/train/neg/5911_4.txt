Potential spoilers <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is a highly exaggerated relay. International mystery man came directly from blue. He was the only star heard by a few people. But it was amazingly original, with a sense of humor and broad humor, always in good taste and enjoying a wonderful view. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercialized and cared for. <br /> <br /> Well, I will admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very fun, but after watching it only two or three times you see all the flaws. The acting was good, but Heather Graham could not act. Her performance was not very convincing and she was not close to a good level like Liz Hurley in the first band. Those characters that bloomed in the first, Scott Evil, No. 2, etc. are thrown in the background and do not hear many independent scenes. The movie was simply bypassed with the pattern. <br /> <br /> In particular, she hated the way she completely ignored some scenes in IMOM. When Vanessa was killed off at first, Basil sat down knowing he was along the way. What was the goal? They killed number 2 in the first one, and now they returned it without any explanation at all. This is supposed to be a parody, I do not think any of the characters carry a gun in the film. It is on a path, farther and farther from this point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are not very welcome. The entire Mini-Me game 'makes fun of meats - very old. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or redrafted by IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this is the first movie of the series, it is probably easier. But the series began with the intelligence of dry and then dropped to the level of humor. So I say, watch this movie only if you do not see his predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one disappointment.
