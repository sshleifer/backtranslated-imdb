We have reached the maximum of reasonableness with this film. Basically, dinosaurs come aboard this ship driven by some weird old fart called Neweyes (which you need after you've seen this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that children's desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times should be granted to all to see for shameful exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (very bad the scriptwriter did not have it). By the way, does it seem strange that among all the wishes of children in the world, Neweyes gives the desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not give the wishes of children to stop starvation? Illness? the war? I mean Come! Does not Newise have any better relationship with all the power he has ??? Finally, when the dinosaurs reach the modern age, they begin to sing, dance and destroy ruin (basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad LSD trip, I mean nowhere else you can see where the T-Rex game to play golf and jump on Spider-Man balloon? ). They end up in the circus and make Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) the children who have established a friendship with the dinosaurs signing a blank contract. why? Why children sign a blank contract ?? Squeyeyes says that if the dinosaurs take some ... "brain drain" it will allow the children to leave. Dinosaurs instead of ripping the evil limp Screweyes from the limb, surrender and agree to its terms. What?! That's stupid! He could have threatened him, made him give up the contract, then ate it and went out with the children. I think the directors were trying to show that violence is bad, a point of contention when dinosaurs escape and finally wrap a handful of squeyeyes and eat it quite apparently. Oh yeah, that's not violent at all! It's no sense, it's not fun, it's stupid, it's stupid, it's poorly written and it contains some of the biggest holes in the plot ever filmed. Even for a baby movie ... that's bad.
