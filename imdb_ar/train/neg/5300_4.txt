I'm one of the millions of Colombian addicts around the world, and I just watched this, the episode that started it all, on the British Channel Five. It is wonderful to think about what has emerged from this film, and I can not help but marvel at all of the enormous potential of Colombo and add all the small touches that make it a wonderful and classic series. However, this particular film is not as good as the rest (except the last embarrassing episode and the British episode sponsor). If Colombo is manufactured according to the original "pilot", it certainly will not last long, or be seen and loved around the world. In this film, Lt Columbo wears elegant clothes, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and happens to be very aggressive. There is also no chemistry of cat and mouse between Colombo and the "villain". Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Colombo started out.
