I saw this trailer and I told myself that my God is this real movie, who wants to see this movie and at the same time I thought my girlfriend turned to me and said, "We have to go see this film." He said..enough so I saw this go about 5 minutes and tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap fear but there was none of these. One of the worst films I have ever seen should be that the director has no impact on any perspective. The same footage was used again, and once again the thrill was not confirmed. The cast was told to fall out. I would love to see the text where the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying, giggling and bad music, and there was no evolution at all. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... Well, there was no conspiracy. I know we'll be a group of high school on a night concert with a serial killer stalker, that's awesome! Hmmm the acting was what you would expect in the hopeless Australian soap opera, that main character damned the Blondy god that bothered me. Its longest line must be half a sentence, and each time it was in the camera, it would only draw another rude expression of the face. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies, do not see this, if you have me and you do not have a good choice, I wish you good luck, maybe smuggling an iPod or magazine. I can not believe this movie got!
