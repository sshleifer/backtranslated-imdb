It is rare to feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is highly worthy due to its poor production and bias. <br /> <br /> I felt a unique attempt by some filmmakers to portray the Palestinian family as stupid and unreliable. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel from persecution, yet the film is filmed and arranged in such a way that we feel that the politically oppressed population is the Israeli Jewish population. We do not see any evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian youth. We hear only other Palestinians in prison. I understand that the restrictions exist, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of the film to feel that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely closed her mind because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued not wanting to see the hurt of the parents of the bomber, and her angry and closed words caused the last meeting to come out of control. It is realistic, in my opinion, to see the Israeli mentality as the root of the problem; the calls for understanding and freedom have been ignored, and the recognition of the process by which the Jewish population has taken over the land has been ignored. <br /> <br /> This two has been given because of the selfish weaknesses of the mother, which are usually admirable in a documentary film, but in light of the lack of neutrality, everything seems exploitative. Also for weak releases, lack of background in the actual example, and finally lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. In the end, it's a poor documentary and a poor film. I admit that this is a partial result of the political situation, but I am forced to notice flaws in the direction regardless of the sad subject and the heart.
