where do I start? Well, do not compare this film to fight with the club a ridiculous start. If this is the case with the fighting club, violence, blood, injustice, etc. will be more visible and realistic. Second, this film is not a football factory - it is much more realistic (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickleby seem awkward). Just enough, the story is quite decent and the fighting scenes are well designed - with a decent end I would add. But the film is generally poor and very bad. Since people have said that dialects should not spoil a film - I do not agree - either a simple mistake in casting, or a lack of effort in training the sounds that caused the film to rage all the way - it was clear from the scene that one of the Americans / . Do not get me wrong, a man with a good appearance, looks great in his head from the skin - but not a football hooligan. Can continue forever about how ridiculous the scene of football - the situation of "false host". Also, when the GSE plays United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - meaningless - this is a real organization of gangsters and thugs, which is filmed in the movie as Mickey Mouse worship of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - West Ham and Millwall have not played over the past two years in the tournament together? They are, ten years well. I am sure that Bother will be able to access the Milwall Bar. Basically, a very bad movie will be loved by people if they have little knowledge of real football and riot. If you really like football and you get the attention of a naughty criminal, you'll feel as though this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
