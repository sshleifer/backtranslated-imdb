First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> I will admit my first mistake: I did not realize that this was making a TV movie. You are "kicked out" by the "R" certificate. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes long. Trend and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The downside of the film is that it is definitely located in the "flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call for a "R" rating. No nude or unjustified sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Both Ona Grauer (who is very beautiful), Christina Copeland, Sonya Salome and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to move forward in their careers as they were all used as low-level supporting actors. Robert Patrick was wonderful. He usually made Mitch Pellegi think of a modern day for me Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I came to respect as an actress during the Millennium Series, has not been given a challenge to show her range. The biggest disappointment was with regard to cast Tracy Pollan. Apart from being less than average and not particularly attractive, her voice is very annoying. I found myself mute the television during her conversation. I recommend this movie to anyone with Lifetime TV. I would not recommend paying any money to watch this movie. Since I did not find anything that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is only seen on TV, because nothing will be cut off. As a television film I would like to rate this as 5 out of 10. As a feature film with an R certificate and like a strong crew, I will make it as a film out of ten.
