Since I started visiting this site, voting for movies, I did not give any film a single rating. So that the annoying "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got 2. There's a reason for that. <br /> <br /> At any time I find myself watching what I think is a really bad film. I have to stop and ask myself the question "Is this movie really bad like Theodore Rex?" I could never Answer "Yes". <br /> <br /> I would like to give something for some reason to know what the crackhead said, "Hey, let's make a Blade Runner with Barney as Harrison Ford!" She decided it was a good idea to spend time and money actually to make it a photograph. Moreover, I want to know what kind of market they were selling this if it was not disturbed to the video. This is a rare monster: a very violent film for children and an insanely stupid way for adults. I was asking, "What were they thinking?" But in this case, this may in fact be redundant. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you just have to expose yourself to this monster if you are one of the five or six paramedics from "Howard the Duck", or if you are interested in seeing more of the movie Evil Insane of all time, or you really want to punish yourself.
