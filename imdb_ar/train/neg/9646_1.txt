The lack of content in this film surprised me more. First, although people will compare this with Rock On! But I was really surprised to say that this was worse than Rock On! Awesome story Ajay Devgan Gaming cast with Salman Khan and Asen Giddy kidding with me. The music was okay Khanabad was the movie track and the rest was bad! Vipul Shah still does not learn from Singh is a comedy King's bashed critical. Now Asin .. Where did she come from Sorry for Asin fans there but sucking the big time in this movie which was acting so badly did not look good in every overdose of makeup! My final judgment is going to watch Aladdin with your family instead of wasting your time here.
