... or a quick digest audience .... <br /> <br /> So, you've got this doctor who is experimenting with stolen body parts for some mysterious reason. He wants to improve the transplant, but feels he needs to do so in his basement. WTF ??? Then suddenly, unfortunately, comfortable, her fiance cuts her head in a traffic accident he is responsible for. He suffers from grief, keeps her head in a lasagna pan (or is she a strudel?) And pumps her full of "adrenal gland" (such as the adrenal glands) to keep him alive. Then she wakes up, talking about her head (so to speak), although her neck has been clearly cut in the vocal cords, and she has no lungs so she can not speak even if she has been hit. It seems that b * tch does not thank everything her fiance did. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief turns to cornea because he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved's head on the body of a first pimbo that he can pick up from the street. At the same time, the assistant doctor, a kind of dime store Igor, enters into a philosophical controversy with the head, who has established a distant friendship with the "monster in the treasury" (every crazy world has one). In the end, the screenwriter realizes that he can not continue to hurt the hatred of women and fear the problems of intimacy with the endless audience, so he kills everyone, and then assumes that he goes to the bank to pay the check before the financial supporters have the opportunity to stop paying it . <br /> <br /> Did you mention that I think this is a bad film? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop viewing that edited version without the usual stuff. The sight of the helper in his arm has been broken. Walking around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is very valuable.
