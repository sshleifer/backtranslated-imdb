I have Final Justice Joe Joe Baker great that revolves around Texas, and shoots people who shoot people. Then he's out of Malta where he shoots more people. He locked up several times to shoot people. Then he went into a firefight with the bad man dressed as a monk. There is a chase for the boats, and Jo-don ends up in prison again. Finally, Joe Dunn, assisted by Ellen from Seinfeld, killed the bad man, blew up a boat or two and shot someone by setting the fire on fire. All this and an attractive theme song, just like Mitchell!
