As a writer, I find very bad films, making it a complete slap in her face. Talk about insulting. I was writing better stories in eighth grade. Bad behavior, bad writing, poor guidance, and when all are added, the result is complete and a complete failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this film can achieve is deceiving the consumer in relaxing their time. Would the green light be something badly written? It is not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, impressive, mysterious, frightening, not exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring without any twist. The plot is recycled like an aluminum box. They have somehow managed to cast some very familiar actors, who must all be very desperate to work or in the hope that one of these independent films with a low budget is the "core of imagination." This script should have been used to link bird cage, not film. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, a woman has an area of ​​5'2 pounds 105 pounds of course the power to kill men and women twice their size without conflict and in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if it will trap you sexually transmitted diseases.
