There is not enough here. There are some ridiculous sites, but not enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I was expecting this to be a hidden gem. has not been. He was a hidden person. <br /> <br /> All the time I was watching, I was thinking, "Geez, I could do more than that and I'm a fool." Incredible few good reviews. I sucked in before them. At no time did I laugh out loud. Maybe this was funny or sophisticated in 1987, but the man, fell today. This film was a promise, and did not meet him. Perhaps if they rewrite it several times. I can not fault the actors. They were not the best, but they did not have much to do. This movie failed because the threadbare was written. Very disappointed.
