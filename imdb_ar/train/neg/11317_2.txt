This step is as bad as it comes. I was, however forced to give it 2 to the scene. There are many wonderful shots in the southwest, including plenty in the Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the United States. It is also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed movies. In fact, one scene was filmed with Chris and the girl in a place called John Ford Point.
