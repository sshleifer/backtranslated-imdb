Spoilers: I am always surprised by the number of people who have made this game ratings good. It was awful. The script and audio acting alone ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the two most unwanted characters in the game. You almost pray for their death. Worse still, the number of vampires in this game is less than the presence of wolves in The Beast Inside. If you're expecting some kind of vampire-style story from Anne Rice, her femininity. The story of this game has very little to do with the vampires. You will not see anything until the end, and even then, you will not be able to fight them. <br /> <br /> The story has radical and largely blasphemous views of Christianity. I was surprised that he came down from the drawing board. I am not a Christian and I find her abusive. Mostly, the story revolves around the search for the Holy Grail and the buried treasure. The abduction of a royal child, who should have been the focus of attention, is being pushed aside. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the child. In fact, almost no one asked about the child after the first few periods. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very bad. The characters move quickly even in the best of systems. It is chunky and obsolete. It is difficult to move from FMV from The Beast Inside to the awesome game engine of Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also takes a big turn. I do not really know why she was so wild, but they slept together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game to tell his best friend Mosley how he thinks of Grace as a sister and does not think she is for him. They seem to have already been brought together to sleep together. But it is undesirable throughout the game, so that hardly even cares at this stage. His dialogue was the worst in the game. He was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos in anything female the whole game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what seems to be the speech of Dear John. I think I was fed up with it as most players were. <br /> <br /> I found the story disturbing and boring. I was expecting to play the story of a royal child kidnapped by vampires. I was expecting to see and fight the vampires, and maybe even Gabriel or Grace would turn into one. but not. Instead, the story focused on seeing the distorted author of Christianity. what a shame. Here they had fantastic adventure elements, and instead we got this. <br /> <br /> To me, the only interesting parts of the game were in the end. We get some style puzzles working in the end. But it was not worth suffering through the entire game to reach them. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this game. I restored it when I came out years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I stopped it for years. I just dust it off recently to find out what you're missing. Now, I'm very sorry because I did. My favorite characters were destroyed. I hope there will be only a fourth game to recover the series. I hope they get it next time. It would be a shame to end the series with this installment.
