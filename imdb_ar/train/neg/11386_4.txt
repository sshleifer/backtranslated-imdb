One of those documentaries thank God does not live there. This person tells two fighting factions in Colombia, the guerrillas, the paramilitaries and the surrounding Medellin peoples. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death are spreading. Men, who are under the age of 22, not in the middle of the war, are in prison. the girls ?? Not women and girls? Always react in the same way when someone is crying and screaming. You scratch your head. What were they expecting, really? I do not know what is more disturbing: night shootings and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to accept things as negatively as they are. Or seeing this boy drinking what is obviously not the first beer, being all, 10? If you want to get any of these young people out of their situation and put them somewhere where they have the opportunity to do more, more, how much will they choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
