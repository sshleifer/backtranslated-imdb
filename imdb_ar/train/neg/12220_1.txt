This film is actually worse than most of the films I have suffered, and I have suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense. It has got a terrible and exhausting dialogue; developments are a futile conspiracy. I have really drawn scenes of "nervous images", which look like a therapeutic art project in high school rather than a horror film; 5/10 at best attractive women; long boring sexual scenes include women who said, "Forget what you know about virgins! They have already used Killer Klowns masks from Outer Space during the scene of masturbation, which should be a saving grace because this film was very funny, but it is not. Vidin Viel is the worst man in history. <br /> <br /> Give this person a miss at all.
