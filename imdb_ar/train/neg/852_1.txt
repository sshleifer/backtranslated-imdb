I will keep this brief. This "adaptation" to the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many fans of Kubrick and Nickolson at this site, and as a result, this film was mysteriously found at the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is laughable like Torrance as well as Shelley Duval. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters Jack and Wendy Torrance are full jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: Adhere to the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, people who say that Kubrick had every right to destroy the story King Because King is ... A good writer should not commit to reviewing "masterpieces" like "closed wide eyes".
