As if the film's story was not depressed enough, this film shows that cows are slaughtered graphically in a slaughterhouse for five minutes while the novel narrates its early life as a machete. Weird things. Then there is the basic premise of the hero / hero who goes and cuts his cock because one of the ten warriors at work says he would go with him if he was a girl. Is this person myself, Mazuchi, just a queen sentenced to things too far? What kind of painful childhood does he have? Just because he was not adopted, he had to live with the nuns who first loved him and then hated him later because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us the reasons why he did what he did, but it is really difficult to empathize with him. Such self-destruction is sad and unusual. Was it supposed to be funny? What was everything really?
