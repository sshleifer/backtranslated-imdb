Words can not begin to describe the magnificence of this film. I hope it is "very bad, it's good", but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless, and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Freijon was not the highlight of the film. The only person who does not have an attractive character is director Brett Kelly, who considered himself a true memory of vanity. Both look like relatives, relatives and sisters. <br /> <br /> Gal, Cherie Thurige, is a spectator. The full opposite of Anne Marie - attractive. This girl is long and wilu and can work. Although you can tell them they are blocking you. <br /> <br /> It seems that all the representatives are reluctant to work, especially the supporting man, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why does Kelly prevent his representatives from acting? Is it really that bad director? Everyone has summed up the entire story - no one. Kid and Kelly are being taken steps in the stools to solve the crime. I know how he felt as he intervened in the feces, that's what I felt after seeing his film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to restore my money from the rental shop. It's a home movie that is best left to watch the director's friends (and if you look for him, you'll see these same friends who gave the film positive marks).
