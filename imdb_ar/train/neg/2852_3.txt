This is a very unpleasant film, if it is made in an obscene way. I tried it because it starred Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, both good actors, and because the conspiracy line - the mob leader about to be released from a mental institution - seemed promising. The film is described as a comedy, somewhat. What we have is a series of endless shots - you must pardon people who are light and elegant, if they are somewhat surreal, and shoot at each other - in the head, stomach, knee, foot and heart it seems that the anatomy is avoided, while speaking the dialogue Mysterious and hidden, and some are supposed to be humorous in a postmodern way. The Goldblum dialogue for the entire film on the 3x5 card, wearing a single facial expression - a sarcastic smile - can be adjusted all the time. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Heinz are doing their best. Bert Reynolds does a veil. Credits list Rob Rainer and Joy Bishop, but I missed them one way or another (a good step on their side). Everything is cold, sterile, mechanical and not tasty. Heir, I think, to the "core of fiction," "Fargo" and "natural birth killers". If you like them, you might like this.
