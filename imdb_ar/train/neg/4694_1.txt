You are interested in titled Big Rig as you attend the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, you are eager to get out of the seats once you have finished the big digger. Big Rig is made up of many "big-wheelers" drivers who have started to deliver paid goods throughout the United States. The characters are all wonderful, but filmmakers have never deepened their complexity as people. Instead, the story slips as far as the maps in the film aim to guide, but they never do. At most, we miss. We - the public - will not go anywhere, and like the story story, we end up somewhere but without direction, location or conspiracy. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The dirty storytelling and board members' intention to "humanize" a group of people they consider "idiots" and "invisible" through unconscious resignation and anger. The problem here lies in the perspective of managers rather than truck drivers. Directors present their naive assumptions about truck drivers forward and simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. In general, the story lacks any tension, and the film is too long (must be a 15 minute fee), the big question is "So what" has never been answered, and the entire film is a comprehensive propaganda nothing to increase Enlightenment Directors) The outside world around the big excavators.
