What a wonderful idea for a movie: Put it around a movie maker with a block writer deciding to take tango lessons. Hey and what is the best idea that gave the pivotal role of a film director who cares about tango. Oh God, I wish I had a genius talent. Yes, I am cynical. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this kind of scratch is likely to produce money movies made. Come on unless you are a fan of crazy tango (I admit it already exists based on comments) or if you are a tough member of the Sally Potter fan club (?) There is nothing in this movie that would push you to the cinema to see it. Even if you are in the tango, much of the film is filmed with meaningless scenes like a restored house or a man on a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> The review lesson is soon to come, with a failed Scottish screenwriter sitting in front of the computer Who writes reviews very sarcastic but very entertaining of the films he saw. Gasp is in a state of shock when Theo Robertson put the shoe in the latest Hollywood movies, crying in sympathy for receiving another rejection letter from a film company, falling in lust as he bathed and rubbed soap on his body. The review lesson is coming close to the cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to finance the film <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter has nothing to do with Harry Potter
