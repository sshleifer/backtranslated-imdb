I watched about 30 minutes in this film before finally getting sick from this film. Sound, the so-called "plot", and each actor. It seems as if they all think they are the main part of the movie and shout "Notice me!" Repeatedly. A bad man owns his bad music, and says evil things like bad guys, just in case you have not picked them up. A good man does only courageous and noble things if you do not know that he is the good man. Lord, the sight of the plane. "My bone is missing! My God! It's impossible to reach his body or go to the toilet or anything else, it must be missing!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but frankly, I woke up and started to panic before she had time to look at the damn seat he was in.) <br /> <br /> As a religious girl, I want to apologize For the world to waste it for the film that was printed on it. <br /> <br /> I want to be back 30 minutes.
