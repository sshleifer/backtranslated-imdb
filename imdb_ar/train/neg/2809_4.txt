When I look at my university days at Ohio University, there will always be one event I will remember with great memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel OU and until the last few years, played pretty much anything was sent. This included many DIY films ranging from a man who scaled the marshmallows Peeps and then scanned pictures from them online, to a Macbeth version of the eighth-graders who seemed to learn how to make sticks. <br /> <br /> However, the King, in my opinion, from Channel 23 was the Midnight Slider lineup. It was the first time I saw it around 2am. I should have studied. Or sleep. Or watch regular TV. But no, all this is for pussies. I and my roommate watched the Midnight Skater, and when it was completed, I did not think any of us thought that none of the film had just happened. But it was certainly a few nights later, and we had to understand that this film was actually present. <br /> <br /> I could have gone on about it, but how awful it was, but the kind of awful thing that makes life worth living. The conspiracy is disjointed, terrible acting, everything is scarred by the soul, but by God, if there are others who see you with you, it is impossible not to spend a good time watching it. Of its kind like the first time you hear "Courage" by Chuck Pahalnyuk. You hear her, you feel disgusted and shaken, but after five minutes, all you want and want is to make someone else experience the terrible horror you just had. <br /> <br /> A short story, Midnight Skater, for all epic imperfections, makes for some very late night fun. In addition, I strongly want to be a Midnight Skater subject. Glory to those who wrote and sang the sweet of God I love that song.
