A very bad film that offers nothing new. The usual screams and complaints try to make up a confused but thin story. Representation is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Nisson signed on is this guess anyone. Owen Wilson becomes one of the worst performances in the history of modern horror films. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a fun looking at her and not the other though Lily Taylor did a job above average. The special effects were somewhat memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and gorgeous. However, they can not make up the bad representation and the story that seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Do not care.
