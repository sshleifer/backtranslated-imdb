Within 15 minutes, my entire family was spying on the character of Goldy Mort to die, or at least for the character of Steve Martin to leave. In 40 minutes, we turned it off. There are only a few films a year that we experience so troublesome that we can not even endure them for a long time until the story is established. <br /> <br /> Normally I love both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and I remember enjoying the original Neil Simon. So I blame Mark Lawrence and Sam Wiseman. Bring together the director of "What's the Worst that Could Happen" and the author of "Miss Creation 2", and I think that's what it ended.
