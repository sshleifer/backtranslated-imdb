This DVD appears to be targeting someone who will turn it on and turn it on in an infinite background loop. It is organized as a series of music videos in the Grand Canyon for various Tangerine Dream music selections. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD music is dim, and the transfer to the DVD seems dull and dim. Very expensive DVD for what it is.
