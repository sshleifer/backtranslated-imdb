Stop. In the Twin Cities, we have a station showing "Big Bad Movie" Monday to Friday. "Night Knight" was a movie with Carrie Fisher titled "It's Again" about a really annoying woman who ends up being killed when thugs break into her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to chase her husband. She wants him to seek revenge for her killers, and then "she's back." It will not allow him to rest until he does so. She infuriates him indefinitely ... and viewers too! This movie is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, I love the bad movies, although (Faii is Xanadu). I was really shaking my head throughout the film, and I wonder who thought this would be a good idea for a movie. Pia is just too annoying. The plot is ridiculous. The representation is bad; the story ... well, you get drifting. Anyway, if you want to watch a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check out this movie. You will not be disappointed. Hey.
