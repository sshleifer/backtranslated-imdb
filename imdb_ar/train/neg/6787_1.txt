I am sorry to report that I have seen this movie several times. When bombed at the box office, I repeated the night for almost a month on HBO. I have watched it over and over again because the TV in general is very bad - or it was at that time. I can not see anymore, so it may be wonderful now - as Samuel L. Jackson says about the pigs. "It may taste like sweet potato pie, but I will never know because I will not eat the dirty whale." To see. Dodley plays Arthur in the desert, always a few steps from Moses. I have gone straight after Brian's life, so you can guess this inspiration. The slightly funny bits move slightly for a long time until you close your eyes and scatter your teeth. There is one scene in which Arthur and Dum Duis meet in the desert, where they both drag and die of thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances who do not know each other well, and prepare with lunch. It could have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most vividly is a meeting with Pharaoh, in which Pharaoh is a black child on the street, which was completely prepared in King Tut. He must have read the lines straight because in the pre-release stage, they exaggerated the Hollywood equivalent of the black street language expressed by Kid Dyno-wannabe. Or maybe Jimmy Walker - who knows? who cares. They were able to turn a boring scene mainly into very racist, very superstitious, very long stools, one of those legendary things that will not leak, no matter how many times you try, so leave it there for someone else to deal with. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my assessment. If you rent this movie (do not buy it, wherever you do!), Prepare for yourself with a bottle of tequila and six packs of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they have reshaped the Poseiden Adventure game, one may be on top of the list to reshape. Maybe they'll hire a comedian this time.
