Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are two of the most impressive improvements, Airport '77 is not much better than Airport 1975: the dumping of dark commercial litter (this time literally) in a good way. Jack Lemmon is a pilot-packed plane being hijacked by professional thieves and crashed into the sea (all propaganda claimed to have been near the Bermuda Triangle, but not mentioned in the same film). When the rescue ships come to get the plane out of the water, we see all its cranes fall (somewhat blind) in the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagine the cranes blocking the plane, the passengers and the water-covered writing). NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be a "cut-out", with at least an hour of additional footage - mostly memories of past memories - pumped into the proceedings with precision from the episode "Gilligan's Island." The most exciting moments are the crash, and some players enjoy a bit of fun: Lee Grant is awfully drunk, and Linda Vakaro is a meaningless hostess, and Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are in the middle. However, personal conflicts and blatant military details are ultimately torn by the patient's patience. ** from ****
