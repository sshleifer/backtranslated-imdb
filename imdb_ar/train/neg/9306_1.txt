This movie is the worst excuse for mobile images I have ever seen. First of all, I would like to say that the front cover of this film is completely misleading, if you think you're about to see a really scary horror movie with a monster clown, you're so wrong. In fact, the killers' face does not look a bit like the front cover, it's just a picture they should find on Google and think they look fantastic. When talking about the things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some members of the gang are looking for a friend in the old forest, and suddenly the screen moves to a scene where there is a deer or a shepherd that is small. In the luster of sunshine ... I mean seriously WTF ?? How does this relate to the dark forests that roam? I bought this movie from a man in a market hoping to be amused, if it was not horror, at least it would be funny? Error! The next day, my colleague at work gave me rid myself of the plague named S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Do not see this movie !!!
