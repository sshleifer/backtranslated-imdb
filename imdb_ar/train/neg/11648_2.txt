As if there were not enough of those who were floating at that time already, we have here another lame Godfather's clone of the director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) that I had seen earlier this year. The name of the tight-fisted value at this time is Tally Savalas, who enters the procedure late and is seen for the first time from behind, leaning freely to his flowers and wearing a French painter's hat! Apart from not looking at Sicilian minimum, he does not enjoy a dialect of any kind other than his familiarity. Antonio Sabato, then, makes improbable gangs - apart from being a leading resistance leader; his relationship with Savalas, who became a paternal eye, is also unconvincing (especially after he later engaged in a relationship with the energetic niece of the teenager)! Besides, for the gang dust, there are few valuable actions to talk about and none of them is forgotten (although the final end of the clinic is well handled); moreover, the result scored by Francesco de Massi For service but nothing else. By the way, the DVD starts for the deals you half-leased through the credits so that no member of the acting team - or even the title of the movie - is ever listed!
