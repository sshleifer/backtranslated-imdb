Ram Gopal Verma has proven to be an innovative and efficient manager. He re-made the godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded greatly. Ditto for Lolita who made it as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay was the film he says repeatedly inspired him most. Unfortunately, I've succeeded in making a disappointing and ultimately dull edition. <br /> <br /> The representation ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan appropriately threatening the role of the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were awful and forgotten. Mehbooba Mehbooba appeared as a second-rate music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the rhythm and dialogues that could have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in the theater, I found myself waiting for the break, and then for the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving the entire length of the film. In the end, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
