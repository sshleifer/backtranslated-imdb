With all the excessive violence in this movie, NC-17 can be. But it was possible to be a PG-13 jerk and there was a lot of division when the mother had an original boy friend with bad hair. There was a great evolution of the characters making the film better than watching it, and then after the child came back to life as a scarecrow, there was a reckless hour and ten minutes in which people killed. The violence was too extreme and I think the death toll was more than a dozen, a large number of such films. Almost every character is stabbed in the film or cut off her head, but the teacher who calls it "the white trash" and "the leader" (although the character character is only a hood and does not approach it, I know the hoods and I'm part. , Do not paint in the classroom, sitting there and throwing things at the teacher). The teacher deserved to die more horribly than anyone else, but was stabbed in the back. There were two exciting scenes in the film, but it did not last long enough to be scary at all. As I said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the story line got their heads. If the bit is really fun, it will be nc-17. Two children describe a body they find in maize fields and describe it as much calmer than it actually was. They explained to the policeman that there were birds crawling in the men's intestines. His stomach was not open until there was no way in his stomach, although I wanted to see it. The acting was pathetic, the characters were lost, and the Scarecrow could do a lot of sports. I suggest renting this film to death scenes, and I will not see it again any time soon, but I enjoyed excessive violence. Also, do not bother with the sequel, I watched five minutes from him and was bored to death, looks good but not. The original Scarecrow kept me really interested.
