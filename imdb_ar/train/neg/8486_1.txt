I can not believe anyone who thinks there is anything original or interesting about this movie. I'm a science fiction fan like the next guy, and I can even enjoy old movies with ridiculous sites when written by someone other than the monkey. (See, for example, My Glowing Assessment of Altered States [1980]). <br /> <br /> A monkey could have better explained why I should take the basic idea behind this film for the second time. The problem is not that the producers have a low budget - they did not care. <br /> <br /> Now, to humiliate the magazines that are publicly worthless and show their glowing reviews on the box: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> < However, their film has passed the credibility review, but I know if I'm making a camera with a portable camera, a cheese plot and stupid effects, I'll show it to those journalists. I remind them of what they said about pregnancy conception.)
