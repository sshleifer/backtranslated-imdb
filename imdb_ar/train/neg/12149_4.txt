The "Feed the Crowds" group in Providence, Rhode Island, is trying to be cynical about the role of the media in the government. At best, it can be applied to the way the United States tries to control the media during the Iraq war, but it ends up feeling hungry. There is no real tension in the story and very good representation. Worse still, the direction of the film is terrible, focusing more on the alien camera angles that fail to move anything beyond. "Is not this a strange way to carry the camera?" The special effects are very bad ... At one point a video is shown about the explosion on the city, which is laughable at best. <br /> <br /> The film contains two bright spots ... ads for post-zombie services (including reclaiming and partying). But it is very difficult to make the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but there is a lot of intelligence, humor and talent behind it.
