While some may argue that by showing other works of Bilal, one would appreciate this film better, but it fails in one major way. It does not stand on its own. The plot is a mishmash that confuses symbolism and substance. Here's an idea that begins with a specific story. Then the symbolic craft around it. We begin with two different narratives, this female who turned something into a human being, a "god" judged for some reason, but getting the last flight on earth, and John's mysterious character that seems to develop somewhat "beyond the city limits. The answer to any of these questions is, but do we care, no, there is no evolution, we want to empathize with any character in the story, and the closest we get to a generation and even after that development is intermittent at best. It is visually impressive (as it is), but at the expense of the evolution of motivation, I like to see this rewritten by someone who can distance himself from The article is a bit and I should not feel that every picture should be in the picture.
