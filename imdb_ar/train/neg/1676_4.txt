Val Kilmer, a strong performer. Dylan McDermott, strong performance. Josh Lucas, strong performance. Three very attractive actors deliver decent performance. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Notorious because of his good donations, a drug addict, and a man who continued to produce adult films, although he had AIDS, but did not make an interesting figure. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events that preceded and followed a vicious mass murder in the late 1980s in Los Angeles where Holmes was associated, arrested and charged with murder, and ultimately acquitted. Just as in the case of OJ, the factor of guilt, regardless of the result, ranged very high in the "I did it" area. <br /> <br /> No one sympathizes with him in this film, since everyone is a self-serving criminal. There is nothing remotely interesting here.
