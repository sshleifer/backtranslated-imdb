Jay Ritchie's noble efforts were overcome, destroyed, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spit, punched, sodomized, abused, and left to die for Madonna's appalling performance. Her representation reminded us of a graduate of the Al Gore School of Drama and Public Speaking. Jay Ritchie made a fairly noble attempt to reshape this, and if all the scenes in which his wife was excluded are a fair film at best. I think the best job ever was, Jay had to please his wife that her performance was good enough not to re-shoot. If you have a chance to watch Swept Away or cut your fingernails for 89 minutes ... go to Foot Care.
