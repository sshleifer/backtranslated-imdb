This was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the whole movie! The plot was very cheesy. Especially the end. This movie turns from the disaster of the end of the world to saving snakes! I mean, come on! I swear ... I think they use SUP PUPPETS for snakes! There was this terrible tribal scene in the middle with two main characters that happened to be absolute. How predictable! It was terrible that my mom and sister could not finish it, and when we finished it, it was almost a year later! The second time we saw and completed this time, we made similar MST3K comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: See this only if you are a movie basher! Make fun comments, watch this as he sleeps to laugh, I mean huge laugh. Watch also ridiculous. The metaphor that explains this film: This film is a very shallow field filled with cheese and sock dolls!
