You have just registered in IMDb to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished sitting in this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the ability not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a few motion pictures and whatnot, but Princess Blade has some of the worst battles I've seen in a movie. Most sword fighting involves moving the swords backwards and fourth in the hope that the opponent is not doing the same. I've seen a lot of student films with better movement and stronger plots. <br /> <br /> So, now we have a motionless "futuristic" motion film, and there is no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> So most of the movie has no action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and farmer / terrorist and his troubled sister. The film contains multiple plot lines, none of which is really worth it all. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was part of the problem that I saw describing, which is very bad. The actors were completely overwhelmed with all their lines, so it was hard to follow what was going on. But I got the general idea. (Knowing what was said would not exactly save the movie in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard about this future action / Ninja flick, then I've heard a mistake. That's what I thought when I heard it, now I lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this get you. Clear direction of it.
