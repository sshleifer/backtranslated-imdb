I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (actors delivering most of their lines directly to the camera) to camera shots (all mid- or mid-range shots ... footage and very small background footage were not very terrible). I have seen this during my spring holidays and it is very safe to say that I feel like I'm out of 114 minutes of my vacation. No stretch of imagination is recommended.
