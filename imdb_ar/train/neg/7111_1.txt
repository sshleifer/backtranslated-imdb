- A recent couple move to the house of the wife of the deceased husband. It was not long before the new wife began to feel that someone did not want her at home. You see skulls around the house. But when the husband achieves, he finds nothing. Is someone trying to bring her back to her recent asylum? Or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I've seen the scream of a skull without the help of the MST3K crew. It will probably be the last time I see it that way. Can you say boring? I'm not talking boring ordinary - I'm talking watching the grass grow dull. There are great extensions of the film where nothing happens. The screen can be empty and has got a lot of entertainment from them. Unmanned characters and the most monotonous conversations imaginable. Skull screams may be marketed as an adjunct to sleep. <br /> <br /> Actors do not help much. Most of them offer lines with a conviction usually dedicated to playing school-grade. I did not look at it, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this film appeared in anything of cinematic value. I will not go into the script given to work with actors. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most stupid lines ever spoken in the film. <br /> <br /> - You've been warned! Either avoid this one at any cost or, at least, look for the version of MST3K.
