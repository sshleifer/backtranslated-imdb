We had to doubt the discovery that with only two minutes to turn off the lights, we were the only ones there. Five others joined just before the film began. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to retrieve this movie. The representation is appalling (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is normal. The effects we have seen a million times. The direction of the film is the worst we've ever seen. Leaky and disjointed. No one laughed including the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It was too early if my wife did not give up a hot dog !!! If there was nothing else to watch in the cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn, hot dogs and see some people. You'll have more fun time !!! <br /> <br />
