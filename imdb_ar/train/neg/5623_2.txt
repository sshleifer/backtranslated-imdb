Hollywood's attempt to transform the life of Jack London into the film "Jack London" for adventure is not a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, concludes flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some letters to Londonisk; it is nice to see Jack the bearded receives a "wild appeal" after spending some good time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog "Buck". Virginia May and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film paints an unfortunate yellow "conspiracy" between the lives of London and World War II, both tense and humiliating. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
