This is probably the biggest, ugliest, and biggest public steam show I have ever seen in children's programs that have already become successful. The main character, Johnny, while I understand that he is supposed to represent a normal child, is not beloved or even acceptable. Lame, exaggerated jokes (for example, "Come on, I have not seen that next gulp." Come on, it was not funny at first, it's not nice) and lacks any form of primitive intelligence or inspiration. Finally ... it is just ugly to consider. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. I can not stand to watch the show, because somehow, art style is just ... gross. Horrendous, in fact. Just plain trivial. <br /> <br /> I can not assume that this gets a lot of broadcast. Although I understand that nostalgia can be a bit illogical and I should not hope my hopes come back again ... I really miss the old fees. The Dexter Lab, The Powerpuff Girls ... prepared anything other than this nonsense. I think it's just wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> Simply, I advise you not to waste your time in this show. I think the really good cartoons can be enjoyed by older children as well. This is not interrupted.
