This movie is a very bad attempt to make money using a classic feature. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to portray myself. Very poor and influential, special effects are heinous, and the plot is zero. To summarize: Superman leaves the earth, because scientists have discovered parts of his original constellation, some of them in space (Doh), and tell his girlfriend nothing before he leaves (Doh again), taking off in a spaceship (again I think five years later, I look forward to communicating with his girlfriend again (who is now destroying his son, a son, in my humble opinion at the age of at least 7 years.) What about Lex Luther trying to grow a new continent for the sale of land? > <br /> I will vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else about your time, do not go to watch this movie and even if not Do not have anything else, stay home and watch TV!
