There are so many incorrect phrases in this documentary so much so that I found myself screaming on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Seabrel may be able to produce a delightful DVD, but unfortunately he lacks the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> It depends on either inaccuracy, incomplete narrative, old favorite hints of "the government always lies to us", people who believe what they are told, and inaccuracies or details behind the claims. <br /> <br /> Moreover, his "exclusive" or "unpublished" footage is available free of charge online from various sites. <br /> <br /> Further reading of the circumstances surrounding the production of this production shows that it used false claims for interviews and used creative editing of the responses to promote its own views. <br /> <br /> All claims submitted by Mr. Sibrel about "errors", "errors", or "reporting irregularities" in the Apollo program were comprehensive. <br /> <br /> How can I recover those strange 40 minutes of my life?
