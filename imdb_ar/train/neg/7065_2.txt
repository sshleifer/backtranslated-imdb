Well, I found this movie in my old dad's pile of movies and it looked good from the cover but the film was already sucked !! Well, the first story with the swimmer was very good but it took some time to enter, then the story was delayed with the boy completely! It was not so scary! His dream seems like a little baby sleeping story. Then one girls' news was completely retarded too. I'm sure someone will call the newsman and ask him to come out with you. But this ended quietly as he was stabbed and was in the hospital and saw him on television and told her all that was unwanted. Then that was a pretty gay story about the guy who brought the dead back .. Even so, I'm so stupid that I would not say anything about it. Another one was the best. It was not scary, but the idea of ​​the story was so wonderful ... Yes, the girl got killed as she killed all her classmates or something. Then, when the dreams of each other are finished, the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). End.
