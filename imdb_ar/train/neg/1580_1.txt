It became a film to worship Chinese university students, although I did not watch it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK. <br /> <br /> They are full of artful manifestations, and the plot is modest and unreal. The "spirit" you want to convey is how independent artists resist the practice of the music industry, maintain "purity of the artistic spirit" and not "sell themselves for dirty money." This is really dizziness and superficial. The diologue is essentially pathetic. Poor representation. sceenplay is full of art claim. It's a fantastic movie for kids and that's it. <br /> <br />
