Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV "The Week of the Week" in the early 1970s, and I loved the scary films that routinely appeared, including the Crohoven Farm, the Bad Ronald, the Devil's School for Girls, The Night Stalker, etc., but this one is just stupid ... It is clear that this writer is trying to take advantage of the horrific murders committed by Manson a few years ago, stars Denise Weaver starring the movie "McCloud" and "duel" as a father takes camp The family encounters some hippies who decide for some reason to terrorize them For the sake of God, call the police, hit Hell or anything, just do not sit there and grumble about it .Lame representation is pretty much, the story is incredible, etc. Susan Dae looks nice in bikini but Ignore this if it is broadcast on the TV.
