Watching Tom Hanks as a musician with the Irish mob is very much like seeing Jimmy Stewart as an armed rapist who does not work. I had a very difficult time accepting this. I do not think Tom can not act. Can I continue my career since mazes and monsters, but for some reason this happened to me? Perhaps because I admire watching the picture novels and risk being asleep like a cheerleader (the only form of life less than a cheerleader fan is a cockroach). The whole movie failed for me. Additions to Jude, and leaving everything else leaves me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a big crime film in the context of Bonnie and Clyde Mendez took the whole story out and left only bare bones. There are things you should like about this click, but the cinema breathes in full with the beautiful pictures Paul Newman is excellent as usual and I really enjoy the result, but Tom "the Angel of Death" Sullivan was quite flat.
