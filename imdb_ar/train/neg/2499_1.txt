The film's collection includes some of the best New Zealand actors I have ever seen in wonderful roles, but this film fills me with a great disgrace just to be from the same country where they were. Fake American accents are the first evidence that things are about to go wrong. Another clever review also noted that the luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, decorated with a few multicolored flags stolen from the used car park. Most of the actors appear to belong to New Zealand's long-standing Shortland Street soap. It looks as though this film was dreaming of a birthday party in Shortland Street, the result of a lot of jinn, maybe a bit of Salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" meeting with The Love Boat, organized by your local elementary school run by an autistic person and getting the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are a representative, I advise you to watch this movie, as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
