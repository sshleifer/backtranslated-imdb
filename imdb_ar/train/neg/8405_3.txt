Before watching this film, I was expecting a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; instead, it was a book that was boycotted by dramatic scenes illustrating various "diseases". It did not bother me much, but it hampered the enjoyment of the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed with the film was better, in my opinion. If you are building a film on the text of psychology, you should find a more interesting (and preferably precise) text than this text. The film pulls through parts that are no more than a 19th-century sexual psychology video encyclopedia and will be quite unlikely if they are not sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are many stories with the evolution of the actual personality that attracts us. <br /> <br /> But, in a disappointing way, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality have not been challenged, for the most part. I used to hope that the stories would be used to show how the flaws of his old view of psychology are still retained by many to this day. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few of the idols and orientations, with some fairly interesting stories showing trials and tribulations of some "sexual anomalies" before being treated. For most of the movie, the movie moves quickly to crawl (and mood) to appear. As a low-budget film, cinema and acting are not in the first place. Although I was * happy * with music, fashion and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the subject of this film was in my crooks, and I still feel like it is a less than average film. It is worth 3/10; 4/10 if you feel great generosity. I can not imagine anyone enjoying this if they do not already have an interest in sexual excitement.
