In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. Below I will explain and tell you why, in my humble opinion, this film spoils. <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes do their jobs, and while not one of their best, it's fine. The rest of the cast is doing a really bad job. Your mind, this is not the fault of the actors fully. The problem is that Jerry and Dennes are the only two units that have characters to even the slightest space in the film to give any depth. All other characters have a very small space in the movie to create any depth, or that character cliches so that no matter how difficult the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a somewhat complicated Se7en, but considering the direction only, I think he is doing a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is a bad program type in two ways. First of all, it's a bad script. The characters are shallow (except the characters of Gere's and Danes), and the wicked cliches and behaviors of characters are not at all reasonable. In addition, the book must have an agenda in which to restore our views and ethics to a hundred years. It is the kind of film that says that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price paid to them by society. It is also the kind of film that says, albeit only in line, that every form of sexual deviation must be punished without trial, a judge or a jury. And of course, according to the film, everything does not represent sex in the missionary office of the couple is a sexual misrepresentation. <br /> <br /> So, if you go to a film school and need an example of a bad script, or if you write texts yourself and want to increase the ego. Look. For everyone else, I recommend another film.
