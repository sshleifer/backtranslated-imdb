Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst films of all exaggeration. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers making films related to the period and giving a film of garbage. The songs were boring and not the kind of song you wanted to hear in your full-size car. Sunny Deol is famous for making trivial films, surpassing 100 villains on his own. He even kicked the metal prison door (Indian) and kicked a moving car away (Tysri Ankh). I can give 50 another example of the disgraceful actions taken by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know this. Sunny gives pathetic performance again repeating the same kind of role. A man claims to be fighting for his own piece, using violence. Amisha Patel is the dead hands with an amazing body that loves the bone. But she could not save the film from disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as you usually do, in this film no. She may have played a Muslim role, but she does not act as one in the film. In general, this is a bad show along the way and I'm sure it will attract some people, who love seeing a Bollywood actor beat over 100 young people. Give me a break.
