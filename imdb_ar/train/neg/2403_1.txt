whack!!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed when I discovered that it was like two short scenes near the end. Otherwise you basically press the fast forward button all the time. Some teenagers go on a trip to Romania with their father and are beaten by a wolf and turn into a wolf-wolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and his friends. About 30 years ago but he is not old and is enrolled in high school. There he meets a shy teacher who ends up bitten and then has children with her. I sucked this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read war and peace instead. Mrs. Hartman just did a wonderful job. Check out the young Sagette Bob in this one !!
