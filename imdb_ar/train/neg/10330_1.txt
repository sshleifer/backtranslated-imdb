Wow, here it is at the end; working "film" without work. In a real low budget environment (do not miss out on the cheerful buzz dishes that fly several times) in Seattle, we find a strong, irrational person seeking revenge for her childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing so original or remotely interesting about the plot and the performance of the actors are being rivaled in stupidity only by the attempted theft of other films, especially the "Matrix" without having the money to do it properly. Yes, we see some running on the walls and shooting slowly (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as wonderful as the stupid guy's attempts to make jokes about male inefficiency every now and then. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are also introduced to a number of prospective customers who are nowhere at all, as if the scenario had been thought by the unprecedented crew during filming. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it is as bad as it can get. In fact, it's not worth taking seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not hire it and save your money.
