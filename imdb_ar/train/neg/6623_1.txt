First of all, sorry to give a rating of up to 1 for this movie (none less than this available). The movie failed in each section whether it was a scenario, direction, characterization, or representation. <br /> <br /> 1) Initially, the movie name is really C class (although the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to rise to the level of character, but the weak line coupled with the pathetic trend ends up making him a gay character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 on him (which is convincing). Here in Ag, the 100-kr of Bablan (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our hero and had only a few men's bikes to move around with all the automatic weapons.) Making Sholai in the Mumbai film does not seem convincing. (4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone must tell her that she does not know acting, why does Ram Gopal Ferma cast it over and over? 5) Mohanal was good but barely doing anything. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajbal Yadav, the two best actors, are lost in the film. 7) The mythical role played by Mausi of Basanti in Cholay was cheaply replaced in this film by some Gangu Mummy. Ramo please grow up and understand that some thought is needed in your film. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) I should not say anything about Jai and Veeru talking .. sympathetic to the extreme. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this film because it seems like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Please do not waste money and time in this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst film possible) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible bundle of stupid characters, bad songs and a miserable direction. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Surab
