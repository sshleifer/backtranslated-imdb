The bottom of the barrel, the new edition unimaginable, practically impractical of the road warrior. This film follows the exact outline of the Philippine film STRYKER, which is much worse! Bad representation, dialogue, effects, dubbing, speed, sequence of work ... and the list goes on and on. Italy has actually made dozens of road Warrior coups in the early 1980s, some good and some bad. This is the worst yet, no contest. The mood of the film was not only bleak and miserable, but the experience of sitting in this film bore the hollow and half. There was one (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a wonderful shot of a man carrying a grenade exploding. But everything else about this movie spared seriously! For the real pleasure of having a nuclear weapon, go to a copy of ENDGAME, or after the fall of New York or escape from the Bronx instead. They are much more fun than this garbage.
