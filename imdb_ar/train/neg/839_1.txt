The only part retrieved from this movie is the price you paid. At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and time elapsed as he sat through the bomb. The commander who was responsible for the continuity was absent. When the female and the FBI man went to the location of the alleged killers, Mr. FBI handed the female a gun. When the alleged killer came out of the door, the pistol was magically turned into automatic. Let someone think if a FBP agent will hand over a weapon to a civilian? I do not think so. Ms. Xavier looks very attractive. It is very bad rating R did not allow to see a lot of them. The film editor seems to have cut what might be the best parts of the film.
