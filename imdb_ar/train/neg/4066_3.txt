In the director "ISOYC, IPOYG" directed by Eric Stanzi, three men are tortured by a woman who has all been sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own nonsense, before he is separated from death. The next hole ends with a bullet in the crotch after he refuses to have anal sex with the body of the first man. But this is the third man who makes him the worst: he has to watch "star" Emily Hack with a heavy tattoo, naked and masturbating with a broom handle (oh, and the handle has also pushed his butt!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we (we see her masturbating, that is, we do not get a broom to deal with our wake!). <br /> <br /> Yes, "ISOYC, IPOYG" is a harsh viewing experience, not because of its constant violence, but because of Hack, which is obviously under the misleading notion that it has a goddess body (unlike the image of Rudy of Metallica) For shame. It is not a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the unstoppable hugs of ink-infested Hack, viewers also learn a scary trend from Stanzi (who thinks the endless footage of tombstones and trees are fun things), some of them acting really badly, and a bar The fat man. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I give a rating of "ISOYC, IPOYG" 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than the current 2.9 rate. This is one point of messy messy attack (which, being a hound, I really enjoyed); one point to the little where the fat man gets his face in the chocolate mousse that masquerades as feces (hilarious); and one point indicates that the massive nerve indicates that this The film may well be a complement to the classical exploitation of excellence in Meir Zarchi I Spit On Your Grave.
