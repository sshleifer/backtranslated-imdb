Style but not content. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants. <br /> <br /> This is another thing in this type of film about the difficulties of filmmaking. A young film director was hired to finish a science fiction film in the 1960s codenamed: Dragonfly. Think of Barbarella or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davis is an angry film director. It's not a breakthrough he's an artist. The film he wants to make is a diary of his life. I hardly ever pray. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside Jeremy Davis's film director are as thin as rice paper. Characters that may be interesting, such as his father, Doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzman are introduced as a breakthrough director and then show the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of candy, but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. These funny movies, provocative with sophisticated characters. These films contain lessons applicable to the outside <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy and a comedy, but it is only derivative and there is not one funny scene. The directors describe it as sending, but what is the cynical objective? The actors say it's a tribute but I think I prefer a full version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Obviously Coppola is entertaining through the setting as it is evident from the visual humor of the science fiction movie inside the film. But he failed to share why we should be entertained. <br /> <br /> The science fiction movie is just a mess. There are continuity errors, the director chooses a scientific weapon after being chosen. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene where the filmmaker faces critics who complain about the lack of a story, and the lack of a point, a scene in which he admits intelligently empty does not mean he has addressed these criticisms. <br /> <br /> I think if you have Roman Coppola, you can get away with making a film about an ideal film director who does not know what he wants to say and does not end up saying nothing. In this sense, autobiography may be considered subjective. <br /> <br /> I was watching it in Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. See the Codename name for 15 minutes: Dragonfly movies are included on the DVD as add-ons, then send it back.
