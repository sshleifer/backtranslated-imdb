I have not seen anything terrible like this movie for some time. The film was boring, a long and terrible plot. Special effects sucks like hell - it's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a complete waste for an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was so bad. I saw him in the fraternity squad playing Lt.Speirs band, it was not bad. Actually not bad at all. But in this film, his acting was not convincing enough, he was so bad and there was no chemistry among the rest of the crew. In addition, his eyes look empty like he does not feel them. I was really surprised, because he was good at the fraternity. <br /> <br /> In any case, do not bother to watch this movie. It's a big waste of time. Even if I had to kill an hour or two, I get something else to do besides watching this movie. Trust me, you will regret!
