Yes, I sat in everything, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, the weather was very cold outside, well, all these lame excuses but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> The Darkling has been given 4 stars out of 10 possible movies - I've seen worse movies, but this movie is definitely in the old trash can from a bad film - poor script, bad representation, bad lighting, and influences Special cheesy. <br /> <br /> The story, which does not seem quite logical, revolves around this small, simple family, the father, the mother, and the little girl - in which I suppose the viewer is supposed to be with the viewers, all of whom were boring And disturbing. You just want to get the dark side on each of them. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a cook for his car hobby. Baba meets a rich man named Robben who collects cars and also holds what he bought in the "mysterious" Orient. Robin keeps it in the bird cage and is referred to as "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the movie, Darkling is described as about 3 or 4 different things: shadow without a person, the inner darkness that is in us all, and the devil. So choose what suits you from any of these explanations - because trust me, it does not really matter. <br /> <br /> It seems that the main problem of Darkling is that she yearns to have a companion - she gets a human companion - and then in the end is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to enormous wealth, followed by disaster, for humans who deal with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us - it only leads to a very long and boring film. <br /> <br />
