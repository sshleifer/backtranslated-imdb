A little dreary makes no sense of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Badly written, with coarse and wooden dialogue. Do not care if the characters (in fact, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Small blessing or charm, little work, small point to everything. Some may concern the group and the preparation - these gaps between boards in all buildings may be correct in the way life is lived. The face of the frame is not necessary and fragmented, and the character of the Cassidy Hoopalong itself is dull and incompetent.
