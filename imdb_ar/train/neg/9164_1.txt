I must start by saying that I am a huge romantic. Hence I really wanted to love this film. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching him. Leap Years tells the story of Li-Ann, full of fate, who competes with Jeremy the slave and commits to meet every leap year. The premise is very romantic, based on a fantastic short story and with a representative you do not seem to be watching a flick about Jack Newe. Then why oh why is it so bad? First, I felt that the filmmakers thought they were filming a music video, because they chose to replace storytelling and any real feelings with cheesy editing, predictable actions and clich√©d lines. I was upset because I was one of the few in Singapore to see "leap years," but those of us in the cinema would agree that our sealed ears in talkable presentations talk volumes. I hope to watch a romantic film that goes beyond Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy to date, and Leap years are not near. Some blogs have described "years of waste" as harsh but ultimately real. Do not waste your money or your emotions as you did. The film will make you give up love forever.
