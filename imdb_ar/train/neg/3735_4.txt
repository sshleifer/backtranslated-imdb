Actress Patty Duke wrote a brilliant, funny, and cruel book about her career as an actress, about her life, her sweet love, her comic and comic games, and the suicide attempts that almost kept her away forever. With this rich and dependable article from (and lead by Patty her role in the final film), one might think that a famous television director like Gilbert Cates could all bring them together in the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of the biographies of Duke. For those who have not read the book, the innovative narrative (jump forward in time) is incomprehensible, we are never allowed to get what we have, and what seems to be a halt to production with a low budget. The actors are wrong, and the value of Duke's appearance on its own does not bear fruit - the false reality of the film is too thick at this stage so that Patty can not stabilize the scenario. It seems as if the producers were sufficiently sincere (and mind-conscious) to steer the film impatiently towards the ultimate Duke diagnosis and mental freedom, but they ruled out many exciting opportunities in the process.
