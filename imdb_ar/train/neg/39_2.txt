A filmmaker was kidnapped in Africa and taken to the forest where she was detained for ransom. The product employs someone to go and return them. The complexity of everything is the cannibals in the forest who worship the "god" ugly really likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> It's a hilarious movie. There are abundant amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. It is a film of exploitation designed to attract the deepest parts of our sorrows, and if the film is not boring, it will be a classic film. Let's face it, despite the nonsense, bad sex, abuse, and the ugly monster this movie is a snooze. The speed of everything is outside the kilter which puts you outside. There are many lines of conspiracy that seem to all happen separately from each other, although it is ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the simple dialogue concerns the harsh or personal protests that "I will do what I want." It is a film so quiet and boring that if it is not for the repeated screams of the victims, I recommend this as a sleep assistant. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you should avoid unless you need to sleep, or you do not need to watch every movie "cannibal" in Europe. <br /> <br /> This VideoAsia has just been released as part of the Terrorist Tales series, whose print is oddly written on the letters and appears to be the result of taking their prints from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that has been cropped to remove translations.
