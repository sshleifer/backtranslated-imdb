There are too many secondary plot lines without one basic. Many of the hot buttons were pressed without any reason, and they were able to stuff this boring film, and that does not say anything, with every dramatic element: death, divorce, money issues, parenting, suicide, Love rejection, travel problems, sex, generations of misunderstanding, theft, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep real love" ?? Do you think it would make for an interesting movie, but no hell? All these events are secondary to something fundamental and there is none. boring. Not to mention that the lecture "super-depth" (and long) for the child at the end of the film is pure nonsense. Pity. <br /> <br /> Oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all good. This prevented me from turning it off. Unfortunately for their talents get lost, the film is also well illustrated: light, motion, etc. in each episode - all in its proper place. It's just meaning missing.
