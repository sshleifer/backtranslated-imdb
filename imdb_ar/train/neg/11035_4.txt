This is the most ridiculous romance that its session. The perfect film for a dead housewife in a handkerchief, a housewife, and the high-heeled mules stuffed with the ostrich to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbon. In fact, the balloon plays a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was able to see it to the end is that I finally managed to see the face of Keanu Reeves the dreamer in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves very quickly to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, waving his hands with a more Latin-Italian passion than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is as rough as wood. Unfortunately, no body is being torn - the hero is humiliating and polite. Cliches of the ancient aristocratic aristocratic family of old-fashioned hills. What does it matter if they are Irish, Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew before the end of the titles that this would not be the movie I had hoped for. The glowing grape was similar to the model of all food advertisements in Women's Day magazine. I could not find his name on the list, but the director was definitely Thomas Kincad, who painted the millions of dollars of paintings from the ruined Irish huts in Fushia. This film was literally seen through pink glasses. If you love the dream sky pink and blue, this movie is suitable for you! (Bonbon looks really good, too!)
