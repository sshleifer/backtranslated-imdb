There were some scary scenes, which I always liked more than Gore, but this film was fairly weak. There were many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain anything in the film, it was still somewhat unclear. After watching this movie, I'm still lost in many ways. That reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This film was also unsatisfactory, but it is still better because it tried to work and the story is already logical. This one, not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the representation of the abandoned was appropriate, but the film continued to show and never offered any kind of satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise, this movie was in a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
