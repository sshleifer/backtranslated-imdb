Simply put, this is the worst film since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked this movie, you might like this movie). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? Some ideas should remain just an idea. The fact that this idea is conceivable must be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about it I hear you ask. One word ... everything. <br /> <br /> Cost to rent: $ 4.50 Cost in time for viewing: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund for both!
