This is the most sad group of cliches, interlocking together on a straight line, with no clear plot or any decent way of acting I have seen for a long time. Canibalising scenes of Star Wars, the reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went into a full-scale war on the intelligence viewer. Was this film good? It was not a film at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it's not too low to be really funny and cultivating a comedy, the film gives some laughter. The trick is to put scenes copied in the context of their original movies. Gandalf can be a funny Korean speaking, or a basil-shaped snake that is a joy if compared to a small game, and evil followers can offer a lot of fun in his hands Suron and Jaga Ping, or whatever his name. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: any fun derived from this film depends entirely on the state of poisoning and the imagination of the viewers, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
