I can not believe how far this film has not been learned. It's like watching a police academy, except for people who have no idea what they're talking about ... and ... wait, there's a stupid robot supposed to be a side-friend. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but that's just a complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot for this film. It's like watching a person pretend to be a doctor and giving non-medical words as if he were the chief of staff at a large medical facility. In addition, people wear inappropriate clothing for the space program. I feel like I'm watching the movie "B" for girls Valley, in space.
