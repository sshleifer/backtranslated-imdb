It is true that some Peter Sellers fans may be disappointed with this latest project. But surely any of the Sellers' fans will find joy in all his movies, simply because of the huge man's talent. The demonic plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, this may be the latest film Sellers, (released even after his death), but it is still good to see how a man managed to maintain his irreplaceable talent until his sudden death. Not only do we have one of the sellers, but also because Sellers not only plays a role in the title, but also his opponent, Nayland Smith, who is equally curious, is searching for the 168-year-old Fu. The Strange Story We equally follow an outrageous faux alien to make him elixir defy age as well as Nayland and a group of his partners try to stop him. Just like any of the great Sellers, the film comes with flawless performance, along with many of his familiar stars - David Tomlinson, Sid CÃ©sar, John Le Misorier, Clive Den and Helen Mirren. Few. It's also good to see a strong Pant showed that he has a great star with the sellers - though he plays the same role, but it's still nice. The story is truly ironic, as are many of the characters involved, who classify this film as a film under the influence of Goon. Although it does not reach its climax in the Goon comedy, there are plenty of entertaining jokes that seem to indicate the right direction. The movie failed commercially in its premiere because of the mourning of the whole world after the death of the sellers (the movie was shown less than 3 weeks ago) and there is always that sad idea in your mind when you see that this was one of the last movie sellers. It's far from a wonderful movie - it's often slow and very silly, and sometimes there are not just jokes - but it's fun though - if only for a higher rate of Peter Sellers.
