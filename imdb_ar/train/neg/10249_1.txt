What can I say about this film other than "I do not see it". I waited and waited and waited for something (or anything) to happen and did not happen. Watch amazingly while two people walk around during record setup for most of the full-screen time in a single movie. What do they do? Do they solve the mystery? Do they collect clues? Maybe, it's hard to say that. At the end of the film, after decoding a lot of radio signals (illegally on the type of PET display screens) and this guy is giving some lectures, the plot is finally unveiled and thrown aside as soon as possible. Some foreigners want to return to the virtuous city of their original world and are so happy there that they want to blow up the land (I think they do not like sharing wealth). I think they finished filming and saw their work or art for 35 minutes (garbage!) And decided to let the editorial team turn it into a feature film of 88 minutes. See at your own risk, it's not funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
