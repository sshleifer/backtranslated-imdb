Warning: Review contains corrupt spoilers <br /> <br /> There is a parallel world there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, controversial and controversial film. Unfortunately in this dimension, Gone became ... a flashy joker and lead the testosterone starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not really worth getting into, he and a large number of his friends have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, one of which only has a warning. This crew consists of the man with the biting ears that is rumored to be the new Superman; the man who ran the electricity in the ex files; a former professional footballer and two of the distinctive black men. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are cops, robbers of rival cars and Bilburu of Kraker, his suit in Manchester has been properly settled and expanded to the American masses who are now accustomed to this type of thing since Daphne in Fraser. There is also Angelina Jolie, who does not get any personality; except to be a pot for the sexual desires of men. She and Cage are supposed to be old hippies, which is strange, since they had nothing approaching a normal conversation all the time, watching the 135-meter-long movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so poor that whenever a person has a "moment" the violin plays in the background to highlight "emotion." It is not the spoiler to discover that Finney Jones (who rephrases Paul Gasgwin's famous "handball" and its threat in silence) receives only one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot but because his eloquent summary of dubious ethics For the film after it seemed mute all the way funny. Allegedly. After struggling through the completely unrepresented "London essay," she will do it, Cage said. "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you might imagine, were really good and amazing. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the most sophisticated aspect, from the unmistakable cop cop to the two distinctive black characters. This sees the greater part of Hollywood taking hold; why can not a black man appear in a master image without constantly realizing the color of his skin and referring to it endlessly? The younger man, who speaks, like the elder, talks about the drought for so long, declares: "We blacks do not like the cold ... we are a tropical people." Then goes on to express the desire to smoke detailed and watch the roots. Of course, he ridicules the image of blacks, but how funny? His older counterpart can not speak without mentioning himself, and thus his color, in a third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" it. Does anyone know any black person actually talking like this? Do not think. <br /> <br /> The movie's soundtrack plays almost non-stop and with increasing volume, some tracks - notably the "Do not Stop Rock" song at Apollo 440 - are so loud that they are actually more vocal than sound effects and dialogue. The system around the two separates the two so that it looks like two different voices working together. There is no background music concept here, it is the audio equivalent of trying to watch a movie while someone at the back of the cinema has its full voice. "Keep this music down, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and in many ways I enjoyed it. It is just predictable, lazy and fragrant, with minimal effort to build. It seems that the box office expectations have dropped significantly for this film. It seems that the public is beginning to wake up to this fact after being exposed to an undesirable risk for several years
