*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> From here on in the entire film collapses on itself. First, we meet a rogue program with the indication that we will get ghosts, vampires, wolves and the like. We get a man with a backward accent talking about endless garbage, "ghosts" do not serve any real purpose and have no personality whatsoever and a group of followers. Someone told me they were vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they were so unknown that I did not realize. <br /> <br /> The funny funny man with the funny name has the same Oracle problem, just for much longer and much worse. He has a simple point about the cause and effect, makes them, then continues to make them and even make them crooked and stupid. His final line before walking outside is similar to the storm line "Do you know what happens to the frog ..." in the X-men at levels of absolute misfortune. The chocolate cake is a cliche, pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci, where the wife does nothing but expect exactly the moment we see her. <br /> <br /> Then we get another kung fu battle !!! why? Neo is, purportedly, one. He can do anything. He has absolute power and what he uses for it. Kung Fu bloody all the time. Although he is able to stop 1000 bullets, he is still being cut off by the sword and is still making a meal of 5 uninvolved followers (vampires?). I wanted to see the mind blowing powers. I wanted to see him doing the most insane and crazy people because he could do anything. I got the same as before without "wow". <br /> <br /> The legendary car hunt. This can not be bad. Well ... no, not so. Not just what we used to be. All the wonderful shots from this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So maybe every wow was taken from us so all we got now is a good chase sequence with, guess what, kung fu battle !!! Well, it's not new, but you think he has made it clear to his close friends about the reality of the matrix. At least teach them something. This is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Morpheus, do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix, it's not real, as long as you realize that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> There you go. simple. <br /> <br /> Well, so the chase is not bad. It's not boring and does not look like 16 minutes. It is very frustrating. However, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The climax of the last film may be the worst imaginable. They have this full plan involving three crews. They then show only sporadically between the long-preached Morphius monologue. To make matters worse, they do not clearly define what is a plan that needs 3 teams. You know mainly, but you do not know who does what, when, so when one crew drops, do not care and do not know how it will affect what happens. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this happens so that the Trinity can return to the matrix to prepare the end. That is the only reason that happens. Which raises the question, why do they need to send 6 people originally? Enter the Trinity within five minutes of its own! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the matrix center (speaking) is treated equally. Ooohhh !!! Running to 100 other Smiths customers !!! Woooooo !!! I must have taken a lot of thinking. Now only they are in the arcade so the battle has no scope and ended in a moment. Man, what a great conclusion !!! <br /> <br /> Then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Do you remember that everything I said was bad for Oracle or the foreign man? Add them together and double it, which is really amazing architect. His only reasonable possibility is that he is about to prepare the peak of cliffhanging. <br /> <br /> Then blow it up! <br /> <br /> Let's look at the options it offers for Neo. Choose one Pope and die all mankind (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all the humans are dying! Consideration of choice is something this film tries to explore and does not really give it a hero. If he has the option of saving humanity and dying Miss or save Miss and kill humanity there is potnetial of torment and internal tension. Also, with the Trinity being in mid-autumn, the potential of a true cliffhanger made the third vision more important. but not. He did not save anyone or save the mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst thing about the original matrix is ​​the new death and then back to life in the end. In the year he went out, everyone was disturbed by the extent of a stupid jar jar that did not notice that the end of the matrix made him look like Stephen Hawking. "Oracle told me I would fall in love with one, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How can the whole world miss the extent to which this was terrible? <br /> <br /> So, what does Wachowski do in the sequel? Well, it makes the end of the original look better. What? Well, by doing almost exactly the same thing (only switching letters) is much worse, I think that the r and r keys will be ignored if I continue to write before I get worse. <br /> <br /> The cliffhanger is not just a cliffhanger really. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is bad. I really do not want to be bad, but it is. Bad in a lot of ways. To make matters worse, this is not a film with enough budget. It's not a film with a very short timeline. It's not a fast-moving movie. It is a film that does not have much influence from outside. This is exactly the film prepared by Wachowski to create a fortune that Warner completely left behind. This is what makes this very awful. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it did not get enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. Worst film ever? Probably not quite. The film is the most frustrating and frustrating to produce it at all. <br /> <br /> Undeniable. <br /> <br />
