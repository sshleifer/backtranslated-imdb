I gave it only 2 because Natalia Malt (like Quintana Vampire) looks very exciting in this film. <br /> <br /> Certainly there is little logic to this film, but most vampires click. Maybe the film tried to stay away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only reasonable but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes that made me feel sick. A good vampire film should make sense that you do not need to see too much blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a person he / she will do what the vampire will do. There are some things that need to be described for the scene (like the scene in the end when Quintana tries to stir up a sexual Rosa, all you need is a little whine, and the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
