Has anyone edited this movie? Or is it just a DVD version that had huge gaps in 32nd scenes? All is well, I was asleep watching her the first time. Then she fell asleep for the second time and the third time. The plot is not actually the worst I've ever seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I've ever seen ... but it's close. Production .... well, I can honestly say it was the worst I have ever seen! I do not try to be clever, but Unhinged could have used some of the production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think I hate horror movies, or even I did not enjoy this movie. I felt I was laughing more at the film than I did with it. The terrible moments were not very bad, but they could have been done even better with a volatile budget. <br /> <br /> Characters appeared awkwardly developed, or were ignored together, the twisted end was very bad, and the show took forever without exposing too much. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
