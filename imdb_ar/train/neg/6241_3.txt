The thing that does not really match the Gore theory (and its supporters) is all about "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there is such unanimity, why are the "believers" in the shadow of global warming Almighty feel the concrete need to try to bully anyone who interrogates them. <br /> <br /> Why face anyone not The GWP makes misleading accusations that it is either stupid or on the oil companies' payrolls (obviously you are a professional GWP expert who does not mean you are on the payroll of anyone in this wonderful world ...) Why is there a need to tell everyone how to settle the entire question , And when is the nature of science to ask frankly about assumptions? For some ideas about answering these questions , Read Breez by the famous oil expert Michael Crichton ... Oh wait, it's rich and not on the oil companies' lists, he took a great risk of not sticking to the Green Line and the other two Kyoto slaves and telling them the truth while he was in. Almost all the questions that Al Gore has kept away from, fearing that he will not get every penny from the environmental lobby if he decides to run again. <br /> <br /> So who In his mind ..?
