Bela Lugosi plays the role of a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife young and beautiful. To this end, he markets the brides during their wedding ceremonies to make them look as if they were dead so they could steal their bodies. I'm not sure exactly what to do with the bodies. I do not remember that it was ever fully explained. All I know is that he gets something out of them and pumps it into his wife. (I only think it was a spinal fluid, the backbone of the spine was all the rage of mad scientists in the 1940s). You can guess the rest largely from here. <br /> <br /> There's a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I'll just write about two) of the problems I'm having with this movie. One is the method of using Bella. Sure, he does a decent enough job in his own way of exaggeration (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply bad). But making it hide in the back of a heart or making it sneak into a journalist's bedroom to do nothing is ridiculous. Also, why beat him and / or kill all the followers he has? Do you make him look evil? Well, the person who snatches brides with a coma really does not need more evil. <br /> <br /> The second problem I face is the idea of ​​puppet anesthesia. Why brides? Will not any female under 20? Watching Bella passing through these generations to bring his victims, I remembered the stupid fisherman in "I still know what I did last summer." In each case, there seems to be an easier way to reach your goal than using an apparently impossible plan that depends on a lot of circumstances beyond your control. (BTW, an alternative title for this film is "The Case of Missing Puppies." I think that partly explains the need for "brides.")
