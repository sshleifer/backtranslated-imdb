This horrific film brings together every Asian stereotype you can imagine in one awful package. Lying money, committed Japanese businessmen send police officer Pat Morita a cop but beloved to recover industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he collides with a heel at the bottom of Jay Leno, who immediately points to the victim of murder as a Jap and invites Tourette Morita. It's all downhill from there.
