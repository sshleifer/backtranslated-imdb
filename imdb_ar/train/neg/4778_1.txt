This is the worst show I've seen in years. I think it should be removed from T.V. Because of its delay. It's stupid that I'm fainted when I see him. (Although I never saw him because he was poor). <br /> <br /> Idiot: When Mac says he can not; eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world contains sugar in it !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster" when the whirl screams in Terrance, he fell into the box twice as well as the time he fell into it, and did not fall into the side. What stupid. I can not even say the word Foster Home. I made a song with my band about how late this show was. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
