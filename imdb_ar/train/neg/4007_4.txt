I hope that whoever trains these losers on their dialects has been fired. The only high points are a few supporting characters, 3 of 5 of the favorites were killed by the end of the season (and one was a cat to put it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampire, gay sex with vampire gay, gay sex with vampire straight, sex to record vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex vampire front, sex vampire, sex Non-vampire, sex because we are afraid of vampires, sex because we are angry with vampires, sex because we have become vampires, and so on. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it was a bit more subtle with getting into the story. Maybe you have a story then boot some sex into it. But they did not bother to do it ... Anna Pachin is a prostitute in a tooth gap. Either she sucked or sucked her personality, I can not tell which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the story story I find is largely unbelievable is why the 150-year-old vampire Bell seems to combine things interested in someone like Suki. It constantly flies from the handle toward things that it can not control. Leaves for two days already decided that he "will not come back" and suddenly has feelings for the dog man? Give me a break. She is supposed to be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her die everywhere, and she has a bright smile on her face because she gave the V card only to some dude because she can not read her mind? As the main character of the story, I wish the show would do a bit more to make it understandable and to invest someone you care about, not someone secretly hoping to be killed or put into a coma. I can not find anything about her personality that I love, and even the fact that she can read minds is not impressively inspirational and not least interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my time watching the second season come June.
