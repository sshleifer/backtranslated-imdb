Along with the bright films of the 1970s and 1980s, films dealing with the dead may have been the second most popular sub-horror genre. While the curly movies had a "black birthday" and "Halloween" to get everything, the zombie films contained the films "Dead" by George Romero. Not surprisingly, shortly after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to take advantage of it. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us "zombie" a year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead." , Known as "Zombi" in Italy and some other countries, there was a film called "Zombi 2". Apart from the walking dead, it has nothing to do with Romero, but it is a good film in itself. It has been a great success in Europe, and after 9 years was born a sequel. <br /> <br /> FEATURES: Lots of beautiful and leafy landscapes. The result is terrible. The acting is not quite good, but the cast is a game and they seem to enjoy the experience. After a kind of slow start, the pace moves like the speed of motion. A lot of cheese and hilarity is not intended for bad film lovers. Good post on make-up effects. Lots of blood and some decent gaps. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: I draw almost less. Nothing you did not see before some things were clearly torn from the first couple of movies "Return of the Living Dead". Characters of cardboard. She was not old enough because of bad rock music in the 1980s (I do not say that all the rock music at that time was bad), the clothes, the general feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: First of all, this is not a real complement to the classic Vulse cult. In fact, I do not know if it's supposed to pick up where the movie stopped. For those who did not know, Folsi was sick during production and ended up being replaced by Bruno Matte. Mattei movies are very laughable, but like this movie, many of them are very enjoyable. That's all in this film really, just something you can watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (Very bad rating, good) 2/5 (serious rating)
