So I look forward to renting a DVD and watched this movie called "The End Game". Starring James Woods and Cuba Gooding Jr. and has a summary of the political thriller. Well worth a look then. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End Game has almost a more silly plot than I have ever felt in permanent dissatisfaction. Now that I have been doing something dear, I can not really destroy it as I want without destroying it for those who have not yet experienced this monster. But questions such as "Why did they do this?" , And "Where did they get the land on the resources needed to pull this out?" Are all very plentiful after the conclusion of the hilarious movie inadvertently. <br /> <br /> As for the representation - you know those movies where you can almost feel that the actor realized that they made a serious mistake in signing in to the movie, which then appears in their performance? This is one of these. This is accompanied by a laughable script, a seriously flawed and irritating direction and a recipe for film. <br /> <br /> Of course, this has not reached the cinema, and for the same reason, you should not allow him to enter your living room; it's horrible.
