Here we are: two travelers from a distant future world to Earth ... one on a desperate mission to save life, and the other is an inhumane killing machine designed to eliminate a woman who will give birth to the entire sex savior. <br /> <br /> So what can we call this killing machine? It looks like it looks like some type of destroyer or remover ... looks like a pesticide or something like that. What is the word I am looking for ... something that eliminates things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> In any case, the garrison (which quickly lifts a white jacket stolen from Luke Skywalker for local clothes) finds the young woman first and drinks it with a future-born hero to be. The evil evil ... the "pesticide" kills some of the retarded and steals their weapons and clothes, and then tries to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking about her by looking at a threat in the eyes of people and repeating her name seriously. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race to survive, while the seemingly non-stop "pesticide" seems to haunt the couple all over the countryside. At some point, I might get shoes and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, at an exciting conclusion, he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge tank truck filled with. Acid. Then the truck will crash. Will be saved ... but not! He will then emerge, as strong as ever. The guard will be killed and the girl will be pursued at a meat-packing plant, where he will eventually be pushed to a large piece of industrial shredding machines and destroyed once and for all. After all, I did not stop watching this movie after Mr. Brutrick charmed Sean Young in a magical way by kissing her in a bar and then told her that the baby would be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> Fashion and effects are great in this movie ... I loved it the first time I saw it on Star Trek: The next generation too! Shaun Young plays another great role in a non-stirring recurring role, and the pig in the race career Stephen Baldwin is also in the role of Youngs Fat Cobb Boyander. I'm not sure of his location in the plot though ... Maybe he is importing from a different James Cameron movie?
