I wanted to see this movie since it was first announced on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see it last night at 7:40. I regret the day I wasted my ticket on this garbage when I saw something better. The beginning was all a bunch of nationality and cliches. They exaggerated the way love actually worked. All the girls were stereo types. The friend was very stupid for his age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl had kept barely laughed. The bank robbery was quite boring with the gags used in other films. Their old smuggled car was Cheven Van Chevy who claimed he had no breaks. Hey why did not they get a nice girl car to steal instead? It may have strengthened public opinion about the film. This film was very low, low, low, and budgeted because there was no damage or damage to this site. This film had a lot of things that would push Christians nuts. Hi, I was expecting a scene to chase cars because all bank robberies had car chases, but I never found them. So this film was made with a low budget and 1 out of 10 stars.
