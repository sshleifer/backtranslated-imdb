Vampires cyborgs rule the world and use human blood as fuel, yet there will be a shift in power thanks to dissident Android (Chris Christoferson) and a warrior woman (Cathy Long) while facing Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who plays Cyborg in this funny film) All the questions left unanswered for this horrific film, the most moving was the idea of ​​who is to cast country singer Chris Christoferson as a warrior Cyborg able to deliver the best he gets. No, do not get me wrong, I've seen that Christoferson is a security guard or something but not a cyborg. It is curious that one of them doubted that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have the wisdom not to do so. But despite the disaster, Christoferson is the most easily enjoyable thing in the film. He gives a much more humane performance then Kathy Long is impolite. (And Christoferson plays a robot) Despite the errors, Christoferson provides a few moments of attention. Lance Henriksen is wasted and Gary Daniels is lost but the horsemen basically fail. You stand in horror wondering who thought hell that this was a good idea on paper. (This is the film in which Christoferson fights broken robots in a backpack) and worst of all ends in whether to complement, thankfully this has not been achieved yet although I still have nightmares to suggest the possibility of such an event. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
