After watching a highly censored copy of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more sincere and acted well than I remembered, but one thing really came out. I think other reviewers have also mentioned this, what exactly are the nature and personal motivations of Chris Sarandon? Have other victims raped before? Is it purely psychotic or "average" social? How was he expected to escape his attack on the younger sister? Is this personality credible at all, or is it just a more necessary background issue? He almost simultaneously appears to be an unbelievable character, so insane that he can not really hold on to the teaching function that makes him in contact with the young and vulnerable girls. This appears to be the biggest complaint to viewers in general. Has nothing to do with his performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies an unstable position between absolute exploitation and serious treatment of the subject, without complete settlement in either situation. It was not the worst movie ever, but not all that good, either.
