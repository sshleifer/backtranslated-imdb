I loved Diwiri in the Nawar series. His trivial talent at the Walters is nicknamed "places to go". Well, it's a couple of players who boast of tradition in the most ridiculous and irreparable way; many people find such behavior amusing. It was a boring, useless exercise aimed at shock. I find the smile on the face of the pailer, the face behind the camera, annoying. The Noir series was a true expression of personal freedom and blatant behavior. From the very first moment we see Patrick Diwere advancing in the abandoned draw, we get the idea of ​​a nice beloved hero and spend time with him in the next few hours. When we see him chasing the unfortunate middle-aged female with his girlfriend Depardieu in the "places to go", we warn that spending two hours with these classes will be a drain of the same. I have a problem in eking up "3" for this annoying distraction.
