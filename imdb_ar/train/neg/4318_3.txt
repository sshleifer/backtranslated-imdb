I thought this was one of the most frustrating holiday films I have ever seen - and other movies are Christmas and his wife. The three films are all about death. If you like total depression, then watch this movie or any of the other movies. In this film, the representation is good and some landscapes (apart when people die) are beautiful. But I'm worried that someone who is clinically depressed may see the film accidentally and perform its role! Despite the end of "permanent happiness", the bulk of this film is a terrible disaster after another. For crazy reasons, I do not want to be depressed when I watch a Christmas movie (I know that sounds like crazy people - after all, do not fool your eyes and feel miserable about what the holidays are about anyway?). <br /> <br /> For a more enjoyable viewing experience, try the Forgotten Guest House without a Christmas tree, George Carroll Scott at Christmas Carol or the Christmas story instead - unless of course you like to be miserable.
