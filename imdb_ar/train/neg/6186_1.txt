The abuse occurs. Susanna Yorke is a young luminous Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35 years old. White-haired George C. Scott appears to have rheumatoid arthritis. It's a squeak and roar, hateful and grim. It is like an ax killer who has sent his ax to sharpen it; we are not surprised that he keeps his wife in the attic! The great story of love seems like a nightmare of Masochi Sadu. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Ronchester Bronte is relatively young, athletic, strong, and charming when he chose to be. He has a good voice in speaking and singing, a good mind, and a conscience tries to slander in vain.
