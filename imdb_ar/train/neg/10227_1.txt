This is a good story about a man getting married to escape the hangman's rope, then begins to "tame" his reluctant bride. He is capable of being biased to racism and racism at the same time. We never discovered, for example, why a woman who had won respect for an Indian warrior was unable to confront her ex-husband. Or why her teammates long for a "real man" in the saddle when they seem to be taking care of things just fine. This was only logical in the 1950s in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There is a really stupid scene where you install it and catch the whip - the second time - and then take it out of her horse. Do not mind that the first time you may have lost his eye, making it very hard to grab this whip! And then reigns in a battle against its Indian goalkeeper, where he spends two-thirds of the first hitting the pulp. This is some second wind. Later, he managed to negotiate with some bloodthirsty Indians (because they were all in these clicks) after they rejected her now became his "plight". It does not matter that he has zero diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. The way in which she continues to reject her attempts to seduce him just to keep her anxious and prevent her from sticking to it - yes, it is true. Like women throwing themselves along the road. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of the roles is convincing. Madison is just a jerk that is incredibly unlucky. Fleming flips her hair and grumbles a lot, but she is not entirely convincing as a raging girl. The only reason that makes you root for her is that you want to see Madison tied to a runaway horse and run over a cliff before the end of the movie. The way that Madison Fleming promotes it is very predictable and has few obstacles to make you angry if you see women as anything but blow-ups. Even if you see them as a puppet, the total lack of suspense will endure. <br /> <br /> Total time consuming even a boring Kinda scene. Give this one a big miss.
