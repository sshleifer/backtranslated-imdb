One of the real clinker Boris Karloff. Basically, the Karlov (who was looking for 120 years older than his) is a scientist in need of money to end his experiences before his death. Moving from Morocco, where he is financed by someone else, goes to the south of France where he works as a doctor while trying to get rid of enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, a deal is held with the rich young wife of a lumbar Baron dying. He will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and continue to giggle (which I think is married). If you think I got it from watching the movie that I was wrong, I had to read what the others posted to see what happened. why? Because this movie has been lost to me two minutes ago. I had no idea what was going on with his many characters and multiple plot lines. A little is explained and not much is said to the end where I did not really care. It's a boring mess of pure interest to Karloff's performance which is somewhat strange at times. To be honest this is the only time I have ever seen in Bella's exotic Lugosi adventure. Not every scene but little makes me wonder how far they stop.
