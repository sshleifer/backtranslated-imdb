If you like "Pulp Fiction" and like handheld cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the strange story (although I feel that "Pulp Fiction" was the most appreciated film since "The English Patient") and found that the characters are unrealistic but interesting. It is not "on the waterfront" or "citizen citizen" and burdened with European burdens. But the worst part is the hand-held camera. It was disturbing and annoying that I found myself waiting desperately until the film ended. I do not know why the new directors think the shooting method is so wonderful. If you are susceptible to motion, keep away, the handheld camera will cause nausea in 10 minutes.
