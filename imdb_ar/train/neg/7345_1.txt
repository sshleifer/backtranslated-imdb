I hate this program completely, what kind of people are sitting and watching this garbage? Well my father and mom loved them lol but I make sure I get out of the room well before he gets up. It is very frustrating and depressing but the worst thing about it is acting. I can not stand on all the detective programs like this because the interrogators are very wooden and heartless. What happened to the secret detective programs real ??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters do not know anything about them died more than 20 years ??? I hope the BBC will put more comedy on bbc1 cos now that MP Debley has finished having more space for such crap.
