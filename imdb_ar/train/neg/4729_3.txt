Live a little, LOVE A LITTLE is one of the strangest films of Elvis. Fragment part, fluff part, surreal part and strange part. Elvis meets a girl outside her voice with a loud voice. It's like Jennifer Aniston. The story is not as logical as with most Elvis Presley films, and there are a bunch of bizarre characters. There is not much music in this one, but what I liked there, although there is nothing unforgettable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carrie go to her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a boy comes in broad daylight! What?? This is about the essence of the film. What?? Oh, two good things about the film: a) Elvis looks great and b) the dog steals the show.
