What is the deal with the clothes? They were dressed like something from the early 1980s in the early 1980s. The cars were old. The school was old. The nuns' clothes were old, and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with wooden wings and ladders and things. There was nothing in the whole film implied that it happened in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying "Geeeee-od! When was this film made?" When we pressed "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 should have been a typo! Did anyone else notice this? My favorite part was when the woman told her friendly husband, by phone, about the cross inverted in the mirror, saying only, "Well, look, I've had a meeting in Congress, I'll talk to you about it later." Just like a man! It was my mom's favorite part when they gave the "Spawn the Devil Child" to her Rottweiler. My mother's favorite part was the man in the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, He was driving directly to the dumpster / dump truck / front loader, and he had about 20 seconds to turn off the car ... but he kept walking, with a really stupid empty look on his face ... I mean, how fast can you go in the parking lot School?!? Whatever!
