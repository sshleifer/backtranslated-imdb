This was, by far, the worst film I've ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover seemed to be a decent horror film. I did not know that the cover would be the best part of the film. where do I start? The film was filthy and tedious. At some point, there is a minute-long scene where nobody speaks, just a car driving to a farm on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they drove in silence. The whole film is boring, with an annoying, incredible dialogue, and basically no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie, be sure to watch it with some friends and make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
