Well, what can I say about this film. I can not Talk. I can continue to talk about how stupid this film is forever, even though the only thing that amazes me is music. More importantly, someone commented on how much they liked her. To them all I am saying is that he was taken from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof Fury starring Bruce Lee. If he is still alive, he has seen this film again and again. The rest of the film is very ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say the tape because such a film could not have been filmed in the film. I am now stupid to waste 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only reason I saw that was that my roommate had downloaded it out of curiosity. What this world is coming to.
