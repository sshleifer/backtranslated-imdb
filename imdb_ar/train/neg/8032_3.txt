This was a great representation with famous stars such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a group of lesser known names but shorter roles. It also has Technicolor, one of the few films I made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... Unfortunately, I can not say much about the positive story. The James boys were photographed in a completely positive light .... and Hollywood has done it ever since. Why these criminals are always shown as "good people" is far from me. This film glitters them and makes their enemies - the people of the railroad - into evil human beings. The latter was greatly exaggerated was Magdi. Well, this is a movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a flash of news - James's children were criminals! Really - look for it!
