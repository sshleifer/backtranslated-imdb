I'm not sure who writes these glowing <br /> <br /> comments for this movie, but trust me that they are STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and vulgar jokes, and this is a lame movie, only about 80 minutes long, and believe me that's all I can do. The plot is terrible, the representation is worse. There is no evolution at all. <br /> <br /> David Cocteau's films are even better. Run away from Jeju. I was expecting to hate acting, which can be forgiven directly for videos, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This was not scary, and very little of Gore, <br /> <br /> The staff is really unattractive. <br /> <br /> I saw this with three other friends <br /> <br /> who I hope will continue to talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to get out of the disk from the window. I can not believe anyone can be <br /> <br /> given this good review tripe.
