If you've heard of these three words that have been spoken to you ... "Joe Don Becker", be scared ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a low budget motion film based on a Texas police mayor named Geronimo ( Pronounced on behalf of Heronimo). He is a nasty, dirty and rude character looking for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually retreated twice in the film. Too bad editing. Joe Don Becker (Geronimo) ends up jailed like 4 or 5 times in this film, making the plot not go fast. In addition, everyone is shot as if in the Wild West. I think nobody told him it was in the 20th century. A female policeman has been appointed to show him all over Malta (which is similar to Elaine from Seinfeld) and is the only one who can afford the underdog. Must be crazy! <br /> <br /> Strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this film. Their dance is performed throughout the film and began to link with the women who are flirtatious. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo as he tries to get rid of something. The end is flawed and fairly predictable, and I was glad it finally ended. Never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to imagine how it was in Three Bond films ... very strange! Anyway, if you laugh, look for this on the MST3K at some point. Also, I heard his bad film (among many), the release of "Mitchell" MST3K on DVD from Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
