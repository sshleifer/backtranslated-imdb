Jie, what a movie heck! ... I said I wanted to become a bad film specialist from all the contracts, so I decided to start with this film. It was a very appropriate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I have never seen anything like that in this pastel-colored mess. I have not seen a lot of bad movies before, but I felt that this is called "very bad and that's good", maybe because it's too funny unintentionally! First of all, there is the inaccuracy. There are errors related to conspiracy, physical errors, and psychological errors. The latter in particular are as crazy as the donkey's ass cheeks long inside those blue spandex. There are very vulgar lines and I will not begin to talk about some fun moves. There is absolutely no misconduct from anyone involved in this hot mess of a movie, except for one particular case. Jeffrey Lewis looks pathetic like Frank, a completely stupid figure. To tell the truth, I was really surprised to see that Van Dam had done a decent job playing the twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in the roles that were convincing to me. But the film was often very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a large film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
