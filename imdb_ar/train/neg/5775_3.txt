They are exposing this to some outside the network. It's a good crap. While it is not as bad as the B-movies that it displays on the Sci-fi network on Saturday it is still a fairly large pile. Acting is acceptable. The plot and writing are somewhat substandard and the pace is quite slow. Every minute of the film looks like part of the movie where they wrap things up before the credits - not the climax of the film, or the cancellation. Also, large parts of actors look old to the age group they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worth watching. Save your time. Not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.
