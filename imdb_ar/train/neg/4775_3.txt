What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a version of the Saw series, but with a worse representation. Melissa Joan Hart is very terrible. The end is silly and the story does not contain any distortions, not plot surprises, but just bad bad end. I loved some characters and I was hoping that everything would be linked together in the end. This just does not happen. She is a complete "wrestler" who ends up with a good acting. I can not believe I spent time watching this. This is not "fun" as some people have said. A man wearing a mask abducts related people and forces them to find out. The extended contact must shoot the main actress first.
