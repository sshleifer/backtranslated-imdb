Despite the overwhelming worship that followed this sad "documentary," I must admit that I hated the film that hit our party as a sad piece of exploitation rather than a useful one. Having said that, after watching the wonderful musical theater from which one can deduce, one can appreciate what the film might be in good hands. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that many of us who have been actively involved in the film may have any delights of its fans who have been ravaged by the uncomfortable doubts that many of us - or those we know - are just two or two mistakes away from the ordeal Deplorable of the two women who were portrayed in the painkillers and contributing to them, and apparently unable to control or escape. <br /> <br /> The film leaves the viewer wondering how anyone can slip into this level of degradation, unlike the musician, does not provide any evidence or explanation of caution, only show a great horror of humor or insight. <br /> <br /> This flattening flattening of the film makes the film theatrical version (hopefully eventually filmed for cable) is more impressive. Act II is faithful in almost every detail of the film under discussion, but it is strange that it raises the plight of sad prisoners of music, and raises the human tragedy of art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a good law first, where we meet women before their ordeal in a possible mutual madness, and hints are made about how an isolated disinfectant appears. In short, all that FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> Due to the credit of the filmmakers (or their successors), the excellent DVD version includes the draw and bonus material that partially retrieves the main film - behind scenes of photos, interviews and comments - filling some of the blank points that the original editing has decided to delete. His campaign for unbridled terror and depression. They can not make the amateur film itself satisfactory, but they can at least make it more comprehensive. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is ultimately a wonderful piece of play inspired by its author Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Corrie who raised the original GRAY GARDENS rating above a single song (gracious) star.
