First, I would like to say that this film deserves more than the four stars that I have rated. I gave it four stars because this 86-minute film always seems to me like two and a half hours and not enough to sit in it. However, the "Big Crocodile River" (which I call my DVD) is better than the natural film it presents. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening up and using indigenous people while trying to manipulate wildlife around. The "Mother Nature" that seeks revenge takes the form of the god Krona, the giant crocodile. But the creature is not the only thing that tourists and key characters (photographer and staff of the resort) should be concerned about, the original citizens also misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a beautiful adventure / horror story well done with a good musical score and direction. But the crocodile itself, the main attraction of the film, looks fake. Some close to her good jaw but this should be all we need to see. Some distant underwater shots make it painfully obvious that what we're really dealing with is a tough crocodile game you can probably get from a souvenir store in the zoo. But indigenous people are believable, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> A movie that will give you a nonstop thriller, if any, is probably not being filmed and produced well enough to be well mentioned. Like many creatures' movies, this film ends with too many body parts. It also has a lot of good jungle scenery. The representation is less than the name, but who would have expected it to be better, right? <br /> <br /> Much better than his recent US counterpart "Primeival" but nothing compares to "Jaws". But remember that you may not be engaging in a few points.
