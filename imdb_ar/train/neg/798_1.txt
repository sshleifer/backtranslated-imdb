Well, the film is good, but I give it one because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. This kind of crap adds only to those paranoid delusions of computer moron that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First of all, add strings of code and scores of 1 and 0 to the computer virus. The organic virus is more complex, although it is smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus molecule digs into your cells and binds itself to RNA, then changes your RNA code. Explain to me how such a thing can be handled from a device? Radiation may have some effect on the cornea of ​​the user that turns your carbons into these viruses? I can see that, but it is clear that the writer did not think about it.
