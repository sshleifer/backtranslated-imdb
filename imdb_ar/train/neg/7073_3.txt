We have a middle family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have a "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white child, the cute little child. We have a careless maid, what show has he had such maid? Do we have Brady Bunch messed up? Yay! When I first came out, I thought it was really wonderful, because I was young. The music was bad. The rap music was very bad and it was rated very well. All rap music had to do with his family, friends and problems. The father was a kind of Danny from Full House. He always gave her advice. But he was not a clean maniac. They had a house guard for it. remember? The plots were basically Romeo's night in trouble of some kind, or ... that's not all. Oh and maybe some Britten drama. Yes these things are good. Not right. But still good display for children. But Nickelodeon can do better.
