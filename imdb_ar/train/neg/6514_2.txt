The film tries to be sarcastic - filmed in the form of a documentary film but with many clearly written parts - but fails to provide the audience with any characters to create an illusion of clarity. The film is about finding true love in Los Angeles, but it is nothing more than an interesting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big film.
