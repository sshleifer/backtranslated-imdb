Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It looks as though someone has given a billion-dollar budget to a third-grade autism patient and said, "Make me a film about the secret service." The editing is ridiculous, the filming was random at best, every audio track of the dialogue was completely behind the director ... well, was there even a way out? Everything was meaningless, meaningless, meaningless ... random ... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here's a spoiler for you; this is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you will also enjoy; underworld, dark blue, and partial frontal lobe surgery.
