Hanna-Barbera absorbs life from another famous place. Violence is mitigated, equation stories, bad animations, hateful and repetitive music, and frankly, the show is not funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB placed each one of them in a series through the same vulgar positions, regardless of whether it suited the animation world or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recursive section such as Caves ("Hey! Popeye common, Flinstones are common, put them together and you can not fool them!"). Also, in a clear incursion into the "Soldier Benjamin", Olive Oil and John have a regular part that introduces them as new recruits in the army. seriously! why? <br /> <br /> Add to the inconvenience factor are public service announcements in each episode (standard practice at the time of the cartoons, but still annoying). Bob lectures his nephews to safely cross the street, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - The dangers of smoking! (I swear I do not). <br /> <br /> The only magic remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the early days, continues the role here. <br /> <br /> Worth checking once for a new estimate of the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
