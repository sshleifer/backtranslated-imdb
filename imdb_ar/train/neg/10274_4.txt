In Texas, seven friends meet in a pub to celebrate the night of Halloween before going to a party. In the meantime, they call the American Pirate Radio a nightmare for fun and acknowledge their deeper concerns. A serial killer, listens to their confessions, makes their nightmares a reality, and kills each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a weird, low-budget film with a startling start: Without a prior explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if on Friday, 13th. Then, the story moves to a pub, where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment on, the story has great potential, and anonymous actors perform very reasonably. They also exhibit some beautiful breasts and bare bodies, as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the scenario provides no explanation for the murder instinct and motives for the behavior of nurse Jane Tuban , Giving the impression that the budget was over before the shooting was completed. With a start and a better ending, this strange story will be a well-budgeted low-budget movie. My four vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
