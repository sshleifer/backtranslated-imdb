The spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, nothing really happened in this film, unlike a woman who bleeds inexplicably. Second, it was not scary. Third, he had the worst sound recording of any film ever. Let me explain. The sound was edited either bifis or buthide? I'm not sure, so let's go with Peeves. The movie gradually becomes calmer and people flounder and tumble, forcing you to raise the volume (I watched this at home). Then Beavis blows some sounds out loud with scary / shocking images assumed, causing you to lower the volume again quickly. This happens several times until the movie ends with good luck. I can imagine Bevis laughing from the rear of the two-way mirror while watching the test set reaching far afield each time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after sleeping, this is a big mistake. But then a big mistake anyway. Here's the idea ?? If you're making a horror film, add at least an undisclosed head, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming at the top of her lungs before she can take off her jacket, and her shadow on someone's wall being taken out of the camera directly, or A cat is thrown on the camera to frighten the audience, or some eccentric eccentric with a maniacal laugh, or a monster that looks like a theater hand covered with aluminum foil (Lost in Space). These people did not even try to hide me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
