I would be honest - the reason I hired this film was because I am a fan of Kyle Chandler (most notably the early release). Since he usually plays the role of good man, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The same plot has also attracted me; a professional assassin (Tony Greco - Mr. Chandler) must kill someone indiscriminately before he trusts in the life - or rather - the death of a witness testifying against someone in the "family". The movies were not as I expected. She was sick, she hated the end (if you saw her, you would know why), and there were a lot of unnecessary parts. Basically, it was dirty and did not make much sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes guns go BOOM. But there is more than a film. This film acted as though he did not have time to go into detail - just treat him and understand him. He was really acting, James Bellucci was very fond of the "rose". Cheryl Lee made Angel look as reasonable as you could get. She surprised me more. Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as a newcomer keen on "family." If the text only do justice to the actors.
