If someone wants to produce a really bad film, "Remedies for the Lost Kingdom" really sets a barometer for measuring the depth of distress. <br /> <br /> Start with the fake Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor hawks in a loose white "furry" look as if they were tucked together by ragged carpet pieces. Work your way slowly, and painfully, through more non-special effects that prevent the viewer from completely suspending infidelity. Add GNOME Garden (just to see it). <br /> <br /> In the second thought, skip this movie completely and look for something else to do for an hour and a half.
