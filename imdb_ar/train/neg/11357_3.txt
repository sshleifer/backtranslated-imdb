1st good news. The 3D has been accomplished beautifully, and they do not go into the tricks of your capture. The film is based on the true story of the most important point in the history of mankind, and even one of the real participants in this story is: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the flesh of the subject: It's about FLIES, for the crisks! He flies with great demagogic eyes, true, but he flies nonetheless. Do I remember when the "underworld" movies resembled rats versus cockroaches? It was not meant to be praise, and I never dreamed that anyone would literally take it. This one has less empathy to go for it. Baby Worms? Ugh. In one of those strange approximations of the collective Hollywood idea, this face was evident on the paintings at the same time as the "Space Chimpanzee", also about the creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go for the "Apollo 13" rental and see the Movie Rating 9 on Real Space Program (RIP).
