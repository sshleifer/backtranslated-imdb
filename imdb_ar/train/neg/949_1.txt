I never understood the appeal of this show. Impression is weak (Debra Jo Rupp represents a notable exception), conspiracies of most of the episodes are vulgar and uninviting, dialogue is weak, jokes are unfamiliar, and it is painful to try to sit up half a ring. In addition, the link between this show and the '70s' is too weak to go beyond the dress style, and the scene and background used in the show seem to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old, unfamiliar scripts that represent the modern theatrical sitcom. A show twenty years ago in the hope that some viewers will gain nostalgia or something like that. "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same style more effectively and I'm happy to see them in contrast to this pathetic excuse to show
