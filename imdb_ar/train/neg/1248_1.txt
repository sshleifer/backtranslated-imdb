This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. I've had some kind of new but again, not really. I was very disappointed with the tools Tim Burton has. He had a lot of makeup and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million). But can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was produced for less than $ 6 million? Heck no. In this regard, the film failed. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the Statue of Liberty was awful, but there was nothing horrific in this film until the end scene because you can see it coming somewhat. Incidentally, if you think about it, and did it, you can figure out how the end can end. I wish I had gone back from the time I wasted thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This was a great and fun film if it stayed like the first movie and was part of the "Down Planet" monkeys. "Here's how I would write it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut Supposed to be more than Marky Mark because it is not good enough to take care of a movie alone until I put three young people) will land on what they think is another planet, and face humans (not dumb), a city ruled by monkeys, hunted and made friends with some good monkeys , Discover that they are on the ground by finding some devastating effects, and end up colliding with the mutant madness of humans living underground, And then .... Well, let your imagination go the way you want it to end. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could have been a lot of this film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows How to destroy something good Look at what he did with the Batman series It 's a rotten outlet Despite people' s opinion It 's trendy So ​​it' s good to go Thinking Sorry but no If anyone else did this movie, it would have been much better and it would have been better Be more pleasing.
