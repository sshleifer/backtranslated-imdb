I was expecting much better than the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main chain. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for it to end. People talk a great deal about religion, computers, programming, punishment, etc. There are gangsters and mafia types who do beatings. However, Caprica does not have a procedure of the original string to compensate for the slow parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful tips when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of extravagant extravagance, you know the movie will be in vain. Caprica has a lot of this. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his weak abilities by throwing a few bare bodies. She never works, and all she does is neglect the very young actress concerned, and I feel sorry for them. Managers / writers who do this should be banned from working. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, you can hire Caprica by all means. There is (free) porn on the 'Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go ahead, nothing to see here.
