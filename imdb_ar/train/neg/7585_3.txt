I love watching the early color movies - you mean those 40s clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford controls this film. Her "eccentric" outfit is actually fairly catchy and yes, she has an amazing personality from the hourglass. But I feel she gave her head too much. She probably developed this description on many shows, and no one told her, "If you get a laugh, leave it out." They do a lot of deception when they are supposed to be on the ground suddenly. Madame Arqati's joke is that the media is usually portrayed as a volatile female in a long curtain. Arcati acts like a retired accountant (we will really put our backs in him!). The contrast between her familiar style and her strange beliefs does not really appear. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), Americans feel they should use the words "Bret", "Cruel", "Flange" and "Upper". Oh, give her a break! The three main characters constantly lose their anger and make offensive statements (did you love her? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the Cavalry!).
