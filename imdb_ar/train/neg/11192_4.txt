I was not quite impressed with this film. It was originally named Oen Eater and should have been kept that way given that this is all that was talked about in the last half of the film. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film were about any of the rest of it. He was very slow and was chosen with Robocop (Peter Wheeler) as one of the main actors. This was a sad point. <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to review this if you are dealing with Catholic religion but do not expect an exorcist or stigmatic of this film. You will definitely flop a few days later and come out on the floor.
