It was kind of enjoying this film so Ed Norton's facial hair issues. Without revealing any details of a plot of land - a light afternoon appeared on a light beard but in the evening itself, the beard had disappeared and a very luxuriant shawl. He was much more complete than the mustache who went with the beard. Later, during a dark night in the open, the mustache went and looked appropriate. This was an occasion where shaving was not an option. These differences in continuity distracted me completely from the rest of the film and destroyed any credibility I had enjoyed in the past. Also, I found that the long scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was very similar to De Niro in the taxi driver. Even if it was supposed to be a greeting that was placed on this scenes heavily.
