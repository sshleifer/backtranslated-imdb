This is the only film I've ever seen directed by Oy Paul, and I knew it was probably the worst director ever to make movies based on video games, and "The House of the Dead" is one of the lower IMDb movies 100. But I still want to watch it because I One of the fans of the game and I wanted to see what the film does, which makes it so bad. After watching it, I agree that it is nonsense, and the film did not have a story. In the first 15-20 minutes, there was nothing but naked teenage girls with no brains around (for a moment there I was wondering is the zombie dead? Or the girls?) Then at night, the zombie appeared out of nowhere and began attacking people later , A woman started shooting at them, I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy? , Or horror? Or both? Before I knew I was saved in the second half and woke up during the final credits so I could not see all of that, and that's good! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll Please do not make any other movies. thank you!
