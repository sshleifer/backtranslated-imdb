As far as the film goes, it is a good science fiction film. It contains lots of wonderful things, some quality sights. However, this is not good, some things are very nice ... <br /> <br /> As for the call this other cube movie is rude and complete! This is the definition of milking on a wonderful and original original film ... The whole sensation can be translated to some extent to the first essence, but the introduction of / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is somewhat stretch ... <br /> < This was given 3 *** because of the original appeal. This sterilizer should have been kept in many parts of the film so that there is no place or time to mention it all. <br /> <br /> Wathable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but are not recommended for series fans ...
