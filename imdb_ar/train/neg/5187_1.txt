I will not take up and criticize RAW theories. I mean, this is a site about films and whether the film delivers or is well made, not the philosophy of discussing the site. <br /> <br /> After saying this, this video really explodes. It's one shot to talk about RAW after another. Some of these clips are archival videos, so you can see how old they are over the years, and that's great. But, otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's an odd comparison, but I kept thinking about Sunday afternoon when I saw some Barbra Streisand stars with a * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After a while, I was working at Barbara, I kept hoping there was one scene that did not appear: As you know, "other characters in the film were living up to something else ..." moment. But it was all about Barbara. Well this video is * funny lady *. <br /> <br /> If, then, your idea of ​​having a good time is to look at the different shapes of the corners of the RAW face as it wiggles along with its theories, grouped into a lame structure that adds no interest or insight, then is my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
