This film looked good - a wonderful team, an evergreen theme and an explosive opening. I went down from there. Why was it photographed by hand by camera? Shakes, rulers, part captures scenes and causes scenes simply. Actually poor choice. As if this was not enough, the worst modification in memory presupposes an anesthetized viewer - mandatory if you want to have any fun at all. Then he commits the worst sin ever. After the viewer turns down all kinds of scenarios that are not possible and unreasonable to the point of exhaustion, they pay the credits without disclosing the cancellation - the end - the return - contrary to what was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making excitement without end? Doh! This film has achieved a great promise and ends up in the face of the mud plant. What a waste of effort. A weak effort for the writer and director.
