The film begins with people on Earth who discover that their rocket to Mars has not been lost but was drifting in space near the planet. When they are recovered, one of the crew members is ill, the other is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is informed by the reaction of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew were apparently attacked by a whole host of very mysterious monsters. Strangely enough, although the collections were good, the monsters were among the nicest I saw in the film. In addition, in a quaint attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation made the film look very cheap when it was on Mars and the intensity of the redness made my eyes bleed practically - it was bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had an interesting plot along with a good message about traveling to space. For lovers of this genre, it is worth watching. For others, you may find the whole thing ridiculous - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> While this film is not according to today's standards particularly well, compared to the films that are produced at that time, it accumulates well. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, pay careful attention to Dr. Tremaine. It's like Dr. Quest's spitting image of Johnny Quest! In addition, he seems to be behaving like him too.
