I simply can not believe the number of people who compare this favorably with the first film. You made me leave this comment! This is just a clear attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film. The dialogue is shocking and does not look as authentic or persuasive as the original film. <br /> <br /> The story of irony, the French police filming of laughter and the characterization of Doyle a mile from the first film. <br /> <br /> How many narcotics chiefs do you think are going down to a sidewalk in person to see a shipment enter? The ease with which Doyle finds his leg is pathetic. Like all the French police, she drank coffee only until Doyle came from America and did a real police job. What a joke. Try going to a foreign city and discover the largest crowds in the place with a travel map and some tourist publications. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really horrific sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
