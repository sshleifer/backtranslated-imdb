I just bought VHS in this film versus two, you wasted my money! Hey, dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third-class production is a rework of dozens of other biker movies. A handful of psycho-ridden drivers go to Hick's town, beat everyone and everything, then they defeated the man at the hands of a broken champion. Adam West looks at the role of the hero, but lacks the head and Batman. Sorry, not only is the same. Tina El seems to be tense and scared of the whole show, but at least we know what happened to Ginger as soon as she was rescued from the island ... LOL! The drivers are a heterogeneous group, and are known to have acted again or at least should not be. Hell riders is hell to watch!
