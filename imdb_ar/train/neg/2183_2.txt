This film was really bad, whether you imagine it as a science fiction film or a horror film or a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and is not too expensive), the actors have no idea what representation and scenario clearly shows that it was made with photography. Obviously the monster was added in the closet because the head of the neighborhood was not scary at all - it was beautiful - they thought they needed something more impressive; they also failed here (make-up is terrible until the late 1950s, which is somewhat funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the life of director Joseph Green did not materialize as a book and also as a writer. It was really bad in both. The same applies to actors, leadership and support. <br /> <br /> "The best in the game" "The best performance of the brain" is its short time.
