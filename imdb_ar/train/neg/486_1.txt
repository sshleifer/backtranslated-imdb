This flick was a blow to me. I think young girls should be tempted to be more than fashion models, home makers or mistresses, which seems to be all that will be filmed anyway. It is truly sad to see the work of the artist and his life unfairly misunderstood. It is unacceptable (or perhaps expected) that the whole artemisia personality and everything that it represents has turned into Hollywood, female. A physically wretched little creature that is flawless, does not exhibit any of the personality traits that have already brought it to this place in the history that has been distorted here. It is sad to see that a large part of the audience received a very bad education in the region to understand the amazing gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. To portray the artist as someone who loves her rapist in real life, a person who actually accused him of raping her even when she was under torture, only annoyed me. If the director had nothing more fundamental to say that she should not give her story to a real person.
