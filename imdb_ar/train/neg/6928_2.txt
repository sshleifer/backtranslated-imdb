All the other comments already said what I'd say, here goes anyway. I think this was Italian at first, so sorry, Italy. I was not bored because I was waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tar and Professor Feather on their way back? Was Alan Parsons? I saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected, terrible. Filled with strips and stuff. The film was an incoherent mess. Music idiot and ignorant characters. The main person must have known in the first minute that the doctor was more unusual than the patients. I thought that the "doctor" who directs the scene of the "battle" will never end. Some kids were good looking though. These stupid ass movies seem to always aim at a nude girl or two and this makes you addicted to drugs. I gave him 2 to the nekkid women. This bird dance made me want to pull my glasses. Bo may have taken about 3,000 rpm in his grave when this thing appeared because it was based on his story.
