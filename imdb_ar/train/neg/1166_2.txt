After I saw an interview previously I had great hopes alive. The film's description appeared on the back of the promising DVD jacket. Alive did not deliver. Development is very slow. Lots of potential with great staff and visuals. The hypothesis was interesting but the return did not meet the increase. It can do much more in the end. Most of the film is just "sitting". Frankly, three of us were sitting watching this movie and watching it and by 50 minutes we were struggling to make it reach the end. It really needs more shock elements. If you're looking for battles like Ichi the Killer or Versus, save yourself some dollars and a lot of disappointment.
