The Dane tries to be very harsh with all his shouts and madness, and pours water on himself and runs on the ground. too much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I did not fully understand the comparison between comedy and rock stars. Just because there are both on stage or something? He said that every comedian wanted to be a rock star. I'm sure that Rodney Dangerfield was in fact when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell while driving. I also love Reese Jokes piece. If the dane does not act so mentally, it may be funnier and given a higher rating, possibly up to eight.
