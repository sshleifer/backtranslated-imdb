The title of the worst movie of all time is the movie that is distributed quickly and repeatedly most of the time is really exaggerated, but I would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of the real candidates: Plan 9 of Outer Space, Betfield Field, and Pluto Nash Adventures. <br /> <br /> When I saw the 90-minute cavity, I found it hard to stay awake even while trying to laugh hard at the film. But unfortunately I felt lonely in the dark (I would try to avoid the pun but I could not resist) I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robots. Unfortunately, I had to make a comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about motion and effects because that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil objects that represent a cross between Xenos in aliens (called Xenos) and objects in Pitch Black. It can turn invisible at random (and assure you it is random) and is hurt by light. There are also small centipede creatures used to control humans turning them into zombies. All these images are exhibited with special old influences that may have been modest in 1997. The scenes of the movement are chaotic and impossible to follow. People randomly shoot a blue screen or an empty set on the monsters that have been inserted into the publication. The light shines quickly on a dark screen, making your pupils burn from overwork while the bad rock music glows in the background. <br /> <br /> Those were important points. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea is based strictly on wearing the black bat's wife with a trench coat and not a razor for two days. Archaeologist (Reid) who is somewhat incompetent. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines include a barking order. The three must feel embarrassed by their performance (not that they have done a good job before) and that the director of the cast has come out. Reed and Slater are supposed to be fans of the film. The film contains the most embarrassing scene of love I have seen in the film between the two. <br /> <br /> Then the plot comes. Honestly honest the stale parts are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes can contain the collective vanity of all three stars. The film begins with a text and a voice explaining the background story. This opening lasts for more than a minute and the viewer already knows that he is in something terrible. This opening narrative is later reproduced adnausem in an awkward dialogue in a clumsy and very heavy way through the rest of the film. The end was not logical. It was not only logical in the film world, but it simply did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally one direction of Uwe Boll. Shame, that's all you can say. His use of shaking the camera to simulate the thrill. Lack of guidance with actors. Only Reed watched the scenes that were not the focus of the shot. A complete waste of money Special effects of the effects of the time of the bullet. Finally, I choose to use the sound to explain something that must be painfully clear to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to watch this show in a second theater. While making me laugh and our friends deserve every quarter, I advise people to avoid paying more for this film. Get 3 friends split the cost of rent and rip this movie to a new movie. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reed. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you Stephen Dorf. Shame on anyone associated with this movie.
