Good grief! While I continue to stress that Manos: the hands of fate are the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins approached awfully. This ... this ... offends the public at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least you can enjoy movies like Space Mutiny and Future War on mst3k, this movie was a struggle to reach it. I was literally writhing on the couch in pain. This thing succeeded in embarrassing me - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a fan of fanatic MST3K and have made your task to see each individual experience, think twice about seeing this experience. <br /> <br /> It's bad.
