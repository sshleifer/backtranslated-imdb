Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she is connected to Bruce), the killer of the first film, returns to her old tricks again. She is a consultant at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and away from sex, the drugs and things that lead to the oath are fine. But a few steps away, Angela kills them - cracking bad jokes along the way. <br /> <br /> The original Sleepaway Camp was a wildly graceful film but had some good points. This is evil and very bad but has no good points for it. This plot was executed to death and this adds something new to the formula. There are a lot of vicious killings here (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, throat), but it is clear that all these gowns are so fake that they have become a comedy. This also contains the smallest number of campers I have ever seen, and almost everyone is very far from their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is an unexplained female nudity (presented here by the highly under-privileged Valerie Hartmann) and the team of the good girl (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With a single exception to Springsteen and Higgins, the acting would be lousy - even by the standards of bright films. There is also a harsh feature of this film where one character sank into an outside building! Boring and satisfying with a stupid plot, useless nudity and bad gore. skip it.
