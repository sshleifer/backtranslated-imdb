If the writer / director reads this (and I imagine that you should now be unemployed) then I must tell you - I have seen some bad films in my time but this film distinguishes the possession of the worst hypothesis I have heard before. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happened! <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time. I laughed out loud in the end. <br /> <br /> Side note - (if the entire movie was in a coma, does the scene you sleep with this guy mean someone raped her while tossing it?) <br /> <br /> The garbage runs out.
