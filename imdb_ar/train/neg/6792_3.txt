Here's a movie with a great team and a nice location, but it does not have it. Director Richard Brooks must be a little tired at this stage of the game; how much better was his professionals! It seems that the horses and the rest of the movement in motion are slow even during the motionless motion scenes. This film needs to be accelerated, if any. This little horse seemed a terrible lie to me and the clear tire paths in these desert tracking moments - lazy. bungle. so sad. The actors did well, but I certainly saw them all doing a better job. Ben John is always a delight, though. I saw this for the first time in almost 30 years; I was disappointed at the time and remained at the second scene in 30 years.
