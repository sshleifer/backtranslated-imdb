How was Greenwich's birthday stealing a wonderful Christmas cartoon that anyone can easily enjoy, I have not seen a reason to renew. Not to mention the remake made to humans, the drawings were perfectly perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But it seemed a bit odd for Jim Carrey to be a Greenwich. I mean it's a fantastic comedian actor, but his greensh? It just did not make any sense to me. His performance was slightly higher and he laughed unintentionally in moments. Not to mention that some of the added dialog boxes were a bit childish and not fun. The full story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who ended and were not required. They actually destroyed the story, this period. <br /> <br /> All the people in Whoville are preparing for their best Christmas season, where everything is meant to be perfect. But Cindy Lo is curious and worried about Greenwich who lives above them and that he will not enjoy Christmas like the other he is. He expels her and decides he does not want Christmas this year and that he really has to steal Christmas together to show who is talking about his Christmas story. But soon realized that he might know it was a little more than the physical version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Greenwich Stall Christmas was not required and was not a little higher. I really recommend that you stick to animation just for the simple fact that this version is very annoying, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the entire film was completed, not to mention how Christmas Grinch stole! It was supposed to be cartoon rather than Jim Carrey. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Karloff which runs every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
