I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more work, and a more objective and consistent picture. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romance, it's just boredom itself. I find the actors are also working poorly. O'Donnell may look as charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture lacks any charm. Maybe when he grows up, he loses his childish charm but does not acquire any charm from the adult. Not surprisingly, it has not been shown in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and not released in the Netherlands.
