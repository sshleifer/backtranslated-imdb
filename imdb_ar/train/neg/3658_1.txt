Despite some mildly thought-provoking abnormalities in the script and the overall value of the curiosity of the film, Fury of the Wolfman stands out in an uninteresting tedious journey to the Lacantophe, where it is saved only by the presence of statues of Perla Cristal. The remainder of the players, including Hamch Naschy, is a complete write-off (although it is recognized that none of them were assisted by the terrible dubbing often). Although the screenplay has enough on the Wolf / Frankenstein / Dr. Morrow subjects to highlight more than a dozen films, the plot has been unevenly developed, the descriptions are too weak and the dialogue is very ridiculous (at least in the English version) The underlying interest in harsh measures was soon extinguished. <br /> <br /> Zapalza's direction seems to be jerky, so he is amateur. Its launch is clumsy and ineffective. It does not help him brightly illuminate. Even promising groups are filmed in an atmosphere so unusual that the few attempts of the director to give the audience a fear that is mentioned in advance long ago <br /> <br /> There are other credits in a similar pattern of uncertainty, although the most amazing result of music The primordial, full and primitive influences are particularly deserving of condemnation.
