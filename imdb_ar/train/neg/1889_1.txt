This film is not entertainment in any way but more than a profound look at the deepest side of the darkest human behavior. Incorrectly links half a dozen stories of the worst types of corruption, perverse sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All events are carried out over a very hot and sticky few days during a hot spell in Vienna, and heat may be responsible for some of the anger and hatred in the film. For me, the girl's backward treatment was treated by the security hardware vendor about the worst episode, followed closely by scenes of sugar and corruption in the "slag" apartment. I will sweep and wish this movie. I hated it but I felt I had to see it. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 to view "man" as it is sometimes.
