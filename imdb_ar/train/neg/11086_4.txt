As far as the Western Spaghetti goes, this man has developed can not die on the drab side of this kind. It's not that the film is particularly bad, but it lacks the sparkle of some of the other bands I've seen. Guy Madison is doing his best in the lead role, but lacks the charisma on screen to pull it. With one notable exception, the rest of the crew is not particularly good. The trend is uninspiring and provides very few moments I have not seen before. There is not much to excite his enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The cast of representatives you mention is Rosalba Neri. It is the only bright spot in this modest film. Unfortunately, its screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. Rosalba Neri does not play the role of Jenny Benson, but is the character of Melanie.I am not sure how anyone can make a mistake by Rosalpa Neri to someone named John Barthe Basem listed in the "Impossible Man" IMDb credits for the movie.)
