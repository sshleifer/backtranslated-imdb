The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman's "Dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​aerosol spraying "Vapoorize" which when sprayed on dog droppings, makes the stool disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping Vapoorize would be a real product so I could spray it on this "stinking" film and make it disappear into the thin air as well. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst film I have seen in the past 12 months (this honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), it has the privilege of getting a second chance. <br /> <br /> Not funny, not sad, not anything. Real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
