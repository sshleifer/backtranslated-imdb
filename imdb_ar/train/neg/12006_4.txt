Well, the director actually returns your love. Director Nikhil Advani after appearing for the first time with KHNH in the second half and waiting <br /> <br /> He makes a 3:30 hour film + loses his patience and time. Looks like 3 hours of sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> Well, they had 6 stories, so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi convincing but boring TV series do not show these stories? <br /> <br /> We have the funny story of Govinda-Shannon and it works well <br /> <br /> We have Akshaye-Ayesha's story again believable but soon bored and focus on the more comedic comedy which is boring Too <br /> <br /> We have the story of Salman-Priyanka the worst terms, not just acting, it makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> We have Sohail- Isha story to make you laugh and sometimes work with the boredom you put Most of the other stories <br /> <br /> Our story John-Vidya has a good story in all respects <br /> <br /> But by the time all the stories come in small parts, the viewer is bored and sleepy. Especially the climax of the story of Salman - Priyanka Nikhil Advani is treated well in some places, some stories are treated well but weak in good music places (SEL), but a lot of good cinematic songs, each story is presented a different look, <br /> <br /> The actors Govinda are bragging, after returning from working with BB, making you laugh and love in this film. Despite his age and weight, Anil Kapoor plays his role well. He looks out of shape and outperforms John in part. Akshay Khana On the change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too much - Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is the chapter <br /> <br /> Priyanka Walla N deserve the award for this film, which shocked? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is not just acting, just talking like he is sleeping, and a false tone, God Priyanka, is overly concerned with such a standard that you feel like throwing something at her. She gets better at the end, Vidya Balan is good, and Juhay Chawla Shannon okay is fine
