Hey come on, <br /> <br /> Well, this film really sucks. I think "love actually" in the opposite direction. Nothing suits you perfectly, nothing coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> It's a total mess. As shown, however, there are three points of substitution around this cross-cutting possibility of a film. <br /> <br /> A) With a star bill for Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of men who will be offered a grace to watch this just to catch the small Hewitt with appropriate clothing for the model. To tell you now guys .... there are some promising scenes .... but they are already weak eye candy. The "probabilities" are mitigated here. However, I have seen everything seductive about the next scene of you and he knows what ..... tickle! <br /> <br /> B) The end is romantic and positive. It's the opposite and "above the top" is appropriate ... but for me it still represents a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dugray Scott plays the role of a friendly man ........ refreshing! Thank you so much! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worth $ 10 or so. <br /> <br /> 2/3 Of the way, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next legend. Although I'm going to get this back for the moment ... but it depends heavily on her next film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister is stupid. Her husband is stupid ... and heck, she's stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. Can not wait for the next love actually with JLH!
