I saw omen when I was 11 on TV. I enjoyed the trilogy. So when I had the chance to finally see someone in the cinema, I did not miss her. I went to the cinema knowing that what I was about to see was not a movie version, but he made a television movie. However being a fan I could not resist. But this film Omen that I saw in the midnight show did not bring the chills brought laughter. A reasonable dialogue such as "It is written that if the child cries during baptism, they reject God there." What is this nonsense. No decent package pieces. Faye Grant so Good in V is lost with this script of hell. No surprises and no fun. Yet she laughed loudly several times at our bad. It was pathetic
