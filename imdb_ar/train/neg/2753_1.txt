First I would like to point out that Sam Neil is nowhere to be seen in this film. What is a movie without Sam Neal? Does anyone see the event horizon. D-Wars had a potential movie about a dragon controlling lizards using rocket launchers, looks great but unfortunately not. No, no Sam Neil, no good film. I recommend taking $ 5 or so to rent a D-Wars and add 10 to five and buy a movie. Sam Niel - To make this appear, I must have ten lines of text to broadcast a list of Sam Niel movies I recommend <br /> <br /> - Jurassic Park - Very quiet - Search for the Red October - The horizon - Not the three Jurassic Garden <br /> <br /> Generally D-Wars is a pile
