Awwww .... Yes, it is sad and everything the family of ABC / Sears adopted was unlucky, and their house was renovated. Where the humanitarian appeal ends. I liked him early in his term, but now this offer has become excessively disgusting. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families can be given relatively luxuriant homes with lots of good things for every single family featured in each episode of this show. People in the habitat for humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a 16-year-old boy to have a Jacuzzi in his bedroom, or have his bed befilled with Low Rider? Does the mother really need her old, shabby, non-functioning and rusty truck that has been restored and her "strengths" by some of California's best designers? A new job would have done the job well, perhaps a third of the price. Do people really need a 65-inch plasma screen in every room at home? Then there is the question of who pays increasing property taxes and utility bills. Even after leaving Scania in the "Makeover", there is still someone earning his living. I suspect that the friendly people at Social Services will see humor in all this zeal. <br /> <br /> This offer is nothing more than a pick-up for ABC's ratings, and an implicit commercial ad for its sponsors.
