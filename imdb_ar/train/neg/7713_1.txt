I knew that this film was supposed to be so bad and it was fun, so I entered it with this expectation. I found it very bad, it was deadly boring. The song with its wonderful features is funny for about 10 seconds, so realize that there is nothing intelligent about it except in its deliberately disturbing quality. Seeing things scatter with tomatoes become old in about 30 seconds. There is nothing clever or funny about the film except the hypothesis. It can keep a comic sketch of 3-4 minutes, but this is not just a feature film in any fantasy.
