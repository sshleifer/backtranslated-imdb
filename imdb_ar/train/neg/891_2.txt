After I loved "Paris, Je T'aime", I was expecting this film very much and I admit I went with great expectations, but I was very disappointed for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect to remake Paris in New York I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about "Paris" was the disintegration of neighborhoods. You have a sense of the style of each director and the story they wish to narrate. In New York, there is no clear separation of stories. At different points in the film, characters from different stories intersect with each other, making me puzzled by what I was watching and what was happening. Also, the switch in the output was clear but confusing because there was no flow. <br /> <br /> There's something else I liked about "Paris" - the difference of love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, love without pay, a single middle-aged woman yearning for love, etc., and I have explored many layers of love complexity between people. "NY" seemed like a very sexy activity. There were some recoverable short films (the older couple spent a lifetime together, short Julie Christie), but the film "NY" in general did not raise any feelings for me. I did not communicate with any of the characters as I did with "Paris". I remember seeing "Paris" and the feeling of deep sadness, loneliness, hope, hope and wonder ... There was a lot of soul. To me, there was no spirit in the movie "New York." <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I had entered it without looming "Paris" in my mind as a comparison this film may have triggered a more favorable response, but as the title "Paris, Je T'aime", I was disappointed Severe.
