Perhaps this is the most boring film in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this film given to the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd better see the three Amigos than ever before to watch this movie again. He immediately went from the DVD player directly into the trash. My apologies to those of you who seem to like this movie but you probably also liked the new Coca-Cola. I am puzzled to find out why anyone enjoys this film, it is slow and boring and has no real conspiracy. Wait for 105 minutes to start the movie. I understand that this was done in 1976 but this was a bad TV era everywhere. Praise be to God Disco and three company have gone along with stop signs of glasses and the Bay of Rolls City. Well just okay my thoughts.
