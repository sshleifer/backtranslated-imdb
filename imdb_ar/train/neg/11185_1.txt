Yes, there is already an MTV channel to market Daria. What began as a smart teenager - "a comment on everything you absorb and make the viewer feel better about their busy teen life" has now turned the sitcom into "how to deal with your problems". I watched Darya all the time and loved her. Now, after you're sitting here after watching the so-called "movie", I can not help but wonder about the purpose of all this. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Excuse me? Did not Daria mention in every episode that what you want to do is good, as long as it is okay with yourself no matter what the rest of the sad sad world thinks? This reminded me of the "Reality Bites" scene, which features the first feature documentary film channel.
