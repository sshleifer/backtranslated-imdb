As a true Elvis fan, this film is a complete embarrassment and the text is a disaster. The movie begins with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and gives the Grand Canyon scenery to the viewer hope for something special. Elvis gets in the picture and loses his talent a great time, especially in the rest of the distinctive songs. I sat through this movie twice, just to make sure it was a piece of rubbish !!! 1 out of 10!
