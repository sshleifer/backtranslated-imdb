One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was so bored that I switched him off halfway to watch the news. When you turn it back on, you're asleep. The film begins with a dream and continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are a few dreams between. Come on, what's supposed to keep me interested? The film needs to have a reason to pay attention. The moment I felt that the film was just a dream, anyone who is sane is turned off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling their dreams and what does that mean for them? This is! Very awful.
