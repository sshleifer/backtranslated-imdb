Although I am not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in credits at the opening of Joshua. Heck, I did not realize he was in "Joshua" until the movie started. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie based on the film, not the thread. Bills have been issued for "Rosemary's Baby", "The Omen", or any other "Joshua" baby movie. Unfortunately, flat fell. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. However, I continued to see how all this would be resolved, hoping beyond belief, the climax of the end would shed some light on the subject. Well, I admit, I did (a little per week) but what a senseless closure. Its a low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. Someone falling ?? You do not see the landing, you see someone lying in what seems to be blood. A person gets a taxi? You do not see it, you see someone complain and catch a bike. I'm not sure if this is called "method" or laziness or simply lack funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, an addicted father trying to balance everything, baby ?? Joshua, who may / may not be the Antichrist and a new baby girl weeps so much. Crying as far as we see the number of days she was alive ?? And what was that? Are there mice above or are they Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua insane? Is he just jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will it grow to be Michael Myers? Or is he leading his family to the edge of the abyss? I do not think so. They have been nuts before, and no "so-called" can make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, hardly any questions were answered, the doors were barely closed. I'm sure it might have been the idea, but for a house, give me something. Any thing. There are plenty of movies for kids to explore. Joshua is like Minnie Me of the Antichrist.
