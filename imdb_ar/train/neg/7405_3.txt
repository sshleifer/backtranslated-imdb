I think they really claim quality DVD production far from them. I rented this DVD from two movie stores, and the second time I got it to play on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is really hard to give the film an unbiased assessment after passing through such trouble to run it. For one, I have never seen a Finnish horror film before, so I was concerned that the film was done in English. Also, since Sara's mistake was never made clear, I just got out of the retarded, so I really hoped somebody would let her out and make all the horrible events disappear.
