On a very rare occasion only, a loop of x files fails to generate any excitement or does the loop contain anything completely boring to watch. A detective and his former partner die in unexplained circumstances. Deaths are related to the presence of a young girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Mulder invented the theory that a man killed by his colleagues returned to his body as a small girl and avenged. It is produced by the small girl. There is no connection at all, and it seems to be just a random person chosen as a reincarnation. I think this was a rather lazy book by the book, and this episode is classified as one of the worst in the history of x files!
