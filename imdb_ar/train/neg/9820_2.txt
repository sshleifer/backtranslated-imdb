I'm happy because some people liked this, but I hated this movie. She had a very good idea about the story, but this is where it ended up. It was badly written, behaved poorly, and was poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting plot points, but they were skipped very quickly, and the writers had to understand what they should keep and expand, such as lying about why they were kidnapped, and getting rid of the slag. Instead, it was "What's going on?" , After 5 seconds they tell you. <br /> <br /> The film had no suspense, and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted to finish. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery, or better plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing until the end.
