Well, the story is meaningless, the characters lack any dimensions, the best dialogue is the ads about the low quality of the film, the filming is bad, the editing only saves a little bit of confusion, but Sam "Bikinba" took the film one way or another, its direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his wonderful work, this film is a disappointment. Even the wonderful crew can not recover the time the viewer is wasting with minimal effort. <br /> <br /> The appropriate response to the film is the disdain of director San Pekingba, James Kane, Robert Duvall, Bert Young, Bob Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Jeig Young, to their work, watching the great films of Beckenba.
