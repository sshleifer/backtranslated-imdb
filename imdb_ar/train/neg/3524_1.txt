This is one of the worst cases in a long time. It's so terrible that I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for the "malignant" because it offers a decent performance on its part. But this plot ... my dear my dear. I particularly like the road near the end run by the pop from the foot of the mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on the way. Climb a day or two takes it every five minutes! I can continue: but this is not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which until five years old will be able to predict the outcome), the rest is an engine. Sorry people, but this is as bad as filmmaking gets.
