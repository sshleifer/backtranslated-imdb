Hey fun! O joy! Another very bad film is good! Or so I thought. In fact, this stage lacks a "very bad" phase, and unfortunately goes directly to "it could have been very bad, but they proved it and made it bad." <br /> <br /> To start her way for a long time. Cutting half an hour was probably more bearable. Then put ridiculous plots such as "the man who sabotages the task of saving the earth, because he has all the food stored and will become rich if the mission fails!". Doh! Or a "bomb talk" device that was last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... just like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add "we can not get out of kindergarten" and you are suffering from the solar crisis in short. <br /> <br /> Light relief must be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Bants, as we called it in this click), whose sole purpose in the film is to lead a child around the desert and phone the child's father to take him. End. Between command and telephone, Jack Dreifle distributes meaningless and raises a lot of burdens, but he contributes little to the story, as it is. In short, it is the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> The "Most Ironic Line Delieded Direct-Face Face" award went to Charlton Heston, who, when he met his eldest son for the first time in ages, indicated that his son seemed to be "out of shape" There with the bulge of his bowels on his waist and in desperate need of Captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is also enjoying the best cleric, who has a bright white hairstyle that made me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from this hilarious, there is nothing recommended for this film. The end is a sequence copied from (but shorter than) the end sequence of 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie more, if you are stupid enough to watch it, as you did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever you talk about the bomb, imagine it is called Tarquin. When Chuck Heston is on the screen and about to talk, keep it by reading a line from Planet of the Apes like "get dirty enough about me!" Or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Every time the female looks tense (this is most of the time), she continues to hope against hope that she will suffer from an aneurysm and will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. During the never-ending "Ship Again Crash" scenes, he continued to hope that men in technology / engineers would unleash the Scotty era like "You can change the laws of physics!" Or some of these wastes. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do what you need to alert you to this. I wandered halfway up and woke up to realize that I had missed nothing, and made no plot (funny though it was). So do not worry about tuning a few, you will not miss anything.
