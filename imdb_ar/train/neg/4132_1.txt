The advantage of the early 21st century of cinema allows the pit of various evil creatures and villains against each other. We have not seen such things since Godzilla against King Kong and the like. Always look great on paper when you are in a blur of good things that have an inspiring idea and you see everyone playing before you love Beethoven symphonies. Then I came to write it down. Great ideas like all female vampires. Ego is spicy, deadly deadly but in a way I want to destroy some kind of road. All zombies are men. Well, what do men like to a woman after throwing a shisse or fooling her right? So everything looks really good. Then start the mold to set. Most of them fought. Nothing happens so much. Another battle. Philosophical poetic and cod wallop. Eureka we found how to win. Big fight back and end. Sounds great is not it? If it's an independent company, that would be great. But this is Hollywood with an eye on dollars: gloss rather than what fans want. Every gore could have been soaked up pretty.
