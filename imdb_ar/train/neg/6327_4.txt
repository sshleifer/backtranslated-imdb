I think this movie would be much better then it was. It seemed like a parody of the spy generation, and I was reminded of Pleasantville, but it was short. <br /> <br /> The plot is just silly. Both the KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia began a spy school to teach their spies how to behave like Americans, but the city they set up for training is a bit old, so they took Yank from the United States to stuff things over. I do not know, but it just seems to me. It seems very strange when no one in this Russian town speaks in Russian. Prove someone on the acting assignment. <br /> <br /> Also, for a very dry comedy. There are one, two funny tops, and they have nothing to sing and dance about. The movie will eventually make you sleep. <br /> <br /> Because it is a twisted pile in the face, this film is very supportive of the United States, making me feel sick. The film continues to say time and again, that the United States is God, Russia is the devil. This is the kind of defamation campaign waged against the Japanese in World War II. They are films like this that make everyone think that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gets 4 out of 10, and I'm nice. You are supposed to get a great view, but the dance scene was fun, but again it stretched for a long time to become really funny.
