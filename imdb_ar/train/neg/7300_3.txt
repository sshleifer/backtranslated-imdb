This film revolves around a group of five friends who rented a cabin in the forest. A friend gets a terrifying virus that eats meat. Suddenly, friends run each other in a desperate attempt to prevent the disease themselves. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a terrible movie. For one, it tries to have many species at once. Is it supposed to be a tribute or a metaphor or a black comedy or a scary film with an unintended comedy? No one can say. There is a dangerous scene at the beginning and the second, turns into funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor will be very nice, except the ending. I loved the end a lot. <br /> <br /> But apart from the end, I was very disappointed and disgusted. Violence is worth crawling, seen far from the screen rather than scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes very random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in a slu movement. What are we supposed to get from it? This same girl bites one of the characters. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were good, and many were amateur. I did not care about most of the characters. I loved the plot but it was awful implementation. As a horror film, I did not know what he was trying to be. I did not find her funny, tense or scary. In the end, I left indifferent, thinking, "What have you just passed?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
