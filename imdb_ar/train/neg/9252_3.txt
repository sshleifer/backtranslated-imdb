But the actress, who plays only her daughter, is not credible. <br /> <br /> This does not work well for me when I see a 25-year-old actress playing a role for 12 years since age ... other commentators suggested that this is one of the messages of this film, Sometimes more like adults than adults, but with this movie as in this movie, it does not work for me. <br /> <br /> You may want to check other comments to see what this movie is really about, because I could not bear to see it until the end. <br /> <br /> I agree with that the premise of this film is beautiful though - I hope another director tries to capture this story again.
