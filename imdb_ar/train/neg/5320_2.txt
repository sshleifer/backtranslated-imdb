This is a dry and sterile feature that depicts one of the most interesting events in World War II and in the history of war behind the front line. The formation of bad drama is the worst in this film, where the plot to kill Hitler is supposed to be a very exciting event. There is no evolution in personality at all, and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play the role of a high-level leader questioning his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I think Mister Ben will play it better. In general, the film looks pretty much like a copy of a good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but this film can not be approached in relation to any aspect of the film. However, it is clear that the film gets its financial goal with a pop audience that boasts Hollywood blood of quick temper and shallow artistic values.
