It was a good story, but not good. I liked the themes and the main storyline, which was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was a lot going on, and the lack of ability to restrain everything. The acting was fine for cheeses, some were stronger than others, and even the most powerful actors enjoyed moments of good acting. It took me two months to get to the entire film because it did not catch my attention and the flow was very bad. I just finished watching it and I'm glad I did it because the film is finally moving and has some continuity in the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was substandard. I recommend it to the story line and maybe a small eye candy, I mean a little bit.
