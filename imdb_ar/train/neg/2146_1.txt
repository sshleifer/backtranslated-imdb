I'll put it here here, and that was the worst thing in the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney issued a tribute to him as one of his greatest films of all time. Now, take the wonderful songs, add a bad plan that looks like a missing TV show. "Put it together and what do you get?" The biggest load of Crud I have ever seen. After seeing this, I thought it was over for Disney. Cinderella had to end up with "and lived happily ever after". Not this garbage. This movie is not worth a sequel like this. I thought it would be like a "timely development" that was mild but better than this. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? I changed aspects like Iago, but did not help anyone.
