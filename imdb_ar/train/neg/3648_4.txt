A couple without children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Heinga) go to a doctor (James Karen) for a pregnancy attempt. It's a success, but Adams slowly realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the child ... <br /> <br /> A very beautiful and exciting idea is made through a lousy script - the basic idea is fine but predictable screaming towards the end . I saw every "twist" coming. The trend is weak - it seems he has no idea how to photograph a basic scene. Production values ​​- to be nice - poor. Too shabby. The prevailing scenes are very unpleasant (closed when a pregnant woman stabs herself in the stomach) with particularly poor effects. The film is completely derailed in the end when it becomes clear that he has no idea how to end the film. <br /> <br /> Some good behaviors make it somewhat likely. Adams and Heinga and Karen Goodon are all in their roles and keep watching me but it was about that. This film was barely released in 1991 and is still unknown - it is easy to find out why. Give it 4.
