My mother worked with Dennis L. Rider for eleven years, not to mention the last office with him. When I announced it was BTK, I was shocked. Her whole day was just telling stories about how she had never seen him as a Wichita Killer. I have heard her re-tell them several times. I asked her about many things, and went to all the interviews she was asked to go to. I have read the entire book that was written about Ryder, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised by the possibility of something like that happening in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another BTK movie on TV not long ago, and I thought that would be better in filming Dennis's murder, and may have some subtle touches to his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very frank with the flaws in this film. This depends on my mother's portrayal of him, all my readings of him, and the videos I saw talking about her. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera angles were awesome. It looked as though he had been filmed on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I could not even see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rider did not have long hair. Dennis Rider was a "very anal man" and had a sort of "follow-up book rules". It was not as nice as making it look like it, and it was very polite and surprising, like business. The same goes for the killings he has committed, as far as we know. If you've seen his confession in court, you can guess. <br /> <br /> As for mania with slaughtered slaughter? No, I have not read or recognized Dennis Rider to have a problem with cruelty to animals or people who steal insects. In fact, cats and dogs were practiced on choking ways. However, across the entire film he was putting the animals in the victim's face and acting as if he cared about their welfare. <br /> <br /> Denis Ryder was never confined to the people he knew, he admitted, but in the film he was first killed, he told the lady that he also knew her. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to get into this movie, and I already annoyed me. This is not what you want to see if you're interested in the actual events of BTK. This is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want to get a very bad pornographic half with some slaughter scenes serving the side, then this is your movie type.
