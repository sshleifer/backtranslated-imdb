The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - What a laughable title, it's totally misleading. It is not surprising that filmmakers try to mislead us even though this is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> The story essentially contains a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. Too little happens in this movie. When something awakens the viewer's amazement, it is always an unintended comedy in the form of a terrible dialogue presented by a hopeless group of vocal artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors that make sounds appear as a group of ethics at the therapeutic level. It's really hard to determine how poorly representative you are when you have a dubbing for this ordeal. But the vocal artists can not be blamed in the script. It is a farce. Funny unintentionally at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general, to say the least, is unequal. Women's figures are particularly stupid. Men are either creepy or boring. <br /> <br /> The entire project is a clear exploitation of the public. Do not make what you promise remotely, and even when the murders begin (finally), all of them occur outside the screen. All we got was a few headless shots. <br /> <br /> Some people said this movie is giallo. I can not agree with that view. Anyone with Italian excitement should give this film a wide berth because there is nothing remotely exciting. It is a basic pornographic film with a horror angle. But it is not too exciting. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
