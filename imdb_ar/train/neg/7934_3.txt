The family that travels to the softball league decides for her daughter to walk the "natural way" and end up in the middle of nowhere. The father is an excited photographer, and when he hears an abandoned old side show in the city, decides to take another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side view is filled with innate freaks, who immediately abduct women and leave the young son and father to defend themselves. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this film is how the family actually fights against its original kidnappers. Other than that, there is nothing worth the trouble about the film.
