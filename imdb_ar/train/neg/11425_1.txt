I do not know what it was about this film that made me interact with it frankly. Perhaps the characters were not desirable and were not convincing enough to take care of them. Maybe it was an unorganized story. Perhaps the truth is that Rob Lowe was wearing a long, flowing shirt. Maybe that's because at some point in the film, they all burst into a song. Maybe that was because the 1980s were never in the 1980s. Maybe it was because everything was heavy and heavy. This may be because a person is pumping his grip while driving away from the camera while fading. I do not know what made me hate it, but if that means trying to watch it again, I'm not willing to find out.
