Carly Bob plays the role of JJ, a newly promoted food critic whose mother moves inflamed. JJ, shocked at this shift in events, then the owner of the restaurant, Alex, smiles to entertain her mother in exchange for "perhaps" to review his restaurant dying. Alex falls unexpectedly on the daughter during the mother's temperature rise. There are many problems in this film, the characters are two-dimensional in the world. JJ is a self-serving self-serving character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ colleagues in the magazine are ruthless and opportunistic. The basic message for more than 50 women is unable to make it on their own, without the help of bad, bad, bad male. The representation is uniformly boring, the script is uninspiring. The only saving movies of grace is the setting for New York City. I do not recommend this movie.
