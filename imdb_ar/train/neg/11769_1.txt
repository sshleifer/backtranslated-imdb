Someone owes me an apology. In fact, a lot of people are doing it. I will start. I have never been interested in Ang Ang, because of the bad comments nearby by consensus. Even excellent cable channels seemed to rarely show that. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on the USA network, wow .... <br /> <br /> Booty for Ang Lee and incredible Hullo <br /> <br /> It was boring! I almost did not make it through me. Eric Pana was not frank, Nick Nolte was terrible, and Sam Elliott was undesirable (which is not fun, usually a great figure). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Pana because his non-descriptive face was easier to simulate computer graphics - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk was aiming to liken Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant dog you were ready to give up Hulk as the worst supernatural film ever made. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About 3/4 through this hard film, there was a fun and exciting scene - and dare say - a convincing fun scene starts with Hulk outside the containment room at a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding the F22 Raptor. Stratosphere, just to be picked up in the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best series of events that were presented for a superhero movie. I must say, the CGI was very good. This does not mean that the structure was completely convincing. But it does not require the suspension of kufr much more than is required in many non-supernatural films. This is a wonderful achievement. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end has become very stupid as Bruce Banner's father turns into a kind of villain who changes his form, but the long sequence of the previous movement led to the shame of any short iron man's tournaments. . In general, apart from moving mutants, it really seemed as if the CGI at Hulk tried hard to convince you that it was real and interacting with its environment. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Well, but what about the amazing structure? Guess what ... it's boring too! Contains a few appearances by Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is terrible. The Hulk in Ang Lee may sometimes seem fake and caricature to others - but it also had convincing moments. The incredible structure looked positively silly. He had a skin color and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer texture. It really was really. The effects of lighting, the environment and the face on the latest 5 years of Ang Lee did not seem to look more than 10 years. There is really no excuse for that. We really live in an age where computer programmers can destroy a movie just like any director, actor or cameraman at all. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the writer and director of this film learned almost nothing from Ang Lee's "failure". All the same errors are made. Bruce Banner is practically passionate. The general is tireless, so monolithic that it looks false from the structure. Interest in love is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler a credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are very easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson is almost like Nick Nolte, although he is only in the film for a few minutes. Hulk really does not do much in this film, and certainly not more than the version of Ang Lee. The stunning structure was more rapid, but since nothing really happened, it was not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is all false as the structure looks. It is actually more interesting as a human being than a beast. <br /> <br /> This is the way I can categorically say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I have any chance to see Ang Lee again, I may be able to sit down to see the sequence of good actions, or else try To estimate the dialogue a little more (most likely I just fast forward to the good parts). But there is not one scene in The Incredible Hulk worth seeing once, not to mention twice. It's really at the bottom of the stack of superhero movies. CGI caricatures are an insult to the public - at least in the version of Ang Lee, they seem to have been trying to make them realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> How filmmakers plan to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by producing almost the same film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Edward Norton, he seems to be distancing himself from this film.
