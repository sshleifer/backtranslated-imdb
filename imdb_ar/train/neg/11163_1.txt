We loved Rock School and Black Jack. We could not wait to go to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the film was so bad and I wanted to get out of it. My husband also hated it. The only ridiculous parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the cinema and tell people to save their money. The writing was awful. He had all the horrible stereotypes of Hispanic people who should be totally insulted. The film was not long but for us it looked like eternal. The people in the theater were very disturbed and silent and it was like watching the paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure that there might be some recovered parts, but there was not. Save you money and your time.
