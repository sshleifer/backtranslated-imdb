The DVD version consists of two episodes, the fact that Caesar's altar is the turn. In addition, the Spanish language was without translation. Therefore, it is difficult for me to review this film in depth because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical symbol, the part is very difficult and I found that for the newcomer, Leonor Varela only plays well. She is a strong will but also a very supportive soul mate. Timothy Dalton as an idealist and their romance is the main thing in the first episode. So, it's not really a documentary, nor is it a big love story but a wonderful love story. <br /> <br /> After the genocide, a new lover comes (Marc Antoine) but the flavor is gone: always remember our first film. Love. Therefore, the second episode was boring and their tragic fate was not determined. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: large groups, tastefully decorated; the site of exotic Moroccan living and exquisite wardrobes. Producers have a lot of money for sure, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are very poor (blue screens, ships and sphinx) to the extent that it is funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to hear it in French or English to express a firm opinion on these two films.
