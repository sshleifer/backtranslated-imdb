I'm not entirely sure why you click "contains spoiler", because frankly there is not enough explanation offered in the film to see what it is supposed to spoil. <br /> <br /> Visually it delivers mostly. Well, apart from the rubber mask monsters that go back to about 80 years. I will say now that before watching this I never saw my Lourdes band, and I knew nothing about them except that they won Eurovision. It seems that the monsters in this band are members, largely in their personality phase. whatever. Anyway, I did not know that while watching. I thought only the monsters / devils were mostly acceptable. Approximately. <br /> <br /> I'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it might be better not to know. Maybe it was actually an incredible lame come to think of it. This action keeps it in good enough shape to keep the viewer entertaining, even if half of the entertainer flirting around the wtf is supposed to happen in this exact movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him four basically because I got a good laugh out of it, especially how he interprets something pretty much. The mood must be where I was, but I found that Hilla was funny for some reason. Then look for the movie online and discover that NOBODY knows what hell is supposed to be. She ridiculed me more, and raised my score by half an extra point to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's visually and visually beautiful. Overall, far from basic, but chapel. Do not expect too much and do not expect to have any meaning and you may be happy if you are in a good mood.
