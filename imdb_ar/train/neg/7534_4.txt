Mummies tell short stories about men and women and sex among them. Hey? At first, the mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Imagine having sex with this girl." Imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times, while flashing pictures of half of the nude youths. Later, the children's Defense Ministry boys tossed the mod with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or progress quickly) by combing the mummy, the shorts are not bad in themselves. I found them a little funny to some extent. My favorite is a person where a sexually harassed person tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while the pet cloud sits on the bed. This is a good film.
