First, I agree with the little that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His delivery of reality to an interesting point of view is what makes the man succeed in the circus of the university. He comes across lovable, humble, practical. It does not meet the current political style (the despicable double party) and puts its eyes on the far left as well as the extreme right, chasing both and for good reason. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a bird. In fact, I did not call this documentary but just a bunch of speeches. Viewing "Rebel without a Pause" does not differ from watching a speaker in a recorded section at 3am on CSPAN. No camera movements, no adjustments, no stylistic touches. There is no story or narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically, production is completely amateurish. The sound is terrible and asymmetrical. Sometimes we can not hear Noam speak, and sometimes we can not hear the questions posed by those present. When Noam speaks, it is rarely allowed to see the public's reactions until a quick shot is given to his wife, who apparently attends all his speeches and shows with pride every time we see him. /> I can not recommend this film and I would say it is better for you to see his recorded speeches on cassette tape or CD to listen to him in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous mood today.
