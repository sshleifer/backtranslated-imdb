This movie was like indie bad with a talent list. The plot was ridiculous, to the end. This reminded me a lot of something that came out of the home video market in the 1980s. I would give him one, but there were short moments when you could see the actors really struggling to make this useful. I think the worst thing is that the underwater scene has been stopped from the pier. It seems that underwater lighting came from no, and whenever we were supposed to care about it was about to run out of air, this air tank would appear somewhat. I would avoid this, unless there is something else on the shelf. Good day.
