The young man gets bad hair and goes out on a hill and falls in a place where he can not escape. Then, Mr. Atlas, the "legendary dude" of 2000 years ago as his best friend, Arnold Schwarzenegger look and vote alike.

Either way, this should not be tried at all, really! Our fictional character in power and power is nothing more than a typical stranger who seems ordinary to the rest of the universe. In addition to kayaking is the absence of anything new or attractive, and before you know it, there are some attempts of violence that are not described as "family" entertainment. The scene in which Atlas complains of his underwear laughs. Just spend a nice afternoon in the garden for change.
