I tried to watch this film at an army camp during an overseas mission, let me tell you, you will see anything under these circumstances. This is not part of the details. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone through poor representation of the quality of pornographic films, and the strange manipulation of conspiracies, situations and unreasonable behavior. It gets worse after that. This film does not contain a single saving grace, but it is not bad in a way that makes it funny. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those critics known as snakes. I mean, I'll enjoy most of the movies to some extent even if they're bad. This one ... man. <br /> <br /> The _well_ directive is clear from this one, my friend.
