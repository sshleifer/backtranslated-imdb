I have been waiting for this film for a long time. Especially since Juhi Chawla is a wonderful actress. <br /> <br /> This film contains six stories. It is a new concept flying from Hollywood. So it is not a new element. <br /> <br /> 1. Khomeini (Priyanka Chopra) is a dancer. She wants to get fame and make her boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. But then Rahul appeared (Salman Khan) and claimed to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not well represented. When he screams, I feel upset. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in its serious parts, it is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Sima (Juhi Chawla). He suffers a midlife crisis and is attracted to a younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor-en-Gohi Actors / Actors. they are great. But this story will be weak for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshay Khana) will marry Jia (Aisha Tkeya), but he gets his feet cold and hits the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Goh Ibrahim) is married to the grooming (Vidya Balan). She suffered an accident and suffered from amnesia. Now she does not know she likes her husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. Stephanie meets Shannon Iserwitz, a white woman who loves an Indian male but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Stavani to that man, but he falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Govinda never liked movies. It's very annoying, not funny. But in this film I liked it a lot, as it was growing in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Definitely yes! There is Suhail Khan! Ram Dayal is married to Volwati (Isha Kubikar). He wants to take some serious action with her, but every time her family comes between them. <br /> <br /> Suhail Khan is not handsome, but funny! I love his movies. <br /> <br /> Now this is the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make the story of one of the six stories not interesting does not make the entire film interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but they are not important for the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Lose that woman in the Bollywood industry. Suhail Khan was making more films, and for him it was too small. Salman Khan can not act comic roles, but serious movies are real. This is written in his life as an actor. This film is a waste of a group of actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhay Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It looks just as if you had the ability to produce a movie with Amitabh. Bachchan, you just let him sing a hymn.
