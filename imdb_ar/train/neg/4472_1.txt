"Smile Love You" is a pathetic comedy that does not really make sense. I do not mean the story is complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: the desperate and costly attempts of the husband to imagine the children. People who have tried so hard should have forgotten the adoption option, which they do not like. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays the role of Jennifer Robertson, a complete contrast to anything the MLM offers, and shows almost any sense of independence. She is a very boring character as a dreamy housewife with nothing else in mind except having children. Like a stupid romantic comedy at the age of fifty, Greg Kenner is her husband who offers equally any personality, no independence, and for our part, no interest. <br /> <br /> They are the most boring and often annoying character, hardly making comedies that should give themselves many accidents, which should arise from a couple who do their best to get pregnant. Otherwise, they actually do nothing but go to the fertility clinic and expel much money to do what they can do in their own privacy (except in the in vitro fertilization number). This plot hardly allows any accidents, because the couple does nothing to create any kind of strange situations. They only go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> Sub-plans are designed to test the couple's fulfillment, a moral element necessary in the story because the couple plan to have children together. Jennifer works in a new era shop with her friend (played by Joan Cusack) and is working on an erotic development. Christopher McDonald plays the role of interested buyer, and Jennifer is the promising negotiator at a great price for her products and friends. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested (though Joan Cusack is very funny in the restaurant scene). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect, who has the opportunity to earn some extra money to cover the clinic bills, by taking up a job in Seattle, where his boss is a seductive seducer (also a helpless female character) trying to influence Danny (stupid as he is) to have a relationship with her once things are rocky properly with him and his wife (for reasons I do not care to give up). Jill Hennessy is good in this role, but her character is highly predictable, and a very synthetic formula as a very necessary element to a conflict with Danny. It's stupid and again, hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> The overall movie itself is quite boring and is hardly funny at all (except for the restaurant scene and the airline flight). The plot does not offer anything interesting. Even if the story is about two people trying to get pregnant, the book has been able to discover several fun events to develop. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are full silouhettes of 1950s stupid comedy with happy wife and ignorant husband. So, even without any incidents in the plot, the characters themselves offer nothing interesting, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> Joan Kusak must be in the lead and someone else should be Kenner. Kozak would even make a poor story terribly funny (as she sometimes does in her role here). This is definitely one to end.
