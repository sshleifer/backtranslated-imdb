The actors did a really good job in playing their roles - especially the mother. However, as the film progressed, I found that I watched it more for their own sake and not because I cared about it at least for people. At times, I felt angry at the irresponsible and thoughtful approach to education that was being repeatedly presented. The daughter is a 17-year-old shallow laugh. Her main aspiration to life is to look at famous men and become a dancing sister (with lots of "booing"). The son is a self-respecting man who seems very desperate for relationship and friends - so much so that he threw a late drug concert. Husband and wife feel bored, but instead of putting energy in their old relationship, they are looking for new partners (although the wife disappears badly, because the man who "throws herself" is gay --- pardon!) I just felt that all The characters needed to grow and I had difficulty caring for such shallow tremors. I believe that the author's attempt was to prove the absolute immorality of the capitalist system and its full potential. However, given that these characters are not typical of the average Western family, it seems illogical.
