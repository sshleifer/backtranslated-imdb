This film has little to recommend, although it is only a picturesque landscape, cinematography and wildlife trend, but it is difficult to put its weaknesses in the company of such rave reviews. It is precisely these things that make the absence of a satisfactory plot and its implementation disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my children and none of us were very impressed by the end. Yes, the pictures were wonderful, the vast landscape through the jungle and the mountains was wonderful, but what was going on in the foreground? The somewhat obscure narrative of the unclear girl's stupidity that slowly learns a very fundamental lesson about establishing friendly relationships with wildlife - and ends very easily because of the track record of this kind of thing. It is certainly not a new story. In fact, there is no novel about how it is listed, and we have all seen this before, and indeed, more eloquently by Antoine de Saint Exupery. <br /> <br /> The only thing you really need to get out of this movie is the sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
