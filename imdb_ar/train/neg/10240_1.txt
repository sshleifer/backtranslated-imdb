I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. However, the survival does not amount to ambient noise. <br /> <br /> I can not give her any points about authenticity. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same features, or rephrasing what others have done. He has just become a cop of independent films to take us on an evil journey through the jungle, crazy assassin, and until recently, throw in some crazy family. On those lines, I must compare them with the likes of Texas Chinsao, and the turn error (although the twisting is so obvious), and others. Survival is a short way against similar films. The plot is not only original in any way. Some movies can get a weak plot (and over-executing) with a great representation, a special FX, or a large number of other factors. Survival does not have anything from this to the bank on. If you want, note the following: Movie representation never starts. I do not knock or blame the actors on it, nor the director. The dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors concerned (not saying he did not) did not show the talent to pull it out. Recall 2 standouts. Sure, the lead man in this film has his appearance, but I seriously think he needs to think about more training before he's ready to make a movie. The actor who shot Greg also had potential, but we could not see any of them (see the movie to see why, you would not believe it). <br /> <br /> The film is granular. Yes, this little film that makes magic films is designed to take us to glory days in the films "Grindhouse". In today's film industry, it has become a gimmick. It either works or does not work. In this case it does not work only. There are a lot of other flaws that happen, so it ends up distracting the film, not adding it. However, I think they did a good job of adding these grains. This is some good grain. I think using a different script, better direction, and maybe reps, they should try another try for "Grindhouse". They will probably withdraw. <br /> <br /> As for technical aspects, in my opinion, they never predicted me. It was possible to be more careful with the sound (sounds seemed to be directly inserted into the camera, but nothing wrong) and to capture it on DV, it was very smooth for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I can say about it .....
