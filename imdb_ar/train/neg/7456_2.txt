This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it is close. The producers stole this film for an hour and a half of my life, and I want to bring it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for 10 minutes. His high-pitched voice and mild insanity begin to grow old, and then realize that the rest of the film is much worse. It is located in a long queue of ex-hackers who tried the movies. Some were brilliant, and some failed miserably. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was wonderful, then okay, then not very funny, then died ... so I think he hits the entire spectrum in a profession. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like Plague. </ B> <br /> c
