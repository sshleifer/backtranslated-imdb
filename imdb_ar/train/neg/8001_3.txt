The monster - it was wonderful. I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Creature From the Black Lagoon." The scenes ranged with this monster who wanders the earth and captures people from good to jaw dropping. <br /> <br /> Social commentary: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as doctors (under orders from the government) stating that SARS-like disease exists. In short, we got a familiar government cover story. As you know, I expect that liberal mentality with Hollywood movies will always think our government is corrupt, but the Koreans seem to be coordinating, which is very hard. Here, it takes away the excitement and thrill of this "monster". She just pulled the film down. The main family that appeared in the film must see it from a distance, while the young girl in her supposed dead family was excluded from the creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: Typical "no water pollution" "message because this is what can happen - a terrible mutant monster." This was the message against the nuclear bomb since 1950 when radiation caused the ants giants, spiders, fish or any Another thing in these sci-fi movies is now "environmental issues" that are the focus. <br /> <br /> Humor was mostly stupid, I usually laugh at a joke but it was not funny. The Korean sense of humor is pathetic or the film was intentionally trying to be trite with the old "Godzilla" movies. Let's hope it is the last one. <br /> <br /> Transportation - Moving The video was good, it was an attractive image, and the sound was right with a lot of noise from the fans in the rear speakers.I saw this in Korean with an English translation.This may have been wrong because the sounds of Korean hymns became annoying after half an hour. In general - this was a promise but it turned out to be a big and even boring disappointment in many sites, and the unforgivable movie of the modern beast was two hours too long for this story. How this film drew record crowds in Korea I do not know. They should not have much in the way of movies to enjoy and support.
