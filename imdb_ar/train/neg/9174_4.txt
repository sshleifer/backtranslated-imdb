I usually like zombie movies, but this movie was very bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: a girl swimming naked with thong bottoms, naked Sonia Salome, and Ona Grauer mammals mocking at the foggy peak when she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: lots of videos, lots of slow matrix motion (that pulls motion), not enough blood and courage, bad representation, not story. The only other person in the theater was smart and left immediately after the nude swimming scene. The total waste of $ 6 and time. I give it 2 out of 10.
