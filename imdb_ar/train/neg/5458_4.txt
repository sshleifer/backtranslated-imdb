This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letorno. To do this, they took a look at a 19-year-old man, and perhaps not "to do it." It was not possible to portray a boy of 12 or 13 as a boy because the scenes of love would attract everyone (even if allowed) - as they should. Her friend Mary Ann was my nephew, making her gay. Sixth grade, people. The definition of sexual exploitation of children does not have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really do not care about her unhappy upbringing or marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the level. The reason given is that they are bipolar, rejected the diagnosis, and refused to take their medication. It is understandable, therefore, that they were not thinking rationally. One hopes now to understand her actions. <br /> <br /> Now that I have married Vili and have given birth to two children together, I pray that God be on her treatment and think clearly. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Penelope Anne Miller was very convincing and exemplary in this role.
