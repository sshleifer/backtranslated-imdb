After buying the DVD in the "bargaining box" because of the sheer amount of features included on the cover, I appeared in the DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animation menus and a host of additional features ... but when I played the movie itself, what a failed order. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the film here in the IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So do not believe it unless you want to waste your money!
