I'm not a fan of the horror film, but my sisters and cousins ​​are. So, I saw the first film. It was terrible and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am following. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not absurd. I can buy disasters that happen in the desert. I can buy a mutant presence. I can even buy that events may be so strange and strange that the military may decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my belief. <br /> <br /> However, I am not prepared under any circumstances to believe that the military team in charge of rebuilding such a zone will not be able to deal with the mutants. As a member of the US Army, I can confirm that while new recruits may lack the sophisticated eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any of these recruits will be integrated into a capable squadron. <br /> <br /> An armed band of soldiers are not about to be taken out by some of the killers with knives. That's how it works. Band movements, the superior firepower to a large extent, and of course the radio support, will guarantee nothing less than full victory. I'm not saying you will not be losing, but once you check the area as hostile, military training will take precedence, and nobody will explode on its own until you use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> If it was discovered that the area was so infested with enemies that the team was not able to deal with the danger, they would do the radio for backup. Believe me, their radios will not be jammed. If there is a chance that ordinary radios will not work, the team will have a satellite phone. Possibly, if they can not check in every hour, the search will be called. <br /> <br /> In order to accept this film, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is attached to a map and compass, our military forces are full of smart, well-trained and competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are much less than our ability to handle them. <br /> <br /> With the full implementation of the film, which relies heavily on the impossible to imagine, the film failed to deliver. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors and pilots are unable to deal even with the most modest threats. <br /> <br /> As an old warrior, I find the film humiliating.
