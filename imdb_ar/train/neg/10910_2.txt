I've seen an interview with Rob Schneider (who plays the role of Marvin Mang in this film). He says he wants to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if the sound is turned off, it will laugh in this film. Obviously it must be the secret. I had the volume. I was already listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster and not quite familiar - a big disappointment after the funny performance of Schneider in "Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo." <br /> <br /> The story is stupid: Mange is a big loser who dreams of being a policeman filled with a handful of animal transplants after a crazy scientist named Dr. Wilder (Michael Katon), and as a result he is losing control of his "animal instincts "He said. Of course, he has a bad habit of eating cows for people and trying to seduce their goats, but surely this is the little price you have to pay? It just did not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> The cast has left much to be desired: Is there a more outrageous actor in Hollywood than John McKinley? Here, Sergeant Cesc, commander of the police force, is playing as an obnoxious cartoonist Largely the character of his doctor in the famous TV series "Scrubs.") I was eager to take a look at Lincoln's first "serious" In the film "The Survivor", she has earned her fame as a contestant in the film "What's Serious?"), Which proves her familiarity here: She is a nice guy, but what she does not prove here is that she has a special talent as an actress. Ed Asner as chief of police, Wilson, I mean, how old is this man now? It's the size of some of the cows that Mang tried to eat, and he started to breathe completely, and I'm surprised he did it through photography. The executive producer of this.) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I laughed over and over again: Mange plays his sharp games in the police car, scene Schneider has With Haskell and Orangutan - Orangutan has a more representative talent! Therefore, for a chuckle - 2/10.
