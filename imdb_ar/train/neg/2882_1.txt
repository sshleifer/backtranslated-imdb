This film is the biggest steam stack you know about, being from Winchester in Wichita Kansas; I know the fact that 90% of the film was from Pogos. Regardless of the names of some of the victims, there was nothing else true. It seems the film was made by my dad's easy-to-use camera and contained footage I think came from another film along with footage from a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of bad acting, poorly formed or non-existent groups and a very dull and short end. It was a struggle to see it all the way. I recommend that you do not waste your money on this movie or be sorry. crush
