I tried to watch this film without being able to sit in it, because I was supposed to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously being produced according to a certain interpretation of the Bible. Interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. In addition, I am obsessed with films and the acting in this film was absolutely unacceptable. I have never had a negative rating for a movie. So, if you want to be continually preached by those who have no power, by all means, get this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who like or like science fiction, because the title will fool many people too. This was a regrettable film, because the basic idea had potential and was dispelled. The only quality that can be recovered in the film is that it made me realize that the character in the "Time Machine" might have had to show a little more moral outrage at the strange behavior of those in his future.
