After a semi-Gothic musical video, the film begins with the killing of lead singer Cassidy herself. In a perfect world it would be end-end credits. We do not live this world. The disgruntled band members decide to go to some clowns to communicate with their dead essence. When I say clown, I mean the actual clown. Tell them that they will all die through the ghost of Cassidy (the soul possesses Dora, one of his teammates). We could not care too much because all the characters were boring, obscene, and acted terribly. Written by Adam Hackbarth (the title of an unbelievable Aberobus if there is one title), directed by Corbin Timberbrook (who after his host, Blood Tower, he has to find out that he continues to make craps for a living), this film is a constant battle between film incompetence and need Scenes to stay awake. There is not enough blood to satisfy hunting dogs, nor enough nudity to satisfy deviations. In fact, there is absolutely nothing recommended by anyone. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway Become Naked <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: Stars On Demand
