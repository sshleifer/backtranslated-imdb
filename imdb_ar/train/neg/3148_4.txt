Basically the story of a man versus nature, this film contains beautiful cinematography, the fertile forests of Ceylon, and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film will never last. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and is later attracted to the farm worker's head, played by Dana Andrews. The farm is under the influence of the late father of late Peter Finch, who casts a shadow over Elvant Wook, who has become a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch, the elephants determined to restore their traditional way to the water that was banned when the palace was built through their right of access. The monsters go on a rampage and provide the best moments of movement in the picture. Taylor and Andrews faced some good moments struggling to remain a loyal wife despite marital difficulties with Finch.
