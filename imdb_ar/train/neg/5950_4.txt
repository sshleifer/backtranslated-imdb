My first question after watching this movie was, "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intent is to tell a story from the boy's point of view, it is not well executed. Of course there was a complicated use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but a lot of critical action happened outside his scope. Having a "master" character unable to speak (clearly indicating mute mode, and child weakness) makes it difficult to give this character a deep depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "Dramatic works or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypes, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic ethics, and conflict." LIAM fits this definition of T. The viewer is struck on the head with pictures Typical stereotypes of the fire and the Catholic Church in the school's strict clutter and the well-fed priest pressured the money from the parishioners. (The stereotype that has become so tired.) What's more - Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the film could have been predicted ... Who did not think we thought Teresa was checking the toilet after her mother told her, "My daughter will not get away from another woman's toilet!" I am a British realtor if he is good. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
