I can say unequivocally that during my 50 years on this planet, this film was the worst film (supposed to be children) I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I took my three big children to see him and even they were struggling to raise a smile in 90 minutes crooked. I would leave her for another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. You must pay to see it do not pay them. It's really really horrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be charged with taking money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Aplogise my misspellings, but I'm so upset that it spoiled my time with my grandchildren with regards, Steven
