Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Dear, like bees, get it? This is called futile prophesied. <br /> <br /> Edward Baskett: huh? (On the way) Basket: Here is your blood, a little girl. You should not be interested in your own luggage. <br /> <br /> A little girl: Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! bubble! fizz! pop?? Cart: I think there's something bad about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Cart: Mmmm. Vicodin! What?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! The handwriting of a previous girl has improved for me. Look, her lost daughter looks sort of like the girl who was carrying a doll I was responsible for killing somehow. And it kind of has a hairline. I wonder, should I torture myself and go to find her? Let's see what my friends think about in the camp. <br /> <br /> A fellow policeman in a basket: HAHAHA. Willow funny name. <br /> <br /> Cart: I think there's something bad about to happen. <br /> <br /> (on the island) Cart: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Tree name crone: It's not her daughter, <br /> <br /> (in the bar) Cart: Can you change that? Lunch at the big bar called the tree: huh? Basket: (Smashing Bee). All is well. <br /> <br /> The beautiful actress who was previously promising to play an erotic maid in the bar: that's good. Honey is not a plant, though. <br /> <br /> (On the green side) Willow: Oh, yeah, I forgot, you are the father of my child, Conan, I mean Rowen. (Yawning). I've stayed and lived with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a bee cell princess, instead. I mean, do not mind. (Gestures off, awake tremors, widens the eye to anime proportions). Mua, kiss. I love you! What were we talking about? Cart: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. wink. why. Do you. You are. Screaming. in a. I? Is it because I was raised in Vicodin? Sniff. snoring. What were we talking about? Cart: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My ear is my lips. <br /> <br /> (In the school room) Rose: What is the man? Twins are not welcome, in perfect harmony: Phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? sound echo? Cart: Stay away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: I'm a good twin. <br /> <br /> Cart: I think something bad is about to happen. (in hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hi? Special, ah, ah, oh bother. The old bear is silly. snoring. <br /> <br /> (In Queen's Palace) Summer Sister: You have a lot of potential. what are you doing here? Were not you Cher's lover slapping him in the face at Moonstruck? (Licks the lips.) Cart: I was about to ask you the same thing. Where's the sister girl Summersisle: How unmanned on. Let's talk about the importance of "me". Basket: Watch out for that truck that's heading towards us! آآآآآه! Oh. Did not matter. God damn it! (POP other bead). Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back to the bar) The Big Bunch Lunch Bunch: I've tried the Weight Watchers program, Jenny Craig, South Beach, and I've been up the size of the suit since last year. <br /> <br /> The tree name is crone: HAHAHA. All you have to do is roast this rotten cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Big Boned Hazel: Completely. <br /> <br /> Cart: It was the last straw that broke the back of the basket basket! Take this, wink! (Her molluscs.) (Edward Baskett is under the mysterious attack from behind) snap out of it! Leave the island already and take me with you! Do I have to talk to you or what? Surprise out of it, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take this, Winck! (She kicked her bravely in the face, her eyes rolling in her head and becoming two Xs.) Nervous Hanan: Snore? (In roast Nicholas Cage) Ellen Burstein: Who can forget the part of the cell phone ring of the basket in the middle of the scene of the suit of the bear and then drop the call. Wireless ad-like: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Behan: Remember when you produced the bullets that you got from the basket weapon? He looked very surprised. You should be more careful with your luggage, Nick. Ha ha ha. And your film choices. <br /> <br /> Everyone: The unmanned aerial vehicle must die! Basket: (screaming) Oh, yeah, you dog? Well, roasting will not help your dear! Ah. My legs! Honey, (dear, take it?) I turned off that flame and moved away from the basket. honey! Says Smokey Bear does not play with matches. Ha ha ha. What??? Look for a quasi-locomotive truck! Uh! Oh. Goddammit, these past memories of the drug experimental phase of the seventies have become old! Where is my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad is about to happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close up. God damn it! (After six months) attractive magnificence in the dress of modern times: I said to the issue of the basket bearing a name carries me with him. <br /> <br /> A small drone of innocent young people: I love helping people. /> Annoying Wint: Then take me out of my contract for a sequel! I think something bad is about to happen. EEEEE!
