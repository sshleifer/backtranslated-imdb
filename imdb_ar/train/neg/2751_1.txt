I hate even wasting the time it takes to write 10 lines on this brutal act. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky because bad filmmaking is not a big crime or he will die twice to write and guide this disaster. I am surprised that this film has a budget of $ 75 million, but I am really happy that it was a huge fluctuation, in the hope that he could not make another film for the rest of his life. I think it was possible for the actors to gather and describe it now. <br /> <br /> With the resources available, it was possible to produce a great movie using this budget. As usual, the failure should have been initially monitored with the terrible text and story. The Transformers were another visual feast with weak text, but this made it look like a "Ken Citizen".
