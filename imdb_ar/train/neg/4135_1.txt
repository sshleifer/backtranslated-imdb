This film was so bad and I had to go most of it to get good pictures. Huh what good bit? The only thing that was worth it was the end (those who watched the movie would know what I mean). I was expecting a lot of this film as the underworld meets the Dawn of the Dead and meets Freddie vs. Jason but what I got is this crap. The story was memorable, the cast was badly used and what the director was thinking when he did it. This could have been great but I turned out to be the most boring film I've ever seen. Well, what if there was a little T and A, I was after the trouble and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect the film to be good, but if you want a nasty cowardly horror, then watch it in all senses and see how a horror movie should not be.
