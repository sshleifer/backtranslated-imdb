I have seen bad films, but this took the picture. No sense, all the characters do swear every few seconds, Oh I think one has a low sperm count. this is good. Willy plays Cockney swear. The English bloke game plays a terrible, unpopular role in a field of rice, while some of the less glamorous lights play on light pancakes. <br /> <br /> There are some Russian bands. Oh yes, someone has a weapon and maybe he talks about garbage while he occupies a high position in drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like Plague.
