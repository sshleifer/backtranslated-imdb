Hubert Selby Jr. introduced "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the script in his Aronofsky film. This film has succeeded at every level by providing an intimate and unbiased picture of the horrors of the lives of characters and vices that destroyed them. "Another Exit to Brooklyn" still has underworld and multiple characters living a sad life, but barely doing the same justice that Aronovsky did. <br /> <br /> The film appears to be anti-gay at times. Especially when the film in homosexuality equals death. A gay figure is stoned, being fired towards the sky by a speeding car, and dead ground on the pavement. Another is crucified and there is still more beatings. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, which may actually be convincing if done well, is the scenes of trade union workers fighting a fight with strike killers. Who would have thought that a drama about Brooklyners would show a series of events and explosions in trucks? <br /> <br /> Director Edel Edel enjoys a skill level such as the level of the TV director, but much less than reality. Movies. The film is clunky which can not even seem to settle on the genre. Leake was given a useless role that any model could have filled, and it seems Baldwin only knows how to look stupid in the small part of it. Then comes Jennifer Lee Lee in the lead, an annoying prostitute called Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not joking). Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is at least as dirty. Poor use of color and configuration makes it seem cheaper than it is, as it removes the "real" edge for the most provocative bits. Failure.
