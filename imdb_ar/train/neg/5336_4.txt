This film is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis I've ever seen. He has little plot, mostly partying, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are lost. I do not know why they did this movie. You can say that Elvis was also wasted, it's much better in "Follow That Dream".
