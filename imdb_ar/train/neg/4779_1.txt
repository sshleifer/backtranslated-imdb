In 2004, I was impressed. Then he became very stupid. This indicates that children are mindless. It humiliates children. Cartoon network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hemataro. She managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children programming. Like the show (Foster's house for imaginary friends) put 20 tablespoons of sugar in the sprite. It seems that current TV producers are only interested in making money, instead of sharing the fantasies of children and making money! Recently, my children follow the old (1960s) programs to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television can look back on its past and recycle children's programs from the past few days.
