A long, painful, transient and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth film "Sydney Lumette", Garbo Tux, is quickly introduced to the low-end quality of my research. <br /> <br /> The film documents a young man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Roll (Anne Bancroft), an eccentric, a brawler and, above all, a fan of Horace Garreto Garbo. When Estelle gets brain tumors, her son decides to go on a manic quest of his own: tracking Greta Garbo, bringing her to his mother. <br /> <br /> Ann Bancroft is full, the viewer chews, Auntie-Mame puts it here, this kind of fight the film likes, where she talks to people, defends her ideals, and ends up in prison all the time. Stands outside the film as a clear industrial establishment, and every scene with it Yuk Yok lame; every false hit note. The rest of the characters are equal in dimensions, but less interesting. Ron Silver is as flat as possible, and his beloved love triangle is like the telegraph, like everything else in the film: It's up to the rich Lisa Rolf (Carrie Fisher), but he's become fond of his eccentric teammate Jane Mortimer (Katharine Hicks) Three scenes before they occur. <br /> <br /> This is the other problem. Single-dimensional characters can survive if put in an exciting and captivating story, but simply nothing is here. The speed of the film is glacial, filled with exotic material that does not strengthen anything at all, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is full and uninteresting. There are so many guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Verstein as my New Yorker (imagine it) in another very unimportant scene. <br /> <br /> Late in the film, he tries to make half the way a decent statement about the nature of idol worship and its role in our lives, but by then, there are no characters as real characters, and the film has bothered me to submit, so he It works as a very few, far too late. The film is my 25th film directed by Lumet, making it the most easily watched filmmakers, but outside some awful movies (a stranger among us, anyone?), Has not proven the depths of Garbo Talks. . <br /> <br /> {Grade: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (of 24) 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet movies}
