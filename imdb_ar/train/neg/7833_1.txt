I just saw the third week of the series of nightmares of Steven Kings' nightmares and Dreamscapes; that is, I have seen 6 episodes so far. I must say that the stories are really weak. Stephen King, the great crew of Stephen King, has read a collection of his short stories that have been published on the way back. I remember that most of the stories were mediocre to poor but there was a really excellent story, if not great. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that this mini-series is just a collection of stories from Stephen King that does not mean it would be any good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories is meaningful, most of this mini-series will be mediocre to poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I have not read these new short stories. They may be as good as stories in a book and are not easily adaptable to TV, or maybe it was a scriptwriter's error trying to write an interesting script. Who do you know? Also, these short stories may be designed exclusively for this small series and not for printing purposes. This may be the problem. If Stephen King has sent these strange stories to an editor, I'm sure the editor has told him immediately to make them more exciting because they are, they are simply boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from all this is that the problem is in stories / text and not actors and actresses because this mini-series has some excellent people who act on it. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series makes me really appreciate these old "Twilight Zone" series.Each series was only half an hour but it was convincing and installed .I do not understand why this mini-series could not achieve a similar achievement. Of course, this mini-series has a lot of money to make a good mini-series, but unfortunately, you do not have to click something. <br /> <br /> For example, there were two series this week. Who buys a painting by an artist who committed suicide, begins to see the changes in the picture as he drives his car home (I will not even mention the second episode of this week involving criminals and looting them because they were more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> The premise is interesting and therefore the story must be good but after I saw I was frustrated because there are so many gaps in the story besides the extraneous material that showed that it did not help anything in the story.After the last scene, left me more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to enter this mini-series, but it was very tight because of the stories / bad texts. If this is a movie, I have recommended people wait for the movie to appear on the cable or so. I do not even recommend it as a tenant in your video store. However, since this is on the TNT channel, a cable channel, I would say if you have not already seen it, then try it for one week. If you do not like that week, you will not like the previous series or future series, as they all share the same boring feature.
