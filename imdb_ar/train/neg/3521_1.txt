I still feel comfortable seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've watched action movies, so I liked a lot of them, but this film tops the top. <br /> <br /> Not only is the worst actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the leading role, but the plot is very stupid from the start (why do not you steal money while the plane is on the ground, would you be from hell much easier ) It requires someone with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the manuscript does not contain any real distortions at all, so a three-year-old can guess what happens next. It's a bunch of clich√©s, with Sly performing worse than his other films (even better in Rambo III if you watched this movie as a comedy instead of a motion picture). Now there is a representative who can not act a) surprised b) sad c) anything other than his primary face. <br /> <br /> I still want to point out that this movie has two factors that may make some people like them. The bangs are wonderful, but then ... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are great, but then ... There are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better scenes this way, rather than wasting time with that click. <br /> <br /> Go to watch another movie instead there are hundreds, and even thousands of best motion movies.
