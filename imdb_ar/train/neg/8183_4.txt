This fluff piece is somewhat tame about breaking World War II symbols, or stealing them, etc. Representation about what I was expecting from the MGM "B" cast. <br /> <br /> One big warning. Jean Rogers, who has played such a wonderful role in playing the role of Del Arden in the very first two episodes of Flash Gordon, is appalling in this film. Her personality is very disturbing. She certainly does not leave her exaggerating. We are supposed to believe that during the height of the World War in what will be a very secret code facility, it will only be allowed to enter and exit any office you choose even though it does not have an official job. From this point of view, I'm sorry I saw this movie. I have forever changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers. Talent, it is very light weight. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is the same usual, that means it's just enough. <br /> <br />
