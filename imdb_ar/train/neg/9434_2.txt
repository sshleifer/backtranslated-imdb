Since it is banned as a "bad video" in the UK, Unhinged naturally gained a great deal of fame. However, the most shocking thing I have found about the film is its being in all sections. The bloodshed that I deal with: terrible representation, poor editing, terrible guidance, lousy texts and stark soundtrack were much harder than before. <br /> <br /> Three girls collide on their way to a music festival in a valley during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The shy old lady and her daughter Alansia welcome the girls and allow them to stay for a few days to recover. However, does not someone want to leave the girls? One by one they fall victim to an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> It takes a long time to progress and show some of the worst performances ever made in a horror movie (this requires some doing), Unhinged is really a terrible movie. Music is a complete mess (it seems that a three-year-old boy has been left on a blender) and as such, completes the film perfectly. Only a few bloody scenes in the end and a bit of unwarranted nudity saves Unshed from getting as little as possible. <br /> <br /> If you are full of horror (and unfortunately, I), you will want to see this to mark it in the Video Nasty watch list. But be careful? It is really very bad.
