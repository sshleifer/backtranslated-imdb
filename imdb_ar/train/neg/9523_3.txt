The plot of this film is not strong at all, a lot of holes. If you approach the movie as a car, there are not many wonderful cars in this movie. The reason I like it is that I'm from the area where they were filmed. Get the most out of the best known places in St. Louis. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. It is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems that whenever a film is made here, everyone wants some relationship with it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video shops where all were stolen as soon as they appeared on the VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on the Ebay website, and I find it interesting to have a drag race track around the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
