If I do not have to watch this for work reasons, I will not have exceeded the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit I was quickly transmitted through parts. The movie version '63 was significantly superior in all respects. Yes, I have read that this play is more faithful in the original play, but what is the wisdom that the writer has changed the script in '63! It is verbose, it is extended, and the songs in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginable. The version of "Kids" in version 63 was a very funny and classic classic of sarcastic mother humor. In this release, Kim is very old, Conrad is very awesome * (When someone took off his shirt, he was disgusted by it ... The manager of this version had no idea what was exciting). Conrad can not dance, can not sing (he can not even stay in tune) and he is simply disgusting. If Elvis Presley really had his career finished before he started. For other actors, I was waiting for Alexander to fall as he danced and Dali ended his role as a mother. Watched Stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role that was performed correctly by someone who understood the comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a complete waste of time for anyone.
