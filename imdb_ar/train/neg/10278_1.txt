The worst single movie I have ever seen in the theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and my mind exploded that this movie was accepted into a festival. It was a wonderful introduction, and it looked like it could go somewhere, but it disintegrated every time I tried to do anything. First of all, if you're going to do my music, look for someone who has a musical talent. The music consisted of a playful piano that looked as if they were playing on a stereo in the room they were filming. The words were terribly written, and when the rhymes were not clear, the sad rhymes that showed how stretched they were to try to make the film work. You think you'll find people who can sing when making music, right? Not in this case. Luckily, they spoke half of them / half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they sang they made me a rampage. Especially when they tried to sing in harmony. This only handles music. It was some good acting, but a lot of dialogue was terrible, as were most of the scenes. They obviously did not have enough coverage on the scenes, or had a bad editor, because they were always standing on the line and using awesome options while cutting the film. At least, the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the text until they added the hook to make it musical. I hope investors will make sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
