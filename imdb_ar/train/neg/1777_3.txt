If you are a movie pioneer who enjoys original content and a smart thrill ... look elsewhere, for kids, because Sleepwalkers really suck. I'm usually more eloquent than that, but ... Wow ... this was bad. I especially like it when Charles introduces Tanya to a trip home, she refuses, then is seen walking in the house. Where is his car? In any case, do not see it, people. I really want to be more specific, but the words survive me. Cats jump on people. A man stabs the corn. Cheesy lined up the proverb "wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I'm taking it again! His vision of the book was hijacked by Stephen King as a man who owned the cemetery. It's actually very good. Even with the appearance of Mark Hamel and Ron Perlman, King offers the best performance for the film. But, otherwise ... wow ... bad.
