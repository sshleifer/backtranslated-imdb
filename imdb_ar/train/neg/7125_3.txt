It turned out that VILLA RIDES (1968) was a great disappointment! Although Sam Beckenba had a role in the script, along with Robert Town, it still appears as a beautifully written and dry film directed by Buzz Kulik. First, Bill Brenner's best bill because Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not a character attractive enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His outstanding performance one lacks fire and can be Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Rowland into the role. Brenner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat wearing a Mexican bandit costume in the middle of the Mexican Revolution instead of the Russian Revolution. Also, Robert Mitchum misses the second bill completely in the picture! His role as a two-plane plane dropping homemade bombs from the air for revolution is a poorly written, poorly written role that any secondary star could play. Mitch does not have a decent line in the entire film and puts in mind the revolutionary image of other Mexican "Bandido" superior (1956) which unfortunately does not seem to have anyone interested in releasing on DVD. In addition to the lack of any kind of elegance "Villa Rides" also suffer badly without a female star! There is star Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a happy eye but pours just a mop. Perhaps someone like Claudia Cardinal or Jean Peters could add a few more cracks in the troubled story line. <br /> <br /> There are some good motion scenes in the film, but there are two good motion movies that do not make a film, the quality of the perfect Panavision image, and the more frequent melody of Maurice Garry does not help. <br /> <br /> As in Paramount, there will be no extras - not even a trailer! Yes, the film was disappointing and the DVD presentation could have been and should have been much better.
