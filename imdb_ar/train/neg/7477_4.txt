The film is a fairly thick road with some comic satisfaction provided by John Cleese excellent (although he really sends his performance at the Volti Towers). He seems to be turning from the top of the slowness to the intense emotional at the point of hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Aaron must "find themselves", who they are, and so on.
