Ernst Lubeck's latest film, performed by Otto Breminger after Loewisch's sudden death during production, is a mix of sophistication, finesse, romance, music, fantasy, and theatrical costumes. In a nineteenth-century castle in southeastern Europe, the Countess is in her arch enemy, the leader of the Hungarian Revolution; her ancestors, whose magic picture is magically assisted, helped her. The most beautiful Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig decorated with roses, was more beautiful and her songs very enjoyable. Unfortunately, this scenario (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an opera by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is full of different ideas that fail to intertwine - or entertain. The results are good looking, but they are not understood. * 1/2 of ****
