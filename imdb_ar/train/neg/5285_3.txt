Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's work, one should simply read them. I agree with that. However, we love the adaptation of great literature, and strike the current writers strike that without a good book, it is difficult for actors to return their roles to life. The current version of the PERSUASION of Jane Austen shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well written adjustment. This version is not compared to the 1995 version with Amanda Rott and Ciaran Hinds, which was well done and retained the essence of the times and the restrictions on characters (except for the strange and kissing view of the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows Ann is stupid who seems worried. The other characters were not very sophisticated and a crime, considering how Austin could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen perceptions. The series of events that were logical in the novel was completely thrown out, and Ms. Smith, Anne's bedridden and poor colleague, wanders around Bath - feeding away, as many people seem to do. It does not seem that the personal strength and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused him to love Ann in the first place, was written in the Robert Ruin Robert Robert Winrith film. Siran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey much more insight than P-J. All in all, the 2007 version was disappointing. He seemed to limit the novel to Melodrama, a dance dancer of value in debate. If they want to introduce our modern emotional work into the work of Austin, they have to do what they do by adapting Shakespeare: adapting it to the present. At least "The Bride and Prejudice" was taken out of the historical and local settings and was fun to watch, as was "ignorant". This was not persuasion, but they did not know what to call it.
