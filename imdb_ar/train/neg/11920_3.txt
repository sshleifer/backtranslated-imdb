Oscar Wilde's comedy about literature, perhaps the most intelligent play ever, is shattered by second-rate actors. Sanders, as one would expect, brilliantly, brilliantly in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the team makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crane tries to focus on stages in alternate sentences and other members of the team seem to think that this is melodrama and not comedy; in fact, the whole production contains ends that reduce the tragedy - Hayes' office certainly insisted. It seems that the trend of Breminger lies mostly in making sure there are so many servants, and even the music looks ordinary. Adhere to the visually perfect silent isolation as directed by Lubitch or even the 2004 version of Helen Hunt as Erlen; or try reading the play for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
