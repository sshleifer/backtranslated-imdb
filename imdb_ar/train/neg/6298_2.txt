The terrible story (Ames at its worst), the meaningless "self-conscious" degeneration, the clear shock tactics and the unaccustomed representation, this film (instead of "Rancid Aluminum") all made a mistake in reviving the British film which boasted a lot . Humor is, at best, a limp, ambitious whole set (including a kind of "terrorist group on the Internet" - oh, how contemporary) really starts to grate. <br /> <br /> The final summary - a half-baked attempt to be "edgy" that no one likes. Still, it is always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
