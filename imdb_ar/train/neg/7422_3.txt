Well, I could have gotten into this plot, but maybe only me. The movements of the camera are sometimes unambiguous, yet this film has got a charming vintage quality. The acting act is sometimes real and amusing with an occasional chase sequence involving little-dressed ladies, which were nice. Its climax is confused and disjointed, but still ... Mistaken in the installation, Thanx of Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Thrilling works are interesting, especially because of the 1970s Las Vegas background. There are some jerky portable camera movements at the end, which keep me guessing, for a while. But I do not think I will hunt down the DVD, yet.
