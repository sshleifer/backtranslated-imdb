I went to see this film hoping to see some flashes of Jet Li that we were amazed at in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, many of the stunts of the fight are so blatantly fake that they even took this enjoyment. The kicks will be more impressive if you can not see the wires hanging on it and it flies in the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Caricatures are very disappointing.
