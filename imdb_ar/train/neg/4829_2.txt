As a normal film monitor, I can not say I enjoyed watching this movie. It is not very emotional for drama, it does not capture excitement, and it is not too fast for any action. In addition, some moments of the film are hardly credible. Well, I understand, the soldiers are out of their mind, but it's hard to believe that someone would risk his life, steal the car in the middle of a hostile city, and after the professor's wife screamed, without asking a question. It may seem terribly romantic if it is moving graphics or so, but it is supposed to be a serious film about the war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture gives the impression that it's just a preview of a film that needs to be done. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to have wanted to create a picture of a brave and passionate soldier, but all these "curves" of his own science seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This image left a question in my head: Why? Why did they give her Oscar? Why six? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
