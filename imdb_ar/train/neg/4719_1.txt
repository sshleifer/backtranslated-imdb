I just want to say that this production is very unilateral, it breaks the necessary neutrality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits for the people you met, so you can not have a clue as to whether they deserve to be heard. <br /> <br /> The story is told from just one point of view. Doing so is very dangerous, because future generations learn the bad idea, and that is why wars continue to emerge. I know that this is not the only cause of wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but you've read it in the Internet a lot before. Balcans are as complex as human history.
