The coolers begin on a cold, dark storm night as a bus of three passengers leaves a bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a university professor Howard Conroe (David Fowl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie) Pennington. Inside they discover they lost their bus and stopped working at night. In the waiting area, they find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleepless woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimons) who is currently suffering from a nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in the indoor pool Lindsay encounters and friendship with a young man named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time he sees Lindsay Bailey snorkeling in the pool and then disappears in the air apparently before it pops up. Soon after Lindsay discovered that Billy Water had died in a diving accident five years ago ... Lindsay woke up and told others about her nightmare. Everyone responded by saying that they too had had some disturbing dreams recently and decided to share them for the time. .. <br /> <br /> The next is Mason, who tells the story of how he and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) & Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are terrifying during a camping trip ... <br /> < And then, Sharon is talking about his story with a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delphinthal) who talks to him, and at no time at all Tom is on her front door but he actually turns into a vampire ... <br /> < > Rooney then came and described how He discovers that he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he brings the mass murderer who executed Nelson Coulder (Bradford Paul) back to the deadly life ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conro tells the story of how two of his students brought a god The old war of the Aztec known as Ixpe (Kimberley Harpo) ur back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then return to the bus station for another (predictable) development ... <br /> < Daniel Boyd Chilers is one of the worst horror selections I've ever seen in my life and I usually love this sub genre. The Boyd script lacks what is needed for films like Chillers to work, and you can see the last glimpse come a mile away and each story is really lame. The first thing is useless and does not seem to have an end. The best thing about these anthologies is the short short stories that are rounded with an elegant touch. The second story is predictable, and again, just ending without any reward. So continue throughout the refrigerants that each story is very satisfactory to watch and have no reward to do so. Personality and dialogue are poorly written, and the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own as the film completely absorbs. At least, every story does not last at all, and I liked the idea behind link clips. <br /> <br /> It is clear that director Boyd was working on a very low budget and shows that. All I can say is whether you want to watch a short 15 minute story that was completely placed inside a pool, then Chillers for you. Stories are not smart or scary or have any kind of tension or accumulate for anything. Having said that it contains some nice scenes and some amazing efficiency shine at times. Violence and wisdom do not happen much in refrigerants, torn heart, broken head, blood-filled hand as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically, refrigerants are technically bad things that will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and under average production values. Chillers also feature one of the worst-ending songs ever. The representation is also very low. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'll do a lot of work in the coolers as a low budget movie and at least try filmmakers so I'll credit it at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking about it nonsense. (1987), Cripshaw (1982) and Tales of Darkside: The Movie (1990) is much higher than the coolers until (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973) Watch one of these instead.
