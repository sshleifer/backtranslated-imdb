Well, I had to sit on the computer and write the review immediately after watching this pond. why? Because I must let you all know how bad this film is. It's incredibly bad. Just to allow you to show how bad the situation is, I'll give you a little detail about the film. During scenes of chaos, usually consisting of people shooting or kicking zombies, they cut scenes from a video game. Yes, you have heard me correctly. This film really sucks. In fact, it makes me think of the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to go to the theaters these days. And to see corn full of waste like this? There is no story to talk about and the film basically has nothing to offer but the usual shots and really cheap killings. I am very disappointed with this, knowing that I have seen it. Well, I dumbstruck. It's so bad I can not even find the words. Rating: 0 from *****.
