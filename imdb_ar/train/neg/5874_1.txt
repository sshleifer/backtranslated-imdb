One of the worst movies I have seen so far. The pathetic scene and bad representation also do not help. The only good point is Gary Bossi's parts but that does not raise the film much. She lives up to B movies and passes the test in flight colors. A waste of my money although I found it interesting to start my series a few hours later. I do not recommend this movie unless you see it for free or a gift. (Gift you can request and send receipt for full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10
