I bought this video at a very cheap price, believing that the cover looks very nice. It was nice, but the film is trash. I can handle B-grade, and sometimes I enjoy a good B game (for example: "Surf Nazis Must Die" is a classic example of how to entertain this genre), but this was just really cute. Incredibly boring scenes were dismantled by cheap good porn and horror horror series. This film has very little to offer.
