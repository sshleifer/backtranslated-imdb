Bingo is the game, nonsense is the name. Screen has rarely been stigmatized by such an explosive dodging of half-baked conspiracy theories, Protestant wisdom, and recent words. The bulk of the story is located in the resort of Festori, a Christian resort in the Peruvian Forest. Reindel meets Thank Tolkien with the planet Baku from Star Trek, inhabited by poor followers of a culture of love and peace that is not surprisingly spectacular. Thanks to the stunning design and stunning design (the rainbow color perception of mysterious mysterious "energy"), "The Celestine Prophecies" look like a "Twilight Zone" episode that was ignored in the 1980s. The factual errors relating to the history of the Church and the names are many. I can not believe that Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. It may have been made without his consent, like Bowfinger. The Lord may have mercy on the director, screenwriter, author of the novel and the poor souls who watch the film or read the book.
