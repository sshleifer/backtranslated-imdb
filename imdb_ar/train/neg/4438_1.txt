I borrowed this film from the library and I think it might be good. To what extent are you wrong! <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie I have to write about. Mira Sorvino is very bad in the film, and it is very painful to see the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this film, she is not at all attractive, but I must witness her strange attempt to seduce almost all other major characters. It is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of the film is very humorous and lacks the truth of humor that then makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Failure completely.
