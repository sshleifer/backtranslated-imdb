Now, I rented this film because Brad Dove was in it. It's an excellent actor, awesome in everything ... except for this movie. I think this was just because he realized how stupid this film was and was not bothered by the good performance. This film is an unintended comedy. Some lines crack me up. And for some stale lines, Tobe Hooper seems to just throw lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! Btw bad plot! But it is one of those films that are TaT BAD that have really painful to watch. I recommend this only to BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any other actor, because the plot is pathetic.
