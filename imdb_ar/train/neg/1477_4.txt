I've seen Dolemite and also Avenging Disco Godfather, two other good works of Blaxploitation law from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (also known as Dolemite 2) will always occupy a special place in my heart. For the sense of vanity, the lack of skill in film production, and the sheer enthusiasm (frankly a bit too much), can not top the Human Tornado. <br /> <br /> The opening scene determines the tone. Our old friend Dolemite roams with a white woman, when some local police officers raided the house for no good reason, do not you know that! Women in bed with ol 'states are just a sheriff's wife. Crying when she sees: "He made me do it!" Dolemite Cry: "& $ * @ $ Are you real ???" Accuracy was never his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? Irene Hudson (from Ghostbusters fame), continuity errors (characters looking one way in one shot, the other in the next picture, Dolemite suit that changes colors in every single shot for his night movie), demon Queen Bee eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the guy really think he looked great in this film? I certainly do not know the reason, but you have to admire the great enthusiasm he enjoys. Whether he is jumping completely naked from a slope, or orders barking to his gang in a rhyme (for example: fast in the cave! I have a plan to let that mother $ * @ (% dig his grave!) Sure, he walks in the sea, never happens more than At any time in Kung Fu, the climatic battle is filmed at high speed, but the Axals slow down to let Rudy come up and hit his teeth, not sure whether they want it as if they rushed in the film as an effect or if they really want us to believe it was so fast. , "Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, much like the original Dolemite is an incompetent film with its dimensions For him, but at least interesting, and certainly you have to give credit to these people for this effort, not just a lot, enjoy a hearty my recommendations.
