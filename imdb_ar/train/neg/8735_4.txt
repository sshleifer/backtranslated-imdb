This kinda movie let me down. It looked like a Jaws movie when the hopper told the mayor to close the gardens, it was like when Roy Cheddar asked the mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way summer! But the fund says Hopper should enter into the mind of a murderer and think like him. But he really does not do anything interesting or very exciting. I am not quite convinced that he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they will solve this issue. They just say let's do the police work and we'll solve it. And what's up with all the older men with the cues gathered. I did not even think they were mob bosses. Then the man who was suspected that the mob had chosen them to deal with finding the killer. With his haircut hundred dollars and he thought that Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on what raw lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in other films. I have used this movie and will not buy it again. I suggest you skip this movie. It was funny to see the microphone on top of the scene where the hopper came out for coffee.
