Stephen what I've done has reached a new low. It is strange that Stephen's last shadow man was directed by the same director who made the trash. Shadow man was good, this was so bad from the demons that he was not funny. Stephen barely in the film and feels like in good appearance and when in the film he is called half time anyway. As for the good action, let's just say that the Wizard of Oz has had a greater impact than this garbage, there is hardly any activity in the film, and when it finally arrives, it is boring to depressions that were filmed so badly in so-called motion scenes. Sikal hardly kills anyone unlike his movies where he goes to where he goes to the army of one man, that is under siege 1 and 2 and out wounds. The plot is very confusing with many plot holes that do not make scenes at times. The journey of anger is the best of what a shame I spend 5 pounds on this trash 0 out of ten better luck next time
