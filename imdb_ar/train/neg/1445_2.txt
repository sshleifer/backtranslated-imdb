Okay. Not a bad film industry if it is the original script. But it is not! <br /> <br /> Any part of "There are no women in this story, except Haggard's Introduction by Foulata and Gagoola", was not understood by producers, directors and writers? I mean, it's a simple English language. I understood that at the age of ten! The beauty of KSM is that it contains an amazing description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This must be more than enough for even the most humble producers to work with. But, nooo, they throw "romance" in it. Pathetic. Proposal for all poor souls who thought this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until Peter Wannabe comes and "does it right", you can also read and read again. BTW, there is a sequel book (actually pre-quel) called Alan's wife. It gives a background to the Quatermain story. It is a bit creepy but good.
