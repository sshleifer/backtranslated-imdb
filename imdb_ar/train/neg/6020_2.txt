I love end of days movies. I love B movies. I hope you like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, the often awful music, and the disturbing lines. I can ignore the unexplained events, the fact that the film constantly depends on deus ex machina is an excuse, given the subject. I can ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it is just simple and simple boring. Nothing happens in fact; almost all the scenes in the film are designed to push the ethics of filmmakers to viewers, at the expense of a coherent story or virtually any kind of thrill. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This film is only boring.
