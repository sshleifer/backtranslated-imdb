I am very confused. What in the world was this film about? What was the killer motive? I looked very angry, but I did not know why. Nothing in this film is logical. The depth was zero. Or less than zero depth. Which I think will make it a hill. Or pile. Of crap. The acting was terrible. When I searched for a few actors in this film, they were in very few things I heard about, and it was not a surprise at all. I can not tell whether I feel sorry for them because of the embarrassment of being in such a bad film, or feel they should never have another job in acting. Starting. . . right Now! (Signal Seinfeld.) Really, do not waste your time with this. There is so little material that there is nothing even just to ridicule them. This was undoubtedly one of the worst tortuous clicks - no, one of the worst clicks of any kind, which I suffered from my misfortune to watch, and I've seen quite a number.
