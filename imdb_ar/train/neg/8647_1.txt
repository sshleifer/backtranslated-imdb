Amateur in extreme. The camera works in particular - documentaries do not need to rotate all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really incorrect and the representation is worse. Moreover, the story is disjointed and convoluted - with some sudden holes in logic. At one point, bullets hope to be thrown in prison to rub shoulders with suspected al Qaeda operatives, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found the story totally unreliable due to many flaws. The role of the director / pioneer really depicts a stupid, stupid child. The only thing that really matters to us is that filmmakers actually did movies on the site. It is truly shameful that they missed their chance to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this nonsense?
