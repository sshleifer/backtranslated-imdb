Without a doubt, the worst film I have seen for a long time. I have endured to the end because surely there must be something here, but no. The plot, when not dealing in cliches, rushes to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that is supposed to be the street is simply a breakthrough. Characters never develop beyond the graphics; the set of pieces is clich√©. Worse, given her co-director, photography is just that. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that bring this along with Get Carter or Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are an elusive road; the saints' lives lack innovation, not to mention their depth and shadow. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor is likely to cut it down to a short 30-minute period, but for the moment, it's a million-pound film project; walking and bloated with its own excuses. Getting funding (certainly just because of Rankin's name) while struggling with other small films for money is frustrating for the British film industry.
