CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> During the visit to Rome, a noble nobleman (Nino) Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young Libertine (Daniele Gubert), but their unlikely relationship is opposed by the wealthy father of Castellnovo (Massimo Cerato), and Fat makes a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> Sex love is a swinging sixties story, quoted From a literary source, "La Dame aux Camelias" by screenwriter Michael De Forest, directed by Radley Metzger, with the likes of Ross Meyer and Joe Sarno, with redefining the features of "adult" cinema throughout the 1960s and 1970s . Using the scale format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of "la dolce vita" is rich in visual attraction (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual frankness of the film seems disturbing according to modern standards. The production values ​​are good all the time, and the performances are attractive and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are not forgotten), despite the poor dubbing after synchronization. Although set in an undetermined future, the designs of the Enrico Sabbatini replica set strongly determine the location of the film during its period, and the degree of wah-wah music of Piccioni became an element of exploitation cult. In the end, the CAMILLE 2000 is an excellent taste, but the elegant erotica lovers will not be disappointed with the director. Next to Metzger was Lickerish Quartet (1970), which many consider his best film.
