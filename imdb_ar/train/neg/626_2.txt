The spirit of the geek in high school slaughtered revives Scarecrow who avenges everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. He has a gorgeous looking monster, and has some good effects for the low budget, some ambience but he manages to shorten the circle of goodies with bad ones. Halfway through, I began to move forward and then move between the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems of this movie are many. The first to take a look around thirty is however assumed they are in high school. You do not believe anything from the beginning to go as a result. Scarecrow, while looking great does not exceed that much. He says one of the stupid lines and moves in a more designed to be funny and then scary. Is this a comedy or a horror film? It is a problem that goes beyond a lot of dialogue and preparation. It seems to send over every clich√© of a heartwarming horror film. I expect some of the film has been produced for a very narrow audience in mind, and fans of horror who would like to ridicule this kind rather than embrace it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good-looking monsters, it is a movie to avoid. Even if you receive it in a box for less than $ 5, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid them.
