(Note: Spoiler warning, as it is!)) <br /> <br /> First, this teen flick - a type of Spam-In-A-Cabin, said Joe Bob Briggs. If you are looking for a Roshambo, this is not the case and will not be. I'm not much bothered by the stink in her film work or in directing or making presentations. <br /> <br /> Second, this was not Zunega's first film, it was her first appearance on the screen, cinema, television, whatever. For what it deserves; no Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katharine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Third, you have to make even the lame flick props. It certainly follows the very degrading normative message of this kind: a young woman who has an interest or is interested in sex is beef in a hoof, and it is time for harvest now. <br /> <br /> With this exception, this person gives a sweet, heroic protagonist as well! Now there is a modest teenager death film that has the courage of his convictions! It is interesting that this was said to be the only Ingens movie. The film "One Blow Another Wonder," except for this term, which is credited with much credit. <br /> <br /> (Again, this film is likely to be one of the highest percentages of the representatives of one film in history.) Of the nineteen accredited actors, thirteen were never shown in any other film, three of them In one film by other producers, only one other besides Zunega has six screen credits.What was this, was the mutual aid community never been?) I was granted, I've seen it for a long time on Cable late at night when I'm bored and never expect to be bored in my life again, but I see no reason to pursue all those involved and throw them in Ge with Joan. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
