At present, it is common to look at all the performances from the early 1990s as classics (people are easily blinded these days), and while some of these performances were good / no doubt, this show is pure nonsense. I watched this show a lot in those days since I got a lot of re-runs on TV at the time and even when I was a kid I did not like it. Even the 8-year-old can see how much people are overpowered by Power Rangers and how much foreign currency has been absorbed up to that time. When the show does not resort to painful scenes of "fighting", it strikes the opera audience with unnecessary soap around a group of teenagers who have few social problems from time to time. I do not know about you, but I have not recently given mice anything of this at all, and basically stuffed it up so they have to "fight" some dude again in the costume of a very foreign cliche with fireworks or a game. -Robot. You will never feel "entangled" in this kind of presentation with this show, and the fact that most actors act as if they have no interest at all besides that they are only conservative and reinforce the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There's nothing really memorable about this show, and surprisingly it got a lot of occasional results (Beetleborgs is a good example). Everything is just a quick way to earn some money though. I challenge any "fan" to tell me what exactly highlights the episodes that are supposed to be very good because I could not find anything attractive to the kids. I think most Power Rangers will tell me I do not understand them anyway, or something on that line. I really do not care; this was nonsense at the time and is still nonsense now.
