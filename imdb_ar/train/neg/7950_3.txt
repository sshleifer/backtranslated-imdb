The Lumière Café is a beautifully photographed contraption. Familiar with the director's work, I am well versed in the film director he is supposed to praise - Ozu Yasujiro. While he did not approach Ozzo in greatness, Hu did not convey the depth of Ozu's emotion and his focus on meaning within a closed space. One thing that is completely missing is Ozu's interest in personality - we are not even "introduced" Hou to his leading personality (an ideal blank page). There are no medium or close shots of his people. A DVD add-on presents interviews with actors and gives us exactly what he did not - a good look on their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a wonderful Spanish film for Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates into something like "Nothing Happens Ever". This will be a much better title for this futile exercise. During the film, we got clues about a mysterious Taiwanese composer hearing some of his works on soundtracks. But clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. Unless you are a trainee, this film has nothing to recommend.
