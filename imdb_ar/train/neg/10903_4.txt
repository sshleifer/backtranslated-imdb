Rob Schneider is the famous comedian cause for his movements, face and performance of "Not Humans". This time the animal is. Marvin is the loser who tries to be a hero and a day, no one receives a call from a man under attack, so Marvin must take the case and save the man who was attacked. But on his way to the scene of the crime, his car was broken and badly damaged. He does not remember what happens, and on the next normal day, his life is not the same when he discovers that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character was trying to reach her but his attempts were useless. She played the role of Colin Haskell. There are no negative characters. Negative personality is fate if you can use this metaphor. Marvin must know how to become a normal human again. By the way, his animal instincts, help him in some cases. Sneijder's performance is so. The film is so unrealistic that it gets stupid at some point, but it is one of those films, which is called stray fun as I wrote above. So I saw him in the monkey style of Rob Schneider, but it's certainly not one of the best comedy movies ever or one of the best movies that Sneijder showed. He's a great comedian but that's not his best film.
