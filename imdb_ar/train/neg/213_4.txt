Yes, in fact, it could have been a good movie. Love biangle, (sorry for the poetic license, but not a triangle!) Said an interesting story, unfortunately bad. The picture is sometimes strange, and sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow. Sound needs more attention (usually in Roman films), sometimes light and color filters are chosen poorly. The soundtrack is short and does not help in motion. About acting ... sorry but the best actress is her. Others behave incorrectly and can not convince the viewer. The act is poetic when it is real and realistic when it is poetic. It is a picture of adults, told by children. Just care if very inquisitive.
