After about twenty minutes of this film, I felt really bored. Quite simply, these characters were rather boring. From time to time, something interesting may happen, but then things will slow down again. Fortunately, patience was rewarded in the end, and the end of the film was not bad at all. However, it was not good at all to justify sitting during the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film was modest in general, and given all the talent in the crew, I call it a disappointment.
