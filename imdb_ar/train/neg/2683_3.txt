Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of Beverly Hills figures were thrown in a Thai prison? If so, this is your film. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be fine, but the story was poorly executed. Misrepresentation of fabricated plots, bad dialogue and unresolved issues. This little film did not earn the right to be as hidden as it ends. Potential spoiler and unwanted plot line - Fu tension is full when the hotel employee discovers that the girls do not have a room there and are about to be kicked out. (This moment is played inappropriately as seriously and dangerously as the one at which they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the hotel employee was found himself somehow, and Bangkok is a big city, lest you, I've been there and witnessed against the girls, as if my two free wife from Mai Tais had been sentenced to 40 years in prison. Come on. Rent another day in paradise instead.
