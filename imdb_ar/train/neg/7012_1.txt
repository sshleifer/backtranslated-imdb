My friend and I went to see this movie as a "surprise premiere" which we bought on a ticket to preview a movie before opening it here in Denmark. We sat during the first hour or so and then we left! The aim of the film seemed to be just a depiction of the era (and Club 54), but it did so at the expense of personal evolution, none of which were, and there were few. /> I was rarely indifferent to the characters in the film! <br /> <br /> Although the music was good. So, if you want to hear some good music and get a fix for this 1970s mood, I think it's ok. But do not expect to get a piece of believable characters. <br /> <br />
