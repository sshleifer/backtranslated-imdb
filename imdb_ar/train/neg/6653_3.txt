I've just watched this movie, and I must say it's a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Festad) can not act at all. I read their lines very unnaturally and had very abnormal facial expressions through the entire film. Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is normal. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it several times before. They explode, find another, tease, explode with the other girl and end up together at the end. There were no surprises at all, one knew that Eva would break up, and Adam would "connect" with Petra. The only thing no one saw was that Petra ordered Adam to chase Eva at the party. She became serious, a side of Petra that was not seen earlier in the film, and asked him to win Eva's return, which was really nice. He is a solo actor performing an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> This is an average-level movie with modest actors, so I would not recommend it!
