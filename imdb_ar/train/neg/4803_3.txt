Adrian, you must get a life free of Mr. Brady. I was annoyed and was one of the main reasons that made me know more about the program. It is a mindless display, and every little argument or controversy seems to be placed within range and analyzed to death. This makes her look / sound that she is only willing to marry, however, I know that these differences are all part of life. I think some people this is entertainment. If this happens next season, I'll feel sorry for anyone who has nothing to do with his life but watch this garbage. Although I will not be terribly surprised. Can not even stand commercials for this show anymore! I hope they get enough money to embarrass themselves constantly in front of the camera week after week. However, the girl "A" has one of the big butt!
