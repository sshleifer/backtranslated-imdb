After seeing the "zombie revolution" starring Dean Jagger in the future, she left me one inspiring question. How was the society that created these ultimate warrior combat machines ever defeated in the first place? <br /> <br /> This is the question you will consider if you take the time to watch the zombie revolution. Near the end of the First World War, the French discovered a cult from occupied Cambodia where these unstoppable creatures, which can not be stopped by firing, are a group of monks who go to the top and expel the Hun. <br /> <br /> This scares the living feces of all concerned so an international mission is created to learn how to destroy the mystery of these zombies so that no country can get their hands on it and the world will rule. <br /> <br /> But we got some opposition in those ranks. The first is the evil rising villain Roy Darcy who killed the Buddhist monk who has the secret and the second is Dean Jagger. The power is ultimately aphrodisiac as we all know he is determined to attract Dorothy Stone away from his rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea of ​​how this happens, especially since the zombie race did not conquer the world for one country. Dean Jagger, an Oscar winner for Twelve O'Clock High, must tremble every time he thinks about this film and the terrible dialogue he tried to give a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The ethics of the story, you may make a final warrior using the zombie dose and the zombie chime, but you can not make a slave finally love.
