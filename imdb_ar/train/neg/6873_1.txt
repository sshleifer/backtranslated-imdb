TV productions at the beginning of 2000 were weak and bad. Before signs such as Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk, television has not yet had the right blow, which could attract the attention and interests of viewers in the second millennium. Titles such as Relic Hunter, Mutant X, The Lost World, Sheena, or even Baywatch Hawaii were not encouraging you to watch and follow, or at least they were not all as attractive and interesting as the time before. (Special Unit 2) is no exception. In fact it is a game of men in black meets parody of X files! (As if this were Special Unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; it does not work well. He was promising. At that time there was some saturation of the "supernatural" cases after ten years of many X files already, so the natural soul ridiculed it so wrongly (imagine Mulder as a female minister!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or was strong when it came to making a scientific presentation comic. It was very silly, for every dramatic case, for example, had to turn into a disgusting situation. I enjoyed this bad taste. (Michael Landes) was unattractive and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with Alexandra Lee, as well as any supposed sexual interest, was all weak. The show certainly had a funny appearance, but in general it was unusual. Obviously there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other Ivan Katz's work as co-author and co-producer (seven days) before or (24) later this should be a low point! Despite the distinguishing features, she managed to be a silly teaser for most of the time. So if there is a goal, they have made one of the most pleasant things already! Indeed, it would be rare for us to be thankful to cancel a show after only 19 episodes!
