High Slaughter is intrinsically your bright flick 80s. A joke out of control leaving the geeky guy horribly burned. After a few years the geeky guy returns and starts killing people who hurt him. Now the story may look very exciting and fun, but what makes this terrible film quite different from the rest of the eighties from the bright apes is that it contains some flaws and mistakes of a lifeless continuity. <br /> <br /> The representation is appalling, however, in fact not as bad as one might suspect. Although it does not help to be every character in the film is very misleading and undesirable. Leadership, Carol Manning (Caroline Monroe) is more easily tormented by all of them, which we assume we assume that we share in empathy and root. Not to mention that the eccentric genius is almost too mad and I think even the geeks themselves will be madly mad and will be afraid of screaming about how wild he is. So when he gets confused, does anybody really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unintended laughter. Monroe's lack of talent is very clear, placing her at the bottom of the rest of the cast. However, the most entertaining is when the film tries badly to put Monroe, who was in her mid-30s at the time, as a teenager among a group of teenagers. Then when it comes to later life and Monroe plays about her real age, the rest of the team does not pass like adults. All this goes well with a theme song quietly forming a heavy metal irritation accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a screaming voice "I'll get you". With that in mind, Slaughter High is not really very good, but it has the value of bad cheese. This may be necessary for fans of hardcore fans, but do not expect a dilemma, suspense or credibility. terrible!!!
