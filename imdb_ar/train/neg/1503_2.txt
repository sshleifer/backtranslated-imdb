This is unreasonable! Vidani (who was also spiritually) was one of the cheapest filmmakers in the world. The film stole the original title of Lyon's "Duck you sucker!" But tell the boring story of the Benkerton factor against the killer "Tista de Ferro" (Gordon Mitchell, an unlikely businessman). All that is poor and crazy in this whale is depicted in the landscape cherished in Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Vidney was not able and able to innovate at the same time. In the story there was a kind of crazy irrational things (like the discussion in Sheriff's house and the rough appearance of Butche Cassidy! ") Terribles nuit americaine, comporaments Silly, illogical plot, bad representation and fugace appearance by one of the most rewarding announcers in the story of Italian television, RENZO ARBOR Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski .Yes gorgeous and wonderful, but I'm sure he was only for money and playing with the iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... I DO NOT miss her !!!!!
