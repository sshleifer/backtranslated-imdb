Well, how is this for the original - this means that a rich old man leaves his legacy to his adult children, all of them losers not grateful, and two creepy servants, provided they spend the week at his old nervous house. What happens that night will surprise only those who have never seen a movie or television show before. After a series of killings in which the victims seem to bleed the ketchup in the restaurant, we have a clear and painful end. The cast is led by some respectable actors once they must be desperate for their salaries. There are also a few second-rate actors that were rising at the time but have forgotten it for a long time now. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery in an episode of the movie "Matlock". I will credit the place where it is due - the closing scene is clever and enjoyable, if you are still awake.
