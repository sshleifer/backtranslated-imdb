I think I have seen worse films, but that may be because I felt very upset about the level of these horror movies. The killer wild thing is really bad, he's basically a man in a green suit. There are far worse things to do with B, but do not think for a second that this was a great thing, no. In fact she had a conspiracy with substance, but was still very stupid. Basically its just a bad budget horror film. But at least not as bad as the giant, this film absorbs the balls, this film only absorbs. Blood seems really fake in this film. This one complaint I have for every new millennium horror, low-grade Gore, looks stupid. The scene of a good bloody death with fake blood is really stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
