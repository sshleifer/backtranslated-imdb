Unfortunately, realism is boring. I thought that this film would never end, it would have been better if all the characters were to be in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need it? While bleak as a COMBAT shock, asking for a dream and a nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is almost as amusing as any of the dark movies mentioned. While unwarranted cannibals may make the hearts of Jeffrey Dalmers a little faster race, they were not as interesting as the game RAVENOUS. Really, they found it as interesting as late-night commercials, and exciting for a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to bear this, otherwise, no one. I was really surprised that this type was not made by people in Brain Damage because that was the quality of the dead creatures.
