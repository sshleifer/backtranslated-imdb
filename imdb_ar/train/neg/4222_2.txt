For those of us who lived during those weeks of filming in the city and around the valley - lest we forget the hard days of road closures and "filmmaking". To remind those who live here - include the languages ​​of Boulder Creek, Bunny Dunn, Davenport, Big Bassin. etc. The bank was the BC fire station. The scenes included chasing the Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most friendly, and Matt Broderick was above us all - until then. As far as the movie goes - joke from the script and even the biggest laugh with respect to representation and plot - but who cares at this level. Capsule is a nice time for those who enjoy the views of the coast and our valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes: Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - Old Erba's parking lot was the city square, and the backyard shots were outside Grove Street in Boulder Creek closed the lid of thinking and watched some actors in their early days.
