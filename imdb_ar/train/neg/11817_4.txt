Scifi film is pretty average. The plot was more or less clear from the beginning. Although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very vulgar, using ideas from many films. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: Scientists working on a research platform in deep space are saving a fighter from collapsing in the red dwarf they were circling around them. On board they found a stagnant pod, which was accidentally disrupted at that very moment. After two or three minutes of waking up the man in the incubator, you realize that he is completely insane. Something that completely escapes the crew of the 3-person research ship ... <br /> <br /> After that, every other movie involving a madman becomes terrifying of innocent victims, and I generally think that Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I did not consider it a good film either. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, I took out the foreigners and they saw it again. <br /> <br />
