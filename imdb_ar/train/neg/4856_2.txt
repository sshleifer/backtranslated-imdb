For the life of me I can not understand the blind noise and dedication in this film is absolutely incredible ... ... I think I have the qualifications to say it .... I am a former soldier in special operations with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ... was This film is completely unrealistic and written clearly by someone who has done little research into life in the army or in combat or at the level of a team or platoon. <br /> <br /> Three men of explosives explode around Baghdad alone ????? Get Real ... No Chain Driving ????? Get Real ... EOD Buildings ?? Get real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Pak Sergeant Buck ???? Get Real .... Wait ... You killed a bad man and then killed two people and then took me without firing another bullet or injury at all ??? Get Real .... I steal an Iraqi civilian, while I am armed with only a mile, break into another civilian house, and his wife from his wife, and then prepared him to the camp on foot in central Baghdad at night without that zero or confrontation ??? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no obligation to the military protocol and there is absolutely no resemblance to any military unit you have encountered. Incredible and respectful EOD men and women who disagree with this poor film are not savage adrenaline looking for Jews but highly qualified professionals doing very hard work.
