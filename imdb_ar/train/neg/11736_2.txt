The week before I saw the state of Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, where a student makes a filmmaker and can not decide whether he wants to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa can be the film he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artistic prowess, these two films had a good development of characters and coherent storylines. Yes. This film stumbles to a false end. I must admit it was consistency. This movie is bad from start to finish and is not worse or better especially in any part. All the actors did their best. Roseanna Arquette deserves the best. They prove to be very talented, very funny and very exciting. But why should they prove it in this alien ball.
