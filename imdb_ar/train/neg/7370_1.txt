I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and although most of them are not great, or even so well, this steam heap has been reduced from the bad movie bar. <br /> <br /> Plot: Not really sure. Something about medicine makes you crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the movie is broken scenes that turn between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about the quality of the character of Seagals "Mashall". <br /> <br /> Acting: Blows. <br /> <br /> Voice Dubbing ,,,,,, What was with a terrible voice overdubbing?! Could they find anyone who looked like Segal? Cheech or Chong may have been editing the audio settings, perhaps they were armed at least at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, and it is completely stupid. Avoid at all costs !!!!
