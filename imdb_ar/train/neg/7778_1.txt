This movie must be the most beast and the most stupid monster over the ages. It's a complete joke that this has even appeared in the theaters. This is like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carden, shame on you. People involved in this garbage pile need lobes. wait! Maybe I'll give them a lot of credit. I'm sure they've been lobotomized before filming. How else can one explain the absolute and transparent stupidity of this bucket of crap? Do not waste a minute of your life watching this. Do not waste your time until sending a review.
