Ben, a policeman from outside the city, is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring her murderer to justice, but he is contacted by Stefan, who believes his sister was the victim of a vile cult. So Ben, the best friend of his sister and Stephan, travels to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> These are second-rate things so terrible and I wonder how they are released. It makes the original "howl" look like a masterpiece. What Christopher Lee was thinking, because it must be the worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a big mistake in this real, award-winning film, ranging from the powerful wooden performances of Annie McEnroe, Reeb Brown, Marsha A. (Such as the year), cheap and lame special effects, misuse of lighting, humor ... If there was any trivial music in the 1980s (with some films focusing only on some unknown bands) , With an ornate orgasm that is a sight to be seen and a stressful story with a flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if this was bad, it would be very funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives of the site and the settings of the film look great, but that's about it ... In fact I'll add a short abstract scene from Sybil as well. <br /> <br /> As the band reinforces that the band is playing its stunning song during a series of strange scenes from the film, the question becomes why? <br /> <br /> Piece of chaos, at least not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
