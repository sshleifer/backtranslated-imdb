Let me start by saying that I have already used to love Betty Gabel, especially from Argentine Argentina, but by the time she reached this disaster, she had "recovered" and frankly the entire film was awkward. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (which must be somewhat desperate) The story was bad, the colors were good, and the film was too long. He had some of the old standbacks like Harry Davenport and Grindiner Gardiner to try to stimulate interest but without success. The musical result was sad, and I have to say that there was no memorable tone in any way .... because I was impressed with Miss Gabler, and I always wished I had never seen this novel!
