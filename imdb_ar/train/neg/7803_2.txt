"Secretary" is one of those "cowards" cowards, smiling, who are being watched on Sunday afternoon, when there is almost nothing else. While the plot (becoming an emotional woman jealous of anyone who succeeds in her office and decides to do everything in her power to prevent them) may be one of a kind, she has realized countless intrigues of plots, perhaps taken from other television films, for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not worried about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in many television films as "mom" or "victim" of violence or abuse, and one has to wonder about the kind of life she lives. In this, I enjoy the joy of playing my mother and the victim of psychologist Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice like a villain. While Sheila Kelly has some good professional moves (singles, break, I think, law and order), she also suffers from a series of pitiful TV movie roles, and this one adds to him only. As for others, I have no clear memories of them, so I must say something. <br /> <br /> This game will play on the Lifetime network (I think that's where I saw it), but do not bother watching it, unless you're bored with words. This will not make you more exciting ...
