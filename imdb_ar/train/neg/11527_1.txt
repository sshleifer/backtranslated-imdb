<br /> <br /> The movie begins as a normal comedy film. It is about the boy who is picked up, has no parents, and madly loves the # 1 girl in school. Nothing surprises in the film, there is nothing you can not guess its appearance in the film. Toby McQuire tells us that either he is not a good actor or that there is no representative in the world who can save a text like this. Children at the age of 10 may be able to enjoy the film but are somewhat violent for their youngest. You can not get away from thinking about movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I went out almost from the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good though is the use of the computer, but this is not something to put into the Christmas tree! So, my recommendation: do not see this movie even if you pay for it!
