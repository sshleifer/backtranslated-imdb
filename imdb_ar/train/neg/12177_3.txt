Since the 1970s, writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction films, fiction and horror. Some are great examples of how to use a small budget to maximize the impact; many of them are very bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> The story of the Terminator mode of travel through time and motion, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth, a future cop looking at the task of tracking down the bad guys of Whistler, who travels to the past by settling the body of a grandfather. Whistler is able to control other humans through his psychic abilities, turning them into obedient zombies ("watchers" of the title), and attempts to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of future leaders. Followed by Jack until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In a 1991 sequel, Jack still lives in 1985. After the destruction of Whistler, he settled and married Lena (Helen Hunt), the young woman who helped him to succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things do not stay quiet for long, and show trouble in the form of Whistler's brother, E. Wardo, who is trying to build an army trancer. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is disappointed with the quality of the original. It's hard to capture a story if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there are lots of impressive actions and some bad special effects. Gone are the creativity and intelligence that made Trancers so much fun. Instead, we get some single lines and a script line that looks like it was typed immediately. <br /> <br /> About the only reason I can offer to recommend this film to the fans of this kind is the cast, which includes many names that will be familiar to the followers of science fiction films and horror: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martin Besswick . Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a "day off" while filming the Trancers II, and the mediocre performances at best. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the Trancers series has its fans; four other sequels since then have been put out. Unless the quality has swung in a huge upside, I can not imagine being good.
