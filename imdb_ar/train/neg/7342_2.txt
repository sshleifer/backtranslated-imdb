"The Man in the Attic" is a film filmed in 1910. Inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story she did not really need to tell. <br /> <br /> Because of the box, the people in charge of the film have tried their best to make the film look full of excitement and excitement. Use terms such as "illicit emotion", "prohibited relationship" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a picture of Patrick Patrick (Little Doogie Howser, M.D.) carrying a gun! <br /> <br /> The story includes Christa, whose role is Anne Archer. She is unhappy married to a man who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Both Christa and Edward end up loving each other. <br /> <br /> The supposed "horrible" part of the film is this: Christa's husband discovers this relationship and prevents them from seeing each other again. So what do they decide to do? Christa ends up in Edward's room upstairs. Wonderful! Christa ends up seeing someone else and Edward feels very jealous. And so on and so on. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not cover any new area. It is an original image of Showtime, which explains why stars are representatives of List B and both briefly appear in an orange. <br /> <br />
