This film deals mainly with Dr. Claw, the most prominent in Inspector Gadget, who returned many years later to the quiet city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to frustrate the tool once and for all by using the latest "crunch" tool to help destroy the popularity of the tool. Sadly, the film failed miserably. The series was wonderful, but it was revived about 20 years later with tragic results. Without a sound Don Adams as the inspector's tool, no longer interrupts; Dr. Claw is not only visually scary, but looks like a wrestler with a cold shot, more than himself scary. Admittedly this is a children's film, but the plot is very weak (I can not mention animation) so much that it dwindles compared to the original series. Someone decided to update Penny as well to give her two decades. She now has a punk-like revolutionary style and does not play half the role she played in the TV series. Gadgetmobile talks, in addition to embedding a plot angle entirely focused on talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved this show that grew up, but I thought the live version was more than the pain I was carrying, but now they go and start this full dilution of the high-quality television series on us. It's more than I can.
