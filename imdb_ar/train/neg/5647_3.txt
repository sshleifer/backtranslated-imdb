We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing ratings we've seen here. I gave it three stars because there is no doubt that acting, directing and writing are sometimes brilliant. In fact they are very impressive and we have not seen the propaganda that has been smoothly transferred to the series. If one sees discrimination, one will see a whole series of extreme right-wing beliefs published by Fox News. To avoid giving up any spoilers, I will refrain from referring to every dozen specific cases. A quick look at the conspiracies here will reveal IMDb that everything from torture to arms control to the right of the network to provide "Infomercials" and invite them to the news is justified with intriguing plot intrigues and enthusiastic speeches delivered by some of the best actors in the world. We saw many offers and finally we surrendered in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzalez as a shining example of why all kinds of torture must be used in the name of protecting all of us. The series also managed to get rid of gay men and women in subtle ways by using them as evil plot tools. All in all a full range of religious far right. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this program will undoubtedly be used by future historians as evidence that America lost its way in the first part of this century. As a student in history myself, I will describe this program as being in association with the publicity produced by Goebbels to Hitler and some of the publicity produced by Hollywood for the American public during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this as an educational tool to help your students understand how accurate advertising can be then by all means. Just make sure you buy an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the extreme wingers at the Faux Network who produced this farce.
