I have seen a lot of nonsense in my day, but good, take a hot rod cake. I saw a free offer in New York the other night. I can only hope that the ridiculous version will appear to the customers who are paying. The big laughs were rare, and the plot was not interesting, and the characters were at least two-dimensional. One of the most striking features is the funny dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and was the only scene that was really laughable. Other than that, I can only remember random and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I expected more from him. But in short, I certainly would not recommend attending a free show or paying for watching this movie.
