The concept of fun, but poorly implemented. Except for the fairly good make-up effects, there are not many. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what appears to be weeks and weeks to move from fat to normal size, the main character seems to be moving from normal to deadly thinness in days ... Once it becomes thin the killer remains very thin by the same Destiny seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film faces far worse problems - cinematography is the quality of a low-budget TV show and, most of all, is terribly beautiful everywhere. It seems that Robert John Burke is always trying to impersonate Charlton Haston's strange and literally painful and watching ... The only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenny and Carrie Woehrer are both worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving this film is that when I enter the movie for the last 1/3 or so and play Joe Mantegna, the film develops a fun feeling, like a ghost slaughterhouse, The madness of torturing the Roma is absolutely very enjoyable. The end, if predictable, is also nice. Avoid unless you are King-o-Phile or you are really passionate about the Fat Tony voice of the Simpsons family who terrorized a Roma camp.
