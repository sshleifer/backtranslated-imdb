The only value in this film is basically to laugh at how bad it is. With the plot making your average middle school writer look good, and behaving almost well, it gets my final score. One of Tom Hanks' very early films where obviously it was not a pleasure to be a real picky. The best special effect of the film consists of a man wearing an incredible rubber monster costume consumed.
