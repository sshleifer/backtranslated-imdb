"Indian burial land": If these three words appear anywhere in the real estate list, look for another neighborhood. A young couple with their young daughter and her young son move to a house in Maine near a pet cemetery and after a hike in the ancient Indian cemetery. It seems that Indian land can return Fido or thin from the dead - if you do not mind getting a monster of hell raving for a pet. It can do the same for the dead - if you do not mind getting a zombie killed around the house. <br /> <br /> Throw in a crowded blacktop of two lanes, speeding big excavators, good faith (if a neighbor is somewhat bleak) and one child does not already get enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what's going on from there - Logical high-level, which offers, in all fairness, even some concerns. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse adjustments than Stephen King (like "Maximum Overdrive," which King also took out). But there are also better ones (like "Salem's Lot" and "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
