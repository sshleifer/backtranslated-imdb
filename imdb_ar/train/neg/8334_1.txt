This has the worst absolute performance of Robert Duval who looks like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His dramatic melodic acting takes away from any great interest. I'm not sure if this is a deliberate or steals intentional scene, but it's the only thing I can remember from a movie you can really forget. This image should appear in each amateur class as an example of what should not be done. Praise be to God, Duvall went to bigger and better things and stopped trying to influence in an intellectual tone. It's a good actor but that's it. Klaus is much better. His performance is silent and remarkable.
