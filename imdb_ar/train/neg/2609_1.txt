This film made nothing new or worthwhile. After seeing him, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply moved it and might be less interested if it was fun. This is a good example of the film "Concept Only" - they have a concept about film and other details are important because execs know that they will make $ $ based on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cruise's exit from prison and his release. No longer hated puppies but programmed to love them - could not simply harm the fleas. This did not last long after her release and she returned to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing aspect of the film was supporting characters. Eric Idel has made me the voice of the Flying Waddlesworth I hate - and this is difficult because I'm deeply impressed with Python. He obviously did it because they gave him a lot of money (there could be no other reason). Tim McInerney, a poorly regarded Crowe, was funny in the Black Adder program but here he was completely lost and made a mistake. It must cost a few dollars to get Gerard Depardieu, but he was also quite bright. There were some other supporting actors as well, but given the bad character writing, I try to keep them from thinking. <br /> <br /> In general, it would be best to let your kids watch TV from the trouble of letting them see this drivel.
