My comments may be part of the spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you are interested enough ... <br /> <br /> The title "Save the Grace" was supposed to be a "paper excuse for old British women to get a high screen" This stupid movie casual music is a nuisance as well as vulgar tunes Which appear intermittently to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I get it!) Thanks to its amazing English position and Brnda Blethyn's overwhelming ability to evoke the audience with its own voice. I can literally hear people in the High Times magazine chanting about the enormous "buds" that are spreading in this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brinda is trying to release her illegal clothes on London Street in stark white dress. Not funny. not original. No interest. Not a good 7.2 rating film is the result of excessive fanaticism. do not waste your time ...
