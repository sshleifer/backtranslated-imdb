***** Caution: may contain spoilers ********* My huge problem in this movie is how the wife is centered about adultery !! After she stood one night with the phantom psychiatrist she was stalking him. Constantly calling and threatening her and sending even a video of their night together. He is very dangerous and dangerous. The problem is that they only think that it is dangerous to the HER (and expose her secret). It was not for a second I thought of a day in her husband's attention! Have you even thought for a moment that he might be in danger of this psychotic? As soon as I realized how rational he was, she had to warn her husband no matter what the consequences. Maybe there was no movie at the time, but there was no film at all, so what's the difference.
