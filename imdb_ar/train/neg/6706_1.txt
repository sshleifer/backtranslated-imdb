I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I remember. I liked it, I showed great potential. I think most people here are criticizing this film because the film looked entangled together (through the same director's confession on the official website - the short film show as "Almost Lumpy"). <br /> <br /> However, it was an easy comedy. I think a lot of people are trying to read a lot in comedy. All they are supposed to do is laugh - that's all. I did exactly that in his presentation, so I succeeded at that level. Only 2 cents anyway.
