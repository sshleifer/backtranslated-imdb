What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth, who specializes in slippery, changed alliances did not change this concept first. He could help highlight the real potential, especially with the interesting personality played by William Bishop. While the film stands, it is in a state of disarray (as confirmed by the Chipe Auditor). The main problems are with the trend, cheap budget, poor scenario. Strength lies in excellent actors and an interesting general concept - characters are drawn in different directions by opposing forces. What is needed is to have someone who has sufficient vision to assemble the positive elements by rewriting the script into a kind of cohesive whole, rather than the vast anarchy of the ribs that they are, (try to discover motives and interact if you can). Also, the larger budget can be matched to contrasting locations and studio shots, and exits sites from the very clear suburbs of Los Angeles. The real shame is the waste of excellent actors - Hayden, Taylor (before covering his teeth), Diner, and Reeves, along with James Milican and William Bishop shortly before their sudden death. Few films illustrate the importance of a more visionary author than this mysterious West, who was, in the right hand, much more.
