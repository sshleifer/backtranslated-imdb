This film has the potential to be a decent horror film. The main character was done properly and I felt sorry for him and there was a great deal of backstory. However, everything else sucks. The filmmaker, Emmanuel, is incompetent in filmmaking. Some of the most stupid shots are used at all. <br /> <br /> - A random sequence of random images scattered throughout the movie. I do not know if he tries to be deep, intelligent and poetic but he is not. He was a fool. Random shots of the trailer experienced by the main character, random buildings, random images of the buildings, random cat who walks away. WTF? And clouds. Lots of dark clouds dark. <br /> <br /> - He really liked this technique of having a cut scene into different shots instead of just being one continuous shot. EX: The guy is trying to shed his weeds and the camera around him. Instead of just one shot, it edits to 10 different shots, so EDGY really! And hip! And clever! Stupid. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible but makes the movie very funny. Scarecrow is a gymnast that causes it to fluctuate, spin and spin all the time. Some deaths would have been better. Expect the main bully to have a long but good death. Corn starch is simple in the ear. The love interest was hot. sensory. That is why this movie gets 2.
