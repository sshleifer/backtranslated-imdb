this is funy. I've seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and found that some of them are very creative and enjoyable, while others are repulsive and tolerant - such a movie. For me, they range from great to nonsense - without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the "cutting edge", but I can only think that much of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made a lot of films very quickly and was tolerant of himself. His gay or bisexual films are often too bad - performed slowly, sometimes very boring (like PETRA VON KANT and THE PETER VON KANT) and sometimes the gross (such a film) is bad very. Can not his message of accepting a person be confused with the sexes better than showing him slapping or watching cattle as they brutally kill? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more humane and sympathetic - then, perhaps, I was interested in movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honestly at this stage after watching this movie that I may not bother any other movies from Fassbinder - it seems that the bad is out of good.
