The progress of the plot is enough for "one intervention" and creates curiosity about the outcome. However, in the end, the feeling remains that the film's producers have forgotten to end it. If the intention is to create a permanent circle (sometimes done in the Twilight Zone), it is very difficult to view it as a positive effort.
