I was expecting to enjoy the romantic comedy that was hip-hop, but I was disappointed at many levels. First of all, the story is recycled very badly to make it unbearable. Secondly, preparation, representation and story are not authentic or credible. Third, there are plenty of good black actors to choose from these standard choices. What about some originality? Thirdly, there were very few hip hop songs that were run in an atmosphere of interest - if any. Nothing really seems central. Overall, the movie was very disappointed, but the editing style was interesting and almost made the film worthwhile.
