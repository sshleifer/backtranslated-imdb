There is no drop of sunshine in The Sunshine Boys, making the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon the only cynical moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which does not depend), balances old age with irrational behavior - and worse, clumsy, distraction, and irrational behavior. Walter Matau is ruthlessly playing the role of an old vaudeville and spoke in a reunion with former comedian George Burns on a private television show (they were said to have been a team for 43 years, asking "How long did it take Voodville last, anyway? "). Burns, the Oscar-winning supporting actor, was in a bad mood for the film 30 minutes later. After that, Matau had already blown the material into hell and back. The more noisy the film, the less tolerant and enjoyable. The director Herbert Ross made a hard work only when he was not associated with one of Neil Simon's films. Here, Ross sets a cuckoo like a thin hawaia, moving away from the belligerent routine that does not bear fruit (such as the semi-coherent matthau that appears in a mechanical garage to be tested in a TV ad). At this stage, Matao was still too young for this role, and he compensated excessively by intimidating him and screaming. It was up to Ross and Simon to calm down the character, to calm his mood to give the Sunshine Boys some sunshine, yet Walter continues to predict as if we were all deaf. The image looks terribly awesome and crawls quickly without its spirit; one loses hope early. * 1/2 of ****
