Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? You can either a) shredded and drop it in the toilet or b) a film based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a difficult future cop in partnership with a rubber dinosaur using terms such as "I did not tend to trumpet" and mulberry strikes based on that This is funny. That's right, you can choose the option that enjoys more merit - dumping in the toilet. <br /> <br /> You should see this. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this film is. So it does not fit into the category of "very bad - it's good". I have already shown it on TV while writing - and while I was watching I felt the need to enter IMDb and record my disgust. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park was thought two years ago, how did they do that on Earth think that the masses would not tolerate a man wearing a rubber suit? The team must simply walk and curse the consequences. Anyone who cares about it will go to hell because of this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm about to collapse.
