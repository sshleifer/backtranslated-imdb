The film was a scene while Nicholson was on screen. However, I had to fight out of boredom when the film was based on Meryl Streep to carry the scenes without Jack. It was as nice as it could be. The relationship between the characters was not distinctive. These characters were filmed before - and much better. It looked like a reality-based scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and unworthy of writing about or watching. Why did Evron feel that her life and her relationship with Karl Bernstein were interesting enough to write about running away from me. Perhaps I wrote it as a remedy - for many writers, putting a ring of their lives on paper is evil. Well: But why did anyone in Hollywood feel that this story deserves photography is still a mystery to me.
