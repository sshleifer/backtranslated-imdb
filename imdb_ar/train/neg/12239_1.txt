Since I was eight, I was an adult wrestling enthusiast. It does not matter what the union saw. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me the procedure was all I saw for it. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. This was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I was expecting another boost for each show. But this time. I was wrong. Instead that night was one of the best wrestlers who came out of Canada, a real person had fallen to his death because of the wrong trick. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened after Owens' death made me very crazy. <br /> <br /> Instead, I finished the pay for each offer and did the right thing as humans decided WWE protected what came first and that was the money by keeping pay-per-view happening as if Owens had never happened. <br /> <br /> I must tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but that was by far the most stupid decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> This is folly when Owen said he wanted the pay method to continue. Give me a break. When a person dies on a pay pyo show her comon feeling to stop him. This is like a police officer shooting a thief or a criminal from running and then letting the man die so that he can go home and call it day as if the life of the man never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no, it matters what happens. Owen will be missed and thank you for your memories at all times provided by us.
