"The documentary", we use the term clearly, that Muslims are trying to control the world violently. Then it is mentioned that any Muslim does not recognize this either that he does not know his faith or lies on your face! Also, every person interviewed in the film found a market for his absurd morality on the reality by selling it to accompany conservatives willing to let others think about them. What the West needs to know is that this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at the pygmies. If you're looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current situation in the Middle East, I'll look elsewhere. Try something that provides multiple views from qualified sources.
