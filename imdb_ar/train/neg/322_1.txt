I have watched this film for about 5 years, and its memories still haunt me to this day. I was quite aware of how awful she was supposed to be, so I could only bear to myself. But like most, I could not believe all the negativity. Being a fan of Sandler, it seemed incredible that one of his films was so bad. I figured he was just a Sandler fan. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even one second on anything funny. This is actually a great achievement. You think in a 90 minute comedy, you have accidentally stumbled upon something so amusing yet. But no, it's terrible. It's not "too bad it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh over how bad it is, you can only cry. Wait patiently for a joke that will make you at least chuckle, but it will never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen The Ring? Where do people watch a video and die after 7 days? If this movie is on the video, people will die instantly, with their hands, there will be a smile on their faces when they realize that their suffering is over, and this will be the first smile since the pressure on the play. <br /> <br /> You may only be tempted to see how bad the situation is, and you can not curb your curiosity. No. please do not. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are two people in the world, those who think Going Overboard is the worst film ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
