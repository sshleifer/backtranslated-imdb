Not that I was really surprised .... The movies are never as good as the books from which they originated. I was looking forward to seeing this film because this is one of my favorite books, although I learned that it is likely to suck it. I hope it is a pleasant surprise. However, they have moved too far from the story of the book, and the copy of the film did not convey the extent of this truly terrible home. The finish was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of very bad plastic surgery. The representation was not noticeable at best. Maybe if a play version is released so they do not have to stay much in the "Making a TV movie" box for life, that would be better. If you see this movie, I strongly encourage you to track and read the book. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
