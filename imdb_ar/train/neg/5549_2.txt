"This may mean the end of white sex!" A general as well as dozens of zombies roam around the battlefields of Europe during the Great War. An exploratory trip begins in the long-lost city of Kenev-Angor, to stop this kind of thing and to keep the battlefields clear for honest white people to kill each other by tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It is a little difficult to determine when people are zombies or not in this film as the representation is extremely wooden. Until 1936, the acting in this film was bad. Of the previous decade. It seems to come from a textbook of correspondence on "how to act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter III: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and hate (female) Hold your hand, place one hand on your heart, open your mouth while yelling, hold another hand, lift your hand against your mouth. 10 seconds, then turn the head at 90 degrees away from the direction of hateful things and sigh. " <br /> <br /> "How can the scene be difficult and emotionally charged with a former preacher to explain your love to someone else Do not touch the eye Do not move Do not show any emotion Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines from the studio wall. "<br /> <br /> To give us a break from the lead actor, the director cuts off at long intervals where nothing happens except that the movie continues to show the projectors. Thus, the story of the 35-minute story is lined up to 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> Zombie revolution when it comes too slow! The armies of the former zombies, released from mental slavery, run their former master by slowly devouring the hilltop and then kind of stabbing the door a bit and smashing the window. "Yes ... Let's ... Oh, I do not know Yeah ... Let's have to destroy Frankenstein-manana." (Although I have discovered something that is symbolically hidden, Jagger is shot by the indigenous people as a kind of cynical contradiction to all the indigenous people who were shot by the Germans at the beginning of the clique.) See, even the oppressed indigenous people do not want the end of the white race! The chase (which you can call) through the rear-view swamp is hilarious and deserves the entry price alone. Roy Darcy has a hell of a time in the camp, but he is completely lost, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting moment in this movie. A cute little montage of aboriginal and zombie members cast a white falling under the evil eyes. Face after face, cross fade into each other. It works, although there is a strange little flash in the middle of every close shot like a window was cut. I think these tires should be 'Neg Cutters' between fading. <br /> <br /> Best seen with friends and in a ridiculous mood.
