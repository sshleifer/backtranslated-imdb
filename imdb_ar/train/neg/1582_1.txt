Arg! This film hurts my head. Not in a good way. <br /> <br /> It may be just my growing desire for this kind of movement, but even when I was a kid when I swallowed a triangle like Navy Seals, I still consider this movie disliked. Now I totally despise her. <br /> <br /> Take a fairly good quick story. Keep the title and throw the rest. Instead, use some half-wielding wrestlers, who are future pacifiers, full of conspiracy holes and all things at risk of collapse (why there is a rebel base in the middle of the ring, what about the cameras?) Why you clearly identified footage of what actually happened in the bakersfeild in a room Unguarded?) <br /> <br /> The entire film screams in the 1980s, from the terrible result to the hideous fashion. love. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie. I know some people liked it, but some people started to urinate and I do not understand them either.
