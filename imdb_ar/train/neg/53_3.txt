I study Catalan, and I am pleased to find El Mar, a film with a Catalan dialogue mostly, in my video shop at the Art House. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I'm not too happy to see him. <br /> <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well made and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it is well behaved and convincing. (For the most part, this is ... Will the Landlords be stripped of a burial chamber in the middle of the town square, with a full view of the 10-year-old's boy?) Well ... the details are simple. Up to this moment, he had a sense of the non-magical cafe maze, which also arose in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Progress is fast, and the three children who survived the opening incident came. At the age of. Francesca is a nun working in the TB clinic, and the boys, Manuel and Ramalo, are both ill. I know, but hey, the coincidence happens. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with many Spanish films (an apology to fans of Almodovar), is that, except for one case (Francisca), characters deteriorate completely *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> Moreover, he descends into an appalling surplus. Be prepared for a lot of pain and lots of blood. The so-called "Butler" is on track. If it was manufactured 40 years ago, the poster would have said: "See forbidden love !!" rape!! killing!! Distortion !! Intolerance !! Cruelty to animals !! betrayal!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make characters and relationships between characters believable. To work, it should have been for many of the last shots to restore the characters. As it is, seems a strange and frustrating split between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If this sounds like something you should see, by all means, enjoy it. I think I'm going to something that does not make me feel like I need a shower to get out of depression and depression. <br /> <br /> As for Catalan, it is the Majorca dialect, which is quite different from Barcelona in dialect, although I was surprised by the comment that even Parsillon apparently needed Catalan translation to understand it.
