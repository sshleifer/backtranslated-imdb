The Lives of the Saints begins with a spectacular view of London as a busy city with busy streets and exotic sunshine. I was hoping to keep this atmosphere, but it is steeped in a story that does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the great Mr. Carva, his poor father, the father of the crime - the father (in the least I think this is supposed to be because he never knew, but he drops the small cats in the fat crowd, so trust me , It is a prick) performs small tasks while his narrow girlfriend confers the functions of Papa. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black man who always rushes from A to B. Even the day he encounters a homeless child almost gives him his desire to be able to stop running. Runner shoots the missing boy in the Othello apartment, where he immediately begins to give more wishes. Wishing to achieve some of his own desires, Carva has a kid kidnap. But he is not sure what will bring him really happiness. Is it a child's innocence again or is it another job? In both cases, I do not want to see the little boy give him second. <br /> <br /> It takes a long time to get there and there are lots of repetitive scenes. The end is trying to be appalling, but because there is no background story about investing in any of these characters, they only work as a version of the bored audience. <br /> <br /> Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend into a kind of religious symbol that ends up being a buzz like hell, ironically. If he gave us something that could be accessed or had at least a better explanation for the characters who suddenly behave in everything strange, it would be a more enjoyable film. As is the case, we have identified a range of disturbing high sounds that seem to be a miracle to develop intelligence when faced by the mysterious boy. Of assets not disclosed. This is just plain anger! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the occasional moments of the atmosphere and temperament, this film has nothing to recommend.
