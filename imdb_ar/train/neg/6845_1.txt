"I went to the cinema, to see" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was kind of" neat "/" Krush Groove "was a flick, and I had no objection / but when it comes to" Rappin ", I drew the line. Send a word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small sample of the rupym-stupa rhymin style displayed in the waste of movie and location permits. This film is seriously shaken (this is what happened in the 1980s just to talk about something terrible). Like Mary, Mario van Peebles is one hell of a representative. As an actor, Mario van Peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> A movie called "Rappin" performed better at the highest level of the time. So why were the 6-year-old traders flocking in the corridors, even on a day when standards were so high that Webster was low? Because this rap is weak. So weak that there is no B.E.T. It will be touched by a 10-foot string of golden ropes. <br /> <br /> "Rapture" from Blondie is a crazy poem next to this piece of Dr. Suss in the cover. So do not be a trick, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
