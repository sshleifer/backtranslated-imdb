If this depends on the real life relationship, as it is assumed, between Mrs. Kerten and Mr. Levinson, I am glad that I do not know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both people take stupid pills freely throughout the movie while playing the song on the floor. Many stupid scenes with people who act stupid do not make comedy.
