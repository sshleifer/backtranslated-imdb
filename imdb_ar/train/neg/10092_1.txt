Bad film. <br /> <br /> First, the movie begins with a policeman and his partner parked outside a furniture store / warehouse. The "bad" cop takes a girl, who has withdrawn from her, to the attic in the warehouse, while a junior policeman sits outside and wonders what might happen there. The "bad" cop returns in the end with a heavy coarse bag. The new policeman does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a crap back, then thinks everything is fine Present). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, even once with a nipple scene (making it a little better). But in the end people began to catch up, which took a long time to see how clear it was. One girl gets a voodoo curse on her only in the event of her death, just like you do. Now, the "bad" cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then gets rid of the coarse-tiled corpse. <br /> <br /> Since she has put on the magic of the oughty, she returns to her many eye shadows, which are supposed to indicate that she may be a coma ... And the curse of magic makes all other girls become "eye shadow monsters". Some girls meet a man, who seems to be a currency specialist, and gives them a ride (apparently natural to him). But when girls see other people, such as a single girl's husband, it is feared to be awful (some people are afraid, but others do not notice) .... a huge plot hole. <br /> <br /> So, to finish the monsters, kill the monsters of the "bad" police eye shadow, which in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the final scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for a sequel! Like anyone wanting to see the 2nd part of this cow dropping.
