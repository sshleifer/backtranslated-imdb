Well, let me say that I've always been a fan of Steven Seagal, and his films are usually fantastic, but that does not suit the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like everything. The biggest reason I do not like is that it is very flawed and my parents do not make sense. The acting is so bad that Stephen Segal does nothing good, and the rest of the actors that I can see because they are directly playing videos only. It does not follow a straight story, everything happens once, and for that reason it makes no sense. There is hardly any action at all, and to make a good action film, you usually need to do it. The special effects are very bad and you can say they are fake. This is all about seagals worse, if you want to watch Steven seagal movie do not hire this demonstration just does not exist. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall result: ** From ********** <br /> <br /> * From *****
