I never fully understood the popularity of Saban Power Rangers, which was just a US version of the super-popular Sendai series in Japan over the past three decades! What was wonderful about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say Power Rangers are bigger but they will be wrong. <br /> <br /> I am sure that if they speak Japanese, they will know how high quality Sendai compares to the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is absolutely awesome, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better view, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
