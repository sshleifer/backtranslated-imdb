I had high hopes in this film. I thought the hypothesis is interesting. I hung it, although I found acting, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, unnoticed. I kept hoping that my time spent would be fruitful, but in the end I was left wondering why they had bothered them until I made that thing. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message worth transmitting. If this film has achieved anything, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic story. I find it hard to believe that his story may be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message "mundane life is worth living" has worked. I would recommend this movie to anyone. 101 minutes of my life get lost.
