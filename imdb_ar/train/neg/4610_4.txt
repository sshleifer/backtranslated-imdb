I watched this movie because I noticed that he had a curry and was ruthless in the film. I have long had a theory about her, she is a talented actress, but she does not seem to prove it, because she is always in this kind of low-budget B movies. It is still beautiful, and it is still trying to act on the unfortunate things I always see in it. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Windt played against writing, and it was so hard that he earned an appreciation for his role. Another note about Ms. Woehrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk significantly since I last saw her. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (most likely) removal of implants. This is not a bad thing. It still looks fantastic. I would like to see her in a better film.
