A boring, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated with chemicals (Wheeler) goes across the country to find his ex-wife and children; in the meantime, everyone is killed on his way with only one touch of his hands. In a dangerous way, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has a non-original premise, but although it can be much better. The end result is just a movie without moments of suspense or sadness. Even a good cast is quite a waste. I give this 4 (four).
