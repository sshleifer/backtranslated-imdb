Alone in The Dark is one of my best favorite role-playing games ever. I remember spending the entire nights in front of the computer screen, trying to escape from this palace and in fact amaze me sometimes when the monsters were charging amazingly. Now, take care, you're tired of "computer game" movies. I do not remember a single success story in this new type of Hollywood, although some enjoy enough to be a spectacle. However, I was very impressed with the game and could not resist it. It was logical that if the film had a scheme much like the game, it would be good. <br /> <br /> A man, that was 90 minutes (which looked like 300) of my life and I will never go back to her. If I had the opportunity, I would gladly have arranged to rearrange my stocking drawer instead. This is not even in the class "Too bad it's funny." You might think that Christian Slater had a little more sense of joining this stinking bomb. Now, Tara Reed ... I do not complain about her existence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sexual scene, which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm young!) - I've seen a lot of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy to talk about. You will not waste your time styling for you. The credibility of the story sinks under "I did not have sex with Ms. Lewinsky." The representation is just a few of the top crevices "Street Fighter", which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I have seen, I recommend this OVER one. <br /> <br /> Kids, I recommend a video game. She has a much better story, acting and much more excitement. As for the film, there is a spoiler - it spreads! Wait for the pornographic version.
