When I first took this film, I was fascinated by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I am an animator and love it when it is successfully integrated with live footage. However, the animation in this film was about everything I enjoyed. Although it should be said that the performance of the actors was excellent. The visual appearance - including animation - gave an impressive atmosphere to the piece. However, this type of discomfort is lost between excess images, both visible and in text, which have been practically beaten. The most annoying about this was the lack of relative importance to the plot. It seems that the plot was fixed on the shoe at irregular intervals, giving a stuttering effect that greatly detracts from the flow of the piece. I felt the high voices of Felicerto - especially in the end - as a desperate attempt to fill the enormous gaps in the plot that were ignored in favor of side issues like the whole ants thing (and even this was not properly addressed). I am afraid that the entire piece appeared, at best, in a "reasonable first attempt", by a teenager who spent a long time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from experienced filmmakers at all.
