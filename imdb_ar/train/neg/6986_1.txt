I can not tell Al Pacino. I watch him in the godfather, Scarface, Carlito Wai, and I think I've been watching one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. Then I see him in the film "Two for money, one day given and the revolution," and I wonder what the man thinks. <br /> <br /> I stumbled on the "revolution" a few nights ago, and thought I would spend the next couple of hours on this. Flash: Do you want to make the prisoners talk? Forcing them to watch over and over again ... they will recognize anything. <br /> <br /> The plot will not be redrafted because there is no coherent plot, but it occurs during the American Revolution. Pacino plays an uneducated farmer who does not want to get involved, but he does not. While he has no money, no education, no clothes like a cave man, Natasha Kinski is so hot that he falls in love for no apparent reason, since the dialogue between them is only two minutes. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if "Al Smith" starred in this film, instead of "Al Pacino", he would have ruined their careers. The scenario was terrible, but the disappointing performance of Pacino and his obvious fraud made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was funny. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but she has 5 lines in the film. In fact, no one talks much in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the most laughable assumptions in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski possess this extraordinary skill of running constantly to each other on the battlefield. It's like the entire Northeast is Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to see you here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... I see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I am asked to give this one star by IMDb, because there is nothing here to get a negative score.
