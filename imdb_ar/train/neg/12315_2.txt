Well, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion I'm not Martin, he has never been and will never be a funny man as long as our background posters point to a southern trend. Phil Silvers was the role of Sergeant Bilko as a funny man, no doubt because of the talented writers, directors and all the other characters who worked in the talented team in the series and who contributed perfectly in one of the most entertaining comedy films and shamelessness ever produced by America. How anyone can have the audacity to even try to replicate Phil Silvers is something outside me. Complicating matters is that the exercise was repeated in Martin's failed attempt to be Peter's salesman Inspector Clouseau, another failed attempt, in my opinion, to revive a clearly foreign career. Some contributors say "Steve Martin puts his own character on", so I would say "Balderdash", and his picture will be forgotten long ago when Silvers and Sellars are estimated for future generations
