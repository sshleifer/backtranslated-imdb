I doubt that Jigsaw was so lively at that time, as the whole LSD was married to a murder mystery, a clear attempt to capture a young audience of the age without actually showing any understanding of counter-culture in the 1960s. Historically aside, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including over-representation, silly and flexible dialogue, memories of the LSD past that last long even after the home point was reached in the first 60 seconds, and failed to create any real suspense though The actual plot is, on paper, a great way to do it, and the end is very vulgar and predictable (not to mention a lot of bad TV programs) that the peak is actually a peak fight. If it's a better film, we may be able to suspend disbelief for some things that might help you enjoy it, but weaknesses are so blatant that they only highlight the possibilities that viewers might miss. I have seen a panorama on television and it is certain that the late-night television fare aims to fill the airspace and spend time killing someone's insomnia rather than anything that anyone should actively seek. At best, three out of 10.
