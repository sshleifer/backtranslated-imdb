It was a scary movie 2 very disappointed. Simply refer to movies, such as Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The film opens well enough with a funny and excellent white music scene of James Woods and Andy Richter. The film falls out of there unfortunately. The representation is appalling. Torre's spelling looks and works out quite the place. The film seems to be breaking and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags in this fast-paced film, including the joints and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise, were funny to anyone in my play. The film, fortunately, stopped screaming in the 83rd minute at the end of a shockingly unfamiliar. (I say shock, because the end does not even try to end with humor). I do not know what I'm saying except that it's a filthy hasty supplement that was made to make Miramax some cash on the appearance of stupid teenagers. Overall, very bad film done.
