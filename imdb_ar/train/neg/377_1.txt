Do not even ask me why I saw this! The only excuse I can get is that I had bronchitis and was weaker than changing the canal. :) It's very terrible for words, film, not bronchitis. Acting is sad, Richard Greco describes him as a happy gunman armed murderer with a tendency to overthrow the police. Nick Mancuso makes phone calls while playing the cop on his path and Nancy Allen has been able to put the only friendly role in the entire film. The text is depressed, full of clich√© lines, "Are you ready, Bardiner?" Richard Jericho violates each of his victims. terrible. Avoid.
