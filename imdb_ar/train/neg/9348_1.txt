I found this movie embarrassing to watch. I felt as if he were pushing the story down my throat as if I could not capture the minute details that I needed a voice to make clear to all of them constantly. <br /> <br /> Having a father is still addicted to alcohol, I really did not feel that it was a movie about alcoholism that way. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are the only people at home, in my opinion of course. They find it difficult to communicate, which is not really the main character, but he has a problem saying that I love you at some point - which was a weak effort to establish his cold personality. He was always surrounded by people too !? <br /> <br /> I felt deceived because we were not really alone with the sense of inner loneliness and turmoil. I could not contact the person and I had no connection at all to my father. I did not feel anything at all when it ended, I just felt relieved because it was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McEnd is a good actor, but he is not a strong guy's advantage! The orange orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too big for a teenager and had to have three different characters or avoid adolescence and focus more on McKidd's adult. <br /> <br /> In a good note, I felt that the little actor was really good. At the beginning of the film !!
