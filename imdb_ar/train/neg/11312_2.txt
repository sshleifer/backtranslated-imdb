The film deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic stories. Unfortunately, it drops at all levels. The biggest weakness of films is the unwillingness to commit to anything. It has a camp, moral, and epic elements without ever being committed to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes revolves in his grave in this terrible adaptation that turns Percival into an unbearable lover into a rude and rude proof. <br /> <br /> Most people will probably see this, francophiles or Arthuriophiles. When I spoke as one of the last film, I found that the film is unreachable and incredibly processed, and disrespectful to a beautiful story.
