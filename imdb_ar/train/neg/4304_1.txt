This anti-Serbian propaganda film was prepared for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, and Christian Orthodox Serbs are a thousand." <br /> <br /> This is the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to deliver a promotional message is not new. <br /> <br /> This movie is thickening. Many viewers and reviewers seem to be finishing it. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, under the command of General Draza MilhiloviÄ‡ and Shitnicks, rescued 500 American pilots dropped from the Germans in World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhallovic and put British support behind Tito's communist. Roosevelt followed suit, and as a result, after the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to Tito. <br /> <br /> The US media has been smeared since then. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and the International Crisis Group (ICG) culminating in the "Kosovo War" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO for completely false allegations by ICG Of the "mass graves" in Kosovo are full of "Serb victims." The fact that there are no such mass graves and that Albanians have no work in Kosovo in Serbia are facts that most media will not print. > I chose this movie to watch it because the description of one sentence on the cover of the video was fun. <br /> <br /> Imagine being disgusted when I found out that I had been deceived into a quarrel Another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda, someone must make a film about the unwillingness of the Clinton administration to appear with Congress and the American people about their collusion in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Islamic government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath waiting for such a film.
