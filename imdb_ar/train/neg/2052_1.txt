The waste of time this is a completely unnecessary remake of a wonderful movie. Nothing new or original is added besides Perry's reverse reaction, which is of marginal importance. It lacks the documentary sensation of the first film and the raw urgency that made it very effective. It is also painfully missing Acoustic soundtrack Quincy Jones that added a lot to the original film. I can not understand any high ratings for this at all. it's so bad. Why waste time or money making such waste and why do I waste time watching it?
