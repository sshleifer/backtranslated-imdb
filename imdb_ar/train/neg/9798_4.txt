15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially young people. When I was a three-year-old child living in the Philippines, I was watching this show every Friday on the ABS-CBN channel (Channel Two). When the film appeared in 1995, everything was shocking and horrifying to me when I saw it with my parents and two uncles. My ancestors sent me a "Balikbayan" box filled with Power Rangers (including the easy-to-build Megazord character and stuffed Rangers toys). I even played video games, and I loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. Anyway, this show was the cornerstone of my interest in the robot series (especially the anime mechanics series like "Gundam") Now that I am 18, I would like to think that this show is very cheesy now. To prove this, I made a trip to the memory lane by buying a dual-set DVD set with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watched both. I was like, "Love ... how awful ... just another scrap in the attic for me." For all of you my generation, this is not an offer you want to see again and again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing right now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers," I recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (highly recommended), Ninja Senshi Tobikage (also known as Ninja Robots), or even the Sent Sentai presentations that were the basis of Power Rangers.
