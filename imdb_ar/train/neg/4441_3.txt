"Triumph of Love" is proof that not every author of Comédie-Française, who uses cross-disguised engagement as Shakespeare deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps something has been lost in translating this amendment to Marifu, a playwright inspired by Comedia del Arte, Brittanyka says: "His precise feeling and the play of intelligent words became known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> Although Mira Sorfino enjoys hanging up on three mixed romances, the role of her trousers was not even for Chirubino in "Figaro's Marriage." An annoying thing seems to indicate that a lot of steps are needed for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Fiona Shaw was the sneaky puns, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The public profiles we see and the final call for ambiguity are that this is not really helpful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/29/2002)
