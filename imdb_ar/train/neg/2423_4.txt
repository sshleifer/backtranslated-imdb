I got this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about it. He had 7.8 in the IMDb (only 9 votes) and had some interesting external comments. But i have to say that giallo is very usual and uninterested. Yes, a great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never scared me. She starts well, but although she is not bored at all, the story is very ordinary and things happen naturally so much that I do not like her very much. <br /> <br /> You can laugh a little. And you can see some small breasts. But if you like the type of giallos that I like (strange, surreal, nonsense, surreal, air, and brutal murders ...) you will not appreciate this movie much. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 4 good directing and editing, and the final twists, which make the movie amusing. But it can be much better.
