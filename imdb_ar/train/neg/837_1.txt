I saw and liked the first two too much, really. Especially since the second is not just trying to make another one as good as the first one. It's a story standing alone. You do not have to learn the first movie. I liked it in "Free Willy" movies too. <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we loved the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is fine, there are funny parts okay. But what to? Timon and Bomba were funny creatures in the first two films. What Lion King 1 1/2 for me is: a serious attempt to get more fun for the first film than it already has, in addition to telling the story from their point of view. But what to? I really like to know. As you know, the idea that the two of them sitting in the cinema watching first, is a really nice idea. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I think a lot of people liked Timon and Bomba, as well as I really did. However, for me many parts are very built with an attempt to be funny. No chance, most of them were not funny at all, at least for me. going back to work. What is the film about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Bumba or b) trying to get more fun from the first film? I tend to choose option B and I am very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like "The Story Behind xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stubard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. This is really funny and do not try to get more Hamlet.
