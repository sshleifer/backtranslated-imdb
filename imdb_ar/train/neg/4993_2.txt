I went to watch this movie expecting a flick of "nothing too much" work, however I was very disappointed. The opening scene promised a little work with a touch of comedy. It keeps you clinging to half the coz for the first half until then you expect the time has come to start moving. Well, nothing like that happens. Pull the movie and end the end only to the point that bothers you. What the director was thinking. It makes no sense at all. The film lacks all aspects, it does not have a real story and it seems very hollow, even if Rambo is there, I do not think it could have helped in the assessment at all. There is simply no logic to the film. Perfect way to waste time and money. By far the most outrageous film I have ever seen, I am sure that there will be other people who will get the same view after you bear it. Certainly not for people who have little sense of film left in them.
