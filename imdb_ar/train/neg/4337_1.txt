This is just a wonderful story slaughtered by Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the story in the book. There are a lot of contradictions in the original film, so you have to wonder if the screenwriter has seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) from the prison came out of the original version. Here, Carlito retires with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to a generation of Lauren, Ohio? In this installment, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires with and assumes that she will marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think it was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this film. Pachanga was back in Pacino days. Now, is Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been some time since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb come from? Also, I think this film really shines for the ethnic tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing about. The mob does not get the treatment they did in the book. As has been erased in this film. However, Pleasant Avenue is in a magical way for the second film. <br /> <br /> The book tells a wonderful story. This film can tell a wonderful story. This is just a big disappointment. read the book. It's a better use of your time.
