From time to time, someone looks at me from the blue on my side and asks me "What about SNITCH'D"? I immediately know that they have a case of infiltration + hidden horror. As you can see, I was a cinematographer in the film. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points with regard to the "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, it was called SNITCH'D ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, one day after the conclusion of Triangle Square, a remarkable feature of 35mm that is not distributed like many independent features of the era, despite festivities ... SAG's hold the famous experimental feature. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Although I was about to leave, and when James asked me to shoot the 16mm little gangster with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000, and I did not want to break the speed, it took that. After all, writers, Martians ... I also believed in myth at the time. <br /> <br /> Let's just talk about it as a "film school" for many involved, including me. SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught drama at a high school in the last city (yes, he is a teacher of drama and English ... think about it while watching the movie, or even observe the use of a mono in the title), and then the sites and actors. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that the only dramatic appearance known to a weather girl in Channel Two Morning News in Vera Jim√©nez, the biggest impact is the appearance of Eva Longoria, who just got to Hollywood and was anxious as I get a movie under her belt. I must say that her professional dedication, focus and attitude "Let us do this" kept me inspiring and was an introduction to stardom that has yet to be realized. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D has suffered from poor optics, little lights or electricity, many operators are booming du jour, and offline delivery without debugging for copying. None of this dominates the actual content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> However, by 2003, the film had been sold to distributors (with a net loss, as I understood) who did not have an image of Eva in an incomprehensible way. box (by that time it was an up and down name), but it managed to get a clear picture of what appeared to be an authentic Latino bandit to lend credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's passion for dealing with old books seems to confirm that you can actually judge a book through its cover ... as many of them have picked up this DVD based on its cover. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on soap, I met James for one day to shoot a short short film he made, SPLIT SECOND, which I think he did not see any play though Of the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> After 6 years, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie called JUAREZ, Mexico. Although I put the process on hold, my participation depended on acting, writing and controlling the crew, and the resulting film seemed promising in the daily papers because it was ... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; Elsewhere, the film never appeared at any festival or venue, although Cahill repeatedly demanded the film's distribution and was awaiting its release to coincide with a DVD release of two studio photos on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and a border town.
