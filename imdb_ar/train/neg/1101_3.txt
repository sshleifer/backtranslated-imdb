This false journey never comes close to matching intelligence and insanity to the excellent adventure that these guys did in their first film. This batch tries to deviate from its pre-emptiness to capture some new blood from jokes, but it takes a wrong turn and does not go anywhere interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> There is almost half an hour wasted on showing men who perform rock concerts (and a lot of people watching on "free TV" - since when does that happen?) Surely the screenwriter could have done something more creative ; See how all the random elements in the first movie were neatly linked together by meeting the scientific presentation. Not in this film, which really ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke is over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper was neglected in the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole schema, is poorly done and lacks the sparkle of a comedy or audience share. There is an impression ZZ Top, reached without reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But there is nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
