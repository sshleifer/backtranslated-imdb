This movie is really wonderful. After seeing it advertised, I thought it could have a charm ... but it did not. The girls can not act, nor can they sing. The soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs, not a beautiful scene, a terrible storyline, an incredible plot, one of Disney's worst Disney movies. The ally is not a bad actress on the "future elephant", so I do not know what happened in the "bells of the cow." It seems that her sister, a. C. , She only toured the "fame" of her sisters, and showed no talent at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn some of the clich√©s of morality, but this is the late saving of this movie wreck train. <br /> <br /> Awful
