I do not know what Oscar voters saw in this film, but they have to see some difficult things to see in them so they can give them the best Oscar pictures. All I know is that fortunately there was a Kelly gene playing in it or it would be as bad as I think. First of all, I do not think Leslie Karon was really qualified to do this role. She is not that talent, she is not a great dancer and does not look good at all. It is shameful for a representative or actress to damage a film, just like it was because if Leslie Karon did not do it, he would make a great film. The story was clever, the output was not bad, and as I said, Jane Kelly was good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Karon just to criticize her, I just say it because I think this is the worst part of the film. She is probably a good actress, but I can not tell her because I have not seen her in anything else, but I think she was very bad in "American in Paris". So if you want to see it, keep going, but I tell you, you're better off watching "Singin" in the rain. "
