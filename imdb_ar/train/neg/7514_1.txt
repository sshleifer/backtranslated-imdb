A low budget effort from Texas was filmed at least well, but this is a bit of solace. Bad behavior, or, I should say, over-representation is bad, line a fairly lame story, this is not something, special effects bad, bad, bad, bad. A handful of young people seem to be assembling a haunted Halloween house, which is done every year, but things are different this year. It has a long extended lesbian feature that is not only annoying, but fills up empty sites, which have a lot to it. Corrupt, childish, certainly avoidable, at any cost.
