The highlight of this film was for me without a doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely against writing and showed that he could handle a non-traditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the right man in the film - the person you admire, admire and reach. Sullivan certainly was not a good man. It is true that in the context of this film he was perceived as somewhat noble - his aim was to avenge the murders of his wife and younger son. However, he was already a gangster and fought before these killings. So Hanks played a role I did not expect, and he did well. <br /> <br /> If the good Hanks are doing well, I certainly could not describe this movie as a fun movie. After the opening, which I prefer to describe as vague (it was not clear to me for a while where this was), it turns into a very bleak movie about the complex relationships that Sullivan developed as gangs - largely raised by Ronnie (Paul Newman) The head of the mob, trying to raise his children and keep them "clean", so to speak; isolated from his work. After the elder son sees a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, and gets the wrong son (and mother), leaving Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) running away. Becomes a strange thing from the bonding film between the father / son. <br /> <br /> Although it ends somewhat hopefully (at least in the general context of the story), but it is very dark everywhere, this mood is reinforced with many scenes being shot in the dark And heavy rainfall. I have to admit that while I appreciate the performance of Hanks, the film as a whole did not appeal to me
