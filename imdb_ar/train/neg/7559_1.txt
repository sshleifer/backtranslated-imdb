This must be one of the worst fillings I've ever seen and I've seen few of them. It is slow, tedious and amateurish - and is not even consistent in its simplified reading of the plot. Actors do not act. I can not blame them - they have been given a scenario of absolute stupidity, and all they can do is pass it with pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with SummersIsle. <br /> </> There is not a single moment in this film that rings true - neither a straight line nor a single moment is moved. Nicolas Cage's character is so badly portrayed that one does not feel a passion for him through all his ordeal. I have no doubt that I was watching a man suffering there but Nicholas Cage was fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst film in his entire career.
