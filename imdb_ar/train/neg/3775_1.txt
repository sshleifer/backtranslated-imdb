As other viewers have noted, this film was an enjoyable experience in photography. Colors are bold comic book. I think the director has had a "technical vision" about the appearance of the film instead, and he needs a lot of attention to the content. Although cast astral, the performances are dim and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was likely to be just a trick to get pre-press release. It's good that her appearance here has given some credibility to her album "I'm Breathing" (a music inspired by Dick Tracy), which was a great success in the stratosphere (largely due to the inclusion of the song "Vogue" For this film). I think the bulk of the money from this movie came from the bindings to Madonna's "Anna Breeth" album. <br /> <br /> If you see him at home, by the end, I think "there are two hours of my life I would like to return." Save yourself time lost - do not care about this.
