I saw this movie originally in the theater, when I was 10. Or jeff Goldblum I was annoyed and I started to feel very uncomfortable and slightly saddened. Until I was reminded of this film today, I was not sure why I felt this way. It seems I've closed my memory for this film, but my negative feelings towards two of the culprits have remained. I obviously forgot that I saw this film but I am saddened by my spiritual consciousness that was stolen, and not eaten by the creators in this inhumane act. <br /> <br /> As an adult. I envision it as part of the healing process that I should probably address in the face of this childhood fear so that I can really put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea either.
