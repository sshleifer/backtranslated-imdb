I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as "the worst film I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore dodgy accents, low production values ​​and horrible camera work, this movie does not go at all for it. I just went to see him because I read the book and wanted to see how they would work on the complex plot in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they did not. The characters appear without much explanation of who they are, and then move on to play any precious role in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason, so when the film reaches its peak, do not care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books sometimes need to be rewritten to fit movies and that it may be unfair to judge this film against the book that was adopted from it. But after my friends left and went out of the cinema, I had to spend most of the journey at home to clarify what was supposed to have happened. <br /> <br /> They have even changed the real meaning of the title of the book "Rancid Aluminum" by pressing it in another piece of sound is useless only so they can allow the film to have a great title. <br /> <br /> A real mess for a movie from start to finish.
