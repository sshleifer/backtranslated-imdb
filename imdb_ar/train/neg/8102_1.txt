Oh, I heard a lot about this film. I went to see it with my best friend (she's female, I'm male). Now, let me have a divergent view of the mainstream. After the first couple of dozens of "take off your clothes", we felt both a very strange mix of tampering and boredom. We laughed (at that, not with her), we were angry (and it was better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we spent money in vain. We had. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people who were impossible to care for. Waste of money, a waste of cellulite. This film does not deserve one vote out of every ten votes, but it has the lowest available votes. I'm not sure why this movie has an excellent reputation. I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a little taste or intelligence.
