This film is one of history's most distorted images. This film, grossly inaccurate, does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous workers who were killed by the sadists and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man," the Japanese chief engineer said. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese hijackers are the source of a film, where the bridge itself, does not come close to the exact bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What about the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the film and everything it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured and killed by sadists. Those who have not died due to crowding, hunger, or illness are deeply hurt by the film that makes light these dark times.
