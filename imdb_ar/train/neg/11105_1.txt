It was not logical and it was so bad ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like this ... you do not have to watch them. People cutter or eater what should I say ... I've made me sick! My God! The film revolves around people we do not know but feed themselves with human beings! They have bla bla teeth ... is not this familiar? I can bet you saw him in another movie. The cast was very big but I think the script was really awful. I would say that Bradley Cooper was very wonderful ... he is very talented ... in fact I said awful but I think because of the horrible scenes ... let me explain it. Have you eaten the tongue before but in the movie one person did it! It was really bad ... anyway, I think the film would be good without scenes of terrible food or horrible scenes ...
