I enjoyed the former Ittenbach film I saw, "Burning Moon". But while this film was rather bleak and bad, it seems that "Premutos" often plays for laughs. While it is impressive how Eitenbach made this film without money in his free time (the documentary DVD is worth the effort to see), I found myself always fighting to avoid the next scene. Sure, there is Gore, if that is all you want then go ahead and enjoy it. But be careful: there is a huge amount of lame comedy and a boring story show. Many compare it to Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead." But given what Jackson did with a similar budget in "Bad Taste," Ittenbach clearly lacks one thing Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for the effects of a good and abundant gor, to get the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money you paid for it)
