I hate to be the person who rained down on a procession (even a little like this), but from the first scene, you can say that this movie will be nonsense at all. It's really shameful, as I love Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was fascinated by how they mixed in the movie together, but what bothered me was that they did not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat this - the main actors (who stand side by side on posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together! They did not talk to each other and did not appear on the screen at the same time. Just summarizes this bad excuse for a movie. False declaration. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, each character in the film was unrealistic and inhumane. The scenarios were elusive, the plot was folly, the jokes were thin, and Freeman tried to be funny (he played Tim's housekeeper from the office), no one was loved, and worse, some characters were like that. It was annoying that he pushed me to close, so I could no longer see him, or listen to them for longer. <br /> <br /> These low stuttering in the budget would fail the epic. So Danny Dyer could not pump some humor and magic into it, but bless him. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How can anyone classify this movie as "Ten Stars" is far from me. Ten stars? seriously? Come on .... I will not even give some of the top ten stars, where ten stars indicate that the film was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which meant it was almost completely bleak. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you like, but if you watch a lot of movies and watched a lot of movies great movies, your review is likely to resemble your film. <br /> <br /> 1/10
