The sequel has a bad habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can make is that it preserves this old tradition. These three tales are not as good as anything from the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far, the best trilogy includes a wooden idol coming to life to avenge the thugs who killed their owners. The second story revolves around the monster of the lake that looks like nothing but a lot of floating downhill, making you wonder how anyone can be afraid of it. The third story includes a hijab from Steven King as a truck driver, but otherwise it is an unforgettable story about a victim of a traffic accident from the dead for the person who dropped him. <br /> See the original Creepshow instead, or if you have already done so be happy with it.
