Is this the movie ?? Is this what Indians are trying to show? I think this is one of the extra efforts made by the sick-minded director to reject the Pakistani soldiers and in fact a country .... But what we Pakistanis know that we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... not only in the armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie was filmed badly like Border in early 1997 ... The director and writer just tried to overcome the shame of defeat at Cargill by Pakistani armed forces, by creating such films .. <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... We will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tried to make some good movies instead of films like that nonsense
