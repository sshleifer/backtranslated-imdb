I am surprised by the positive reviews of this totally inspiring film. <br /> <br /> Foreign films often skip reviews that complain of the slow pace of "absence of action," as many of the best international films do not interest you. Look out for Hollywood's western model of storytelling. <br /> <br /> I enjoy frequent intelligence and the lack of cliches in the foreign movie theater. I enjoy that many foreign films do not tie things in a neat little arc. <br /> <br /> However, this particular film did not offer a compensatory value for the time it was wasted viewing it. No meaningful personal development, no attractive story story, no way to share emotional with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A handful of emotionally enthusiastic listeners who control the colonies mistreat their slaves, and a little girl is hurt by her only friend when the "house boy" finally feeds and hurts her. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraph is moving and exciting, this movie will move you while the script is running. I was so busy that it took three sessions to finish it, and I would not have done it had it not been for positive ratings. <br /> <br /> Unless you have academic interest in this period, I strongly suggest moving away from this stage.
