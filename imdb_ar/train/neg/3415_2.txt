In the standard show, this is a totally awful film. However, it classifies the degree of near perfection on the scale of unintentional comedy. I can think of a few actual comedy films that make me laugh hard as I was watching this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffiths, an apostate, sends me original American dance clothes to the hysterics every time. I will not waste gas or energy driving the car to the video store to rent it, but if you put it on the couch at 3am and come on TV, check it out.
