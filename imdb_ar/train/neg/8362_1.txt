This is a really bad film. I have suspended my mind and can not make one positive comment. Representation is terrible. I have seen more valid offers when cables are reached. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the secret recordings of the president, and the shark attacking anything approaching him were supposed to make him fun at worst. Shark night is not too bad. The dialog appears and is delivered as if it was written seconds before filming. Most importantly, Night of the Sharks has the worst vocal music I have ever heard of. I am surprised that my ears did not begin to bleed from the artistic sounds collected in the 1980s that someone really bothered to score. <br /> <br /> From everything I read, the Italian film industry died by 1987. Night of sharks resemble the last nail in the coffin.
