Dear, dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, this nail was in the coffin with respect to its Hollywood career. After a strong shift in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar, and Rock Hunter, Jayne seemed to be about to become one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, the obsession with the publicity and his appearance in this filmmaker has made Mansfield on the sidelines, cheap euro loans until Fox drops her contract as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a demonic time-wasting everyone except Susie Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame Jane for her sharp performance in achieving the weak returns of this film at the box office, and despite being a pain in this film, she can only do her best with this article. After all, barely puts a fire on the screen Is it? After a bunch of very good comedy and drama, Jane turns 10 steps back in chasing her as a serious actress by agreeing (just to appear with Grant) to portray this stupid stupid danger. Her character from Alice is a full cartoon bimbo, and although she looks good enough to eat in a kettle suit, her appearance in the film bothers you. We all know that Jane can do better than this slag, yet she wanders around like a pudding trophy. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this alleged comedy. It's more blues than funny.
