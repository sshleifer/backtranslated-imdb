Although this subject is an amateur and leading film - or effort in one show - it is as interesting and bold as the composition book of a high school student my mood is full of "poetry" death. Undoubtedly, it will annoy viewers who seem determined to be upset, but success will be attributed to themselves, not to the director. Getting someone's skin really requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent as well as eye and ear. The film contains one vivid image, shown as fixed (also used in the video tray), but without any development leading to or away from it. If the director had been appointed, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting film - a movie.
