I recently watched this movie with my sister who likes Sofia Loren's shows. I am a person they call cultural barbarism. I hate art in any kind of shape or shape. Rambo is more kind of movies, motion, murder, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like Plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, no such thing. Let me give you a CV in a few sentences. Starts with 5 minutes in Nazi propaganda in black and white. Every Italian in an apartment building brings a homage to Hitler, with the exception of a housewife, Fassi and a caregiver. A housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets with fascism. She falls in love with him and wants to make him love her, but anti-fascist gay. Despite this, they make love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the same man is deported by the clients. End. Want a shorter resume? Boring ... this short enough? The man had to use his gun at the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the public from these atrocities. On my side my sister loved this film. As I said, I am cultural barbarism ...
