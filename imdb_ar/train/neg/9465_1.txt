From acting, direction, scriptwriting, and artistic direction this film is just a bad perception, and it was better to spend money on the shoes of landmine victims. When we are so sad that they have to fill aa film for children with a sexual tip to keep parents' attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. Swiss is circulating in his grave now, what about "shit", fake erection scenes, etc. It is outrageous how they trade in the name of Suess to make parents bring their children and give abusive words to teenagers and some parents The sad ones who will not watch a movie with their child if there is no greed T & A. Greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this with classic children's movies, and we can get a disturbing view of the world. How did this film get 400 votes as the top 10 votes outside of my work (unless the family members of the board)
