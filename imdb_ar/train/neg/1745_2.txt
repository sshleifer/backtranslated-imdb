The first half hour of the film was going steadily and the characters were shown. However everything was suddenly happening very quickly, a lame reason for Akshi Kumar so far 3 girls, very loud on acting by both Akshi and John Abraham. Neha Doubia was the highlight of the film, and Parish Rawal had performed well but not as well as in Hera Ferry. Overall this film was the biggest disappointment film does not do justice to the trailer. Save your money and do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> Summarized: A cheap theatrical play and the appearance of the film is not a story or an article, the plot was unusual in the sense of good music from Preetam the guy who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! The film was filmed all in one room, the new arrivals (female actors) was fine because it was their first film but the well-known actors such as Akshi and John were completely disappointed by a founding director like Preadarshan giving his worst film ever!
