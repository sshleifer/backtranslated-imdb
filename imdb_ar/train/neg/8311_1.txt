What this film failed to answer is how wrong this war is (and most American wars that have just happened to get some oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian victims, how many lives have been lost and how many people are killed are blatantly stupid. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if the American soldier kills women and children apart from the enemy, it is fine, but if the government kills their troops by mistake with deadly chemicals while many civilians are killed, okay As well? Your logic fails, Dear Gentleman. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 5 for strong performance and one for everything else, 3 in total.
