All I was thinking of while watching this movie was a slap B grade. Many have spoken of the quality of its replacement: how this film depicts a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and their individuality and subsequent causality in the self-sustaining state of unfortunate events. However, in fact, the technologies used (as many have already said) were too useable, and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it was faint, inconceivable and unbelievable. And twisted. You can read most other reports about this movie and they will say the same thing as I would like. <br /> <br /> Some actors and actresses were attractive but when faced with such boring work ... they seem to just carry a movie so far. The work is poor and sporadic: a few punches thrown here and there, and finally a final shooting. Nothing really writes about him at home. <br /> <br /> As others have said, "BAD" films are great for watching because they are "bad", you are in that fact. This film, however, is a vacuum. nothing. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if one really needs an instructional film to scare people away from drug abuse, I would seriously recommend any number of other films that deal with such issues in much more effectively. Some examples are "Requiem For A Dream", "Trainspotting", "Fear And Hate In Las Vegas" and "Candy". Although one must also check out some of the most creative films about the same theme like "Go" (in general, dangerous and funny) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> In a final note, you can retrieve the line in the stolen film by Vinnie Jones from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels. The belief that a large part of this wonderful film has been contaminated with a "loader" is despicable. <br /> <br /> In general, I strongly suggest that you save money and your time by not seeing this movie.
