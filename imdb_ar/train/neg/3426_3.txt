Be a fan of manga and anime for Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, ETC), I was looking forward to this. I did not see the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceived ideas. Something good also. What we have here is a series of silly kind films that used to appear on a regular and alarming basis on cable channels late at night. While being tamed compared to what is bumped into ordinary viewers of cables (either our naughty heroines are tastily tucked behind a strategic poster or decorated with a bright effect on the sun), there are protracted scenes of slavery and torture that lend procedures just enough confusion to make them Suitable for children. While I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur movies (there are at least four in the series). On the plus side, there is at least an amazing beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw. No wonder that the TESTICLE BOY of Nagai did not make it ...
