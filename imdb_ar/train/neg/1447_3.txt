It was 1934 when Shirley Temple played three major films and really started making a name for itself. Unfortunately, the studios had an experience to see what the public liked best here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. It was another interesting short film, which kept people's attention and raised their minds about the recession. You know other keys to successful Shirley movies. <br /> <br /> This film did not achieve any of the above, despite the presence of Gary Cooper and Carol Lombard despite a very good director Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are many parts spoken here that have become simply boring, and a lot of arguments between Lombard and arrogant Cooper. To overcome this, she did not get the usual end of feeling satisfied, which is what the public wants. I think they learned after this film.
