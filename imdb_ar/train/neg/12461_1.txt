Unlike most other comments on "Syriana" on IMDb's web site, I and my family found that watching this movie on DVD at home was a complete waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a film based on a script that was a very smart writer. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in a smart and clear way, it was supposed to be a mostly vague and difficult look to communicate with some 30-second short stories from different story lines of dozens of "storylines" or so on to make the audience great And clear. No sir, no. What distinguishes great observation is clarity, accuracy, plots, story lines - and descriptions - which have a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie show - closer to a dim sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is extremely tonic and nonsensical. <br /> <br /> Thanks to God, then, for the TV shows and DVDs presented by Hollywood and the Newer British Cinema in their forties and fifties, the director and actors knew the value of storytelling, textures, and acting, which meant something . <br /> <br /> This is one DVD that will not be able to sit again.
