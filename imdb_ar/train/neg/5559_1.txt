This is the worst film I have ever seen. The Avengers held this suspicious honor? But no longer. Representation in the "Generation of the Ripper" is terrible and was broken only by the plot. This film is intellectually stimulating like Telletubbes. Does not know whether he wants to have a flick about S & M or really bad stir. See only under extreme poisoning or if you are a mattress and need to wear leather clothes. This text must be rephrased in a pornographic form, it will not take much effort and will have a longer default life. Pornography, even bad porn, will not cause damage to the career of Dolph Lundgren in the way that the film appeared.
