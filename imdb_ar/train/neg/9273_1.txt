The first question that comes to mind after seeing this garbage is what gave these idiots on earth the right to use the name of the omen in this film? It is a shameless, embarrassing and pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the background music seems to have been lifted directly from Bugs Bunny Cartoon and then on, the film becomes worse! I do not know who wrote the script but I bet they got an email - because they brought it back to show their teacher! It is hard after a while to find out if this is a comedy because what is happening is very funny and incorrect for the original Omen omen that conjures up. The acting is laughable, especially from the leading lady Phi Grant. Continue to pull the silly faces or do you find it difficult not to laugh? Hard to say. The worst chain I have ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.
