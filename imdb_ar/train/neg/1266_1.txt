If there is hell, it contains a viewing room in which CANYON GRAND plays again and again on an eternal ring. One might hope that the presence of many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alvary Woodard, Kevin Klein, Mary Louise Barker - will help offset the presence of Mary McDonnell (who stops going to watch her own films forever). but not. They seem to have injected those other actors with a vaccine made of McDonnell. The whole thing is a claim, an exaggeration, or an insult (if you are deaf or know someone who is, get ready for your blood to boil in the funny TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of repugnant and self-employed people, but it never gives us reason to admire / understand / sympathize or even tolerate them. Except in rare cases, they are unbearable losers that the gene set would be better without them. There is no conspiracy to talk about, no evolution of characters (these people will never develop), no spectacular performance, and the greatest amount of writing you will encounter in a movie. The best thing about the Grand Canyon? Title. This is one big hole of the film.
