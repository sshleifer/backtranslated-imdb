A real disappointment from Mr. Big Visual Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of the first woman ever to train on hell in naval seals. Training is the most difficult and difficult to exist, says the coach in the film of the character O'Neal played by Demi Moore. There is no message or point in this movie or after that I could not access it correctly. It may be a kind of statement of women's rights and abilities, but all this drowns under tired scenes and fighting in the stupid Venice at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why Ridley used a lot of buzz in the last gun battle mentioned in the desert ?! It seems sooooo stupid and annoying and almost amateurish so I really like to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at his last film, Black Hawk Dawn, there's nothing wrong with the scenes of the battles (which are many) and they are very dense and skillfully oriented. The end is all in G.I. Jane looks ugly and nothing more than shooting and killing stupid and without brains. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film for Ridley Scott in my opinion and there are no significant touches known by this great director. I'm still happy because I saw it in Widescreen format because there are still great scenes and samples of Scott's capabilities, but they are very few in this film. <br /> <br /> Disappointment and nothing compared to Classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) for this talented director. So I am forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
