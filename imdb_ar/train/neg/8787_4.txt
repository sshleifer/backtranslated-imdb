I first heard about the white noise when I saw the TV commercial. Before that I did not know it existed. I watched the online trailer and decided to go and see it. Now that I'm a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought this film would give me everything I wanted. Michael Keaton has it, and he rocks it. Unfortunately, the film was not delivered. I tried to be a sixth sense or another sensation, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the medium extends to repeating itself, and ends with a completely poor development that any monkey can discover. Unfortunately, like most "scary" movies nowadays, they rely on high sounds and explosions to make the audience jump. This movie could have been much more. It's a shame because it's a good idea.
