The 1989 film "The Dream Child" is the fifth film in the series "Nightmare," and in the end, the series is the total trash. The only good films in the series are the original Wes Craven film in 1984, and the third part, "The Dream Warriors" of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and the fourth part was where the former madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with the continuing stupid jokes. This fifth entry of the series hardly recommends anything except the visual (great) images, and one creepy scene, a retrograde sequence of how Freddy Krueger appeared. The rest of the film consists mainly of a mono-mongering scream that turns into a clown, shouting a monotonous idiot, and the old version of a handful of teenage girls who try hard to avoid sleep, because old Freddie is waiting for them to sleep. Dreams. Lisa Wilcox returned to the role of Alice Johnson, and added a bunch of interesting crap, such as the "stupid" children's rhyme, without any reason other than getting some kind of justification for making this sequel redundant and boring. .. In short: no originality, just a drop in the old version, over-loaded painful nagging jokes. My (3/10) classifications go back to the great visuals, especially the emphasis on the difference to the terrible next part "Freddy's Dead", which is very terrible. If you are not enthusiastic about Freddie Krueger, you should avoid The Dream Child, and even if you are, you are likely to disappoint.
