Well, this is my first post attached to IMDb. , I got it, this film has made me come and warned all good souls that will stop trying movies. <br /> <br /> Since most of them have given their comments I thought about watching this film because it seemed to have some decent actors (although I read the worst critics against this film) I thought of his experience on the assumption that he represented some comedy. . , Comedy .... Then everything began to pity ... The man who can believe yourself, you will feel like going and hitting your head every time you make a pathetic woman called the heroine of the film helpless. ..Huh ~~ Well, how far can a person digest a patient every potential witch ghost tries to do everything he can to irritate you and prevent you from doing what you do. <br /> <br /> The movie is a "ZOMBIE" hero, yes because he loses his fiance as he walks around like a goat, with black marks rattling his eyes. And with the sister of the hero "stupid terrible" .. You will drain from the head to the soles of the feet if you tried and succeeded in watching this film completely ~!
