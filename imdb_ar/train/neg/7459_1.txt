Please save your money and go to see something else. This film was a piece of this crap. I did not want to go, but I had to so I thought I was laughing at least once, no. Not a single laugh, it was terrible! Chris Kattan will not get a good comedy role after this and "A Night in Roxbury". This film is quite clear, has no humor at all, and repeats itself over and over again. Listen to me and stay away from this movie as much as possible!
