I do not often go to my way to write comments, but for this, I had to warn only anyone who might think that by watching it they would see comedy. This does not come close. While the hypothesis (change in color / sex / anything) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before), the actual transformation of two black people into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations on display. It would be bad enough if all that was required in the script was a change in the white chicks. The Wayans, however, are asked to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you have guessed now, they fail completely. I've seen drag queens without makeup make women more convincing than these two with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide. Its appalling. Add to the mix a basketball player built like the building and the terrible dialogue and holes plot more than the golf course and this movie reaches a new personal level. I love bad movies! Avoid like plague.
