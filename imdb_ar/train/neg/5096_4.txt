Kurt Russell (Steven Post's role) as a postman for the struggling UBC television station (the United Broadcasting Corporation) does not go anywhere at work and offers silly projects like Dr. Abraham Lincoln's Doctor for Studio Directors - because Lincoln and the doctors and dogs are popular . Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X Wellbanks) dismisses Mr Russell's proposals wisely, but has no idea how to choose a successful TV show. His secretary Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who has a double duty with his girlfriend at Russell, has a chimpanzee coming out of Russell when he wants to watch television. It turns out that the monkey watches all popular shows, and can easily choose visits. Russell discovers chimpanzee talent and uses it to enhance his career. Understandably, things get poetry for messengers and actors! <br /> <br /> Raffles the chimp (managed by Frank Lamping) performs well; they show clouds of boredom and / or distract their attention in a few scenes, when chimpanzees are supposed to be interested; this can be corrected with re-takes Or editing. There's a slight alphabetical edge - imagine a monkey choosing a successful TV show! And, it's a monkey who gets beer during commercials (drinks in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a group of talented TV actors to identify and try to identify the place. You can make a game to drink, in honor of curtailing beer at Raffles, by guessing the actors, and where you've seen them before. Here's the beginning - hey, is not this "Doctor Bellows" from "I Dream With Jenny"? Down Slot! <br /> <br /> **** The Baref Executive Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
