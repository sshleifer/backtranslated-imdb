It is useful to know why a long book such as the "The House Next Door" has been used to adapt it to film or television. Copyright of the book in 1978. One of the reasons may be problems in the design of "home". The house in the movie "Lifetime" is so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is very ugly because someone would probably come and destroy it once it is built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about the horror books of genre, but it was hard to put down this kind of book when I came. Through it about ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people who are looking for anything mysterious in life, that is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who conclude that the architect was a kind of devil .. (or the body of the devil) without watching and analyzing the events described well in the book. However, it is an optimistic book for the most part, and I do not think this appeals to people who run a lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the coming years. Best house .. Better music .. Better screenplay and darker lighting ... will definitely help.
