I was crazy about anyone who made this movie. I was more angry than the time I lost in the precious minutes of my life as I sat to watch it. I could have wax function and you are more entertaining. At least Chery makes me laugh before it hurts me. I was a bit confused at first but then I realized and realized what was going on. By this time the film was halfway, and yes I'm a procrastinator but I always want to see things to the end. So I stuck it out I saw everything. Not only that the actors are not as attractive as in harsh intentions, but they are not only convincing. I saw my nephew cry for a more convincing interest than the supposed lust that appears on the screen in this film. If you love bad movies with bad acting watch this.
