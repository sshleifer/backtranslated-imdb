As a poker fan, I was looking forward to seeing this film - especially with Scotty Newgen in it. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the short locations of Scotty Nyugens in this film are all that happens. <br /> <br /> The characters are unwanted and annoying, the soundtrack is awful and the plot, well, there is no one. <br /> <br /> Frankly I got a headache and found myself reading the bar code number on a DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. It's really shameful that Newgen was in this movie, otherwise I would not waste $ 16 in exchange for buying it from the Ebay website. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - avoid like 7 2 offsuit !!! terrible. :(
