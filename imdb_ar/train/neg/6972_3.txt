When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing some nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this flick, who always does a good job in any role played .... FX is very gracious, there is not much plot, I'm still not sure why this movie is named Blue Monkey, because it There is nothing in this film about the monkey. But come on people, what do you expect? It's not as bad as it sounds ... If you enjoy black and white-style bug-fixing movies in the 1950s, this version is basically an updated version, without FX updates
