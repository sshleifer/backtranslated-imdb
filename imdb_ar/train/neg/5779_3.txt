I watched this movie a few days ago ... What the hell? <br /> <br /> I liked movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are funny and fun. When I saw a name for that title and the kind that I thought was gorgeous, this could be really good ... some parody of police imitations or other awesome movies ... but ... then I read a preview and thought it could be good anyway ... but they were not ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: If the films are somewhat like documentaries, with a little comedy that has tried some Moore films or autopsies, they are about something. This one was empty. <br /> <br /> And put a comedy on the title ... no comment ... really bad joke
