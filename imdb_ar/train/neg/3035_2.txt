We were introduced to the movie - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll admit that ever since I was white and had no practical experience in the "world of progressive dance competition," I might not be exactly in control of this kind of film. On the other hand, I know a bad picture of the movement when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw her. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqbal Rasheed ("A Touch of Pink"), the story "How to Move" tells how important it is to follow one's dreams - even if those dreams include hip-hop music Loud and irritating. A conversation a normal person will not understand if he or she has an international interpreter. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a short summary of the "plot". First of all, there are two representatives who look like LL Cool J working at a Toronto auto shop (Mecca for racial diversity), but still have time to practice eight hours of dance a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other players in this "crew", including a symbolic white man and a man resembling Washington Denzel in "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the film - one like Serena Williams and the other like Geraldine from the old Flip Wilson Show. One of these women was expelled from a private college because her parents spent all her lessons teaching her addicted sister. No doubt the other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is not good. <br /> <br /> Another guy looks like Eddie Murphy buckwheat, while another is still playing around Huggy Bear. These guys are competing step dancers. Obviously, this activity is very difficult in the hood, and they all train on the big "Step Monster" traffic in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I have not been able to understand 90 percent of the dialogue (some translations may have been useful, as in Bergman or one of Snow's music videos), it's hard to explain what happens, The argument, Serena Williams (who never smiles, by the way) becomes an independent stalker (moving from one group to another), there are some dances and lots of annoying hip hop music. <br /> <br /> It's a typical breeder story; kind of like "Rocky" with really bad soundtrack, "Ruddy" with annoying rap in the background, "Freedom Cry" without a laugh. <br /> <br /> But why should the movie - which could have had a big impact on black audiences - contain drug addiction, bad parents, and an address that looks like a first grader says "How is it moving"? <br /> <br /> However, "I" moved from this movie. I moved to leave the theater as soon as possible.
