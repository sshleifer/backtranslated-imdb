This film had a lot of potential - a strong team, a reasonably strong idea and a clear budget. I'm not sure where all this went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. The story did not go anywhere, and the characters were hollow at the very least and the result was a very wasteful, meaningless, movie. I hated that. If we judge through other voices, I am a minority here and I must be a stranger. However, I think this movie was awful. I had great hopes, but I was very disappointed. A special disappointment was the character of Judy Foster. "Installer" is very conceited of what kind makes a nice idea. Judy was confident and exciting, but the character did nothing and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - fun but nothing new.
