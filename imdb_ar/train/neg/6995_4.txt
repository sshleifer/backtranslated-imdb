Funny how many people who say that this is much higher than the Romero version tend to be too young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a full-blown spot and a movement full of motion and "Whoopee" fills the MTV video for two hours. (The Massacre was a complete disaster) ... a very good, circular, predictable work In the "Who Will Die Later" classes and the total criticism in the name of "Dawn of the Dead", which will generate a lot of revenue alone by original fans who will go and see it out of curiosity ... Classics do not reshape your nerves? Can they really not go out with something original? Why New Dawn Dawn of the Dead? The things that made the original version (which children think the middle part is so boring, supposed to be slow to show how when you get all that you're still unhappy) are quite missing. This is a flick action, clear and simple. The faster the better. If you are in actual clicks (and so on, the 2004 version is good) but good for anyone who likes a small article in his movies ... Get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> See movie theaters Over the next few years, when we get the Godfather series that has been shown by anyone else who is a pop director right now, Star Wars will be back again, with all children telling how the new version is better than the old miles. The version is slow and tedious and carries a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the Romero version, not this file
