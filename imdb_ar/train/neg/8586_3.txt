What a disappointment ... It is recognized that the best in the vanguard, but the story is weak, the plot has been rushed and the end result is just a set of specific pieces, which were poorly achieved and dealt with in a playful manner. There are many errors of continuity that collide starkly with the original films. The appearance of Darth Vader has been so horrifying that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now just a cheesy fool that will be ridiculed for many years. I will not complain about this deep dialogue, because this is Star Wars ... The original three films are characterized by style, sense of worship and stories of cracking, and the strange dialogue added magic. Prequel had been shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love appeared in the Bastogne. Totally disappointing.
