Not only is this film written and produced badly, it is simply repugnant. The twist of the novel is terribly beautiful in this film. Many changes have been made to the story story, and the timeline is supposed to be simplified. But what results are simply confusing. Representation can not overcome the text that removes the motives of the characters for their behavior. In addition, conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the Patriarch Esteban as ESteban. terrible. Please read the wonderful version in Spanish if possible. Do not see this movie. It will ruin for you what could be a great experience.
