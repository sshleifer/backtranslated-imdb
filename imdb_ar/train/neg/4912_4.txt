After I have not read the novel, I can not tell how true this film is. The story is a typical ambiguous article: The Killer targets newlyweds. A woman falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Yes, it looks like a soap opera and that is exactly what it plays. The first 2/3 dull, except for the killings, occurs 1/3 of the partial return because it moves quickly toward its twisted end. <br /> <br /> Representation is strictly acting, although it is difficult to blame actors alone: ​​a terrible scenario. During the last 1/3 stop the observation because the film becomes really interesting, but this is only 1/3 of the last. Director Russel Mulkahi works in his element, but there is much he can do with the TV budget and web censorship on his back. It is largely limited to rapid cutting and distorted lenses, although it was able to squeeze in a few "underground" shots during the killings in the club's toilet. Unfortunately, since this is made for television, the superb structural details that it uses well with a wider image can not be found anywhere. Note for producers: Give this guy a reasonable budget and a distorted visual lens when renting it. <br /> <br /> Summarize: This movie is bad according to film standards and average by TV standards (see CSI, instead). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some excellent suggestions: Take a copy of Dario Argento's "Red Red" ("My Best"), "Opera" or even "Tenebre". It is stronger in every category.
