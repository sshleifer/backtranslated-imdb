It should be assumed that those who hailed this film ("The Greatest Opera Ever Shot", did not read it somewhere?) Either do not care about the opera or do not care about Wagner or care about anything but their desire to appear cultured. Either as a representation of a Wagnerian swan song, or as a film, this astonishes me as an unambiguous disaster, with a pioneering reading of the result consistent with a deceptive perception of the counterpart. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people who have ideas about what opera (or play, especially the Shakespeare play) should be "turned around" anywhere near the theater or film studio; Syberberg decided, in a very modern way, but Without the slightest justification of Wagner's text, that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the final stages, becomes a sort of beatnik babe, although the person who continues to sing high-tenor - Singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, a conductor, who is seen as a face (but not heard) for Amfortas, Every scary in a double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who At Monsalvat while playing music Good Friday - which, incidentally, is represented by the love of the inherited nature by scattering flowers vendors and knives soft stuck in unsuitable grass place, which means bewilders me. In the theater, we sometimes have to deal with these flaws with our ideas, but I can not think why Seperberg could not adapt to the mountain pastures of Parcival and Gornmans, and she was providing the music of Julie Andrews. . <br /> <br /> Sound is hard to endure, and high sounds and horns in particular possess an ear glow that adds another kind of tiredness to our impatience through unscrupulous behavior and revelations of rituals. Another person mentioned in another review was the 1951 Bairuit record, but Knobbers Bush, though often very slow, had exactly what Jordan lacked, a sense of pulse, a sense of receding and a flow of music - and half a century later, The group, in modern clicks, surpasses this film.
