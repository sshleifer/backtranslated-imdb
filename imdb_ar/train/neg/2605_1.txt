Although I recently included this in the list of the 10 worst films, I must say that it is probably not worse than Burt Reynolds in The Maddening series or any of the series "Look Who's Talking". Still, it is nauseating, even as the dramatic Drew Barrymore played a part of the horror film on Holly Julietly, moving from New York City to Los Angeles but found to be following a deadly look. Poor Sally Kellerman, the foreign actress who was highly praised in the 1970s, has been reduced to a trifling supporting role. Barrymore's prominent man George Newburn is the worst kind of sitcom actor, and always stops laughing after every line. The picture is murky, but the shower scene with the shower is brilliant, and the person's psychological identity (although coming straight out of the Scooby Doo episode) is interesting. But for the seal ... Be real! Who had to clean up that mess? * from ****
