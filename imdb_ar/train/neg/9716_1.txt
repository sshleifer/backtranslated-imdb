This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is full of holes, and the story is like a bad reproduction of a fishy film and bad actors seem to read directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Gothenburg. He plays his character as if he were in the Police Academy - the same stupid asshole - and this is not appropriate for a leading man in what should have been an exciting film. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Hanson will make "LA Confidential" 10 years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a plague ...
