First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian school I attended. Needless to say, I was scared of the mind. Not because it was scary but because the content. Cmon ... I was 7 years old. Anyway, filming was so bad and I was acting with cheese. This is very bad since I was 7 years old and I remember that. The only thing that still bothers me is that the awful song "I wish we were all ready" where the chorus ended with "... I left behind you" I would not suggest seeing this one. Maybe I'll do, just for nostalgia. Besides, I'm sure that the remake is much better. The best part of this film, must be when everyone "disappears"; vacant cars crashing, lawnmower acting on their own ... very hilarious.
