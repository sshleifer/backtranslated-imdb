Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel with budgets of about $ 2 million. Some of the effects are comprehensive, while others are characterized by distinguishable models and others that distinguish both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr Hines initially claimed that the film was allocated for $ 20 million, but it is painfully clear that it was produced for $ 750,000 if not much less. A few sets are used, a number of scenes are depicted on the green screen, and most of the effects appear to be incomplete and amateur. <br /> <br /> It's painful to see them. Not so much because it is badly directed, poorly executed or misleading, but because many of us are following the progress of this production for some time and have high hopes in this film despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believe in this film when it was originally announced have joined the hordes of those with whom I spoke PT Barnum.
