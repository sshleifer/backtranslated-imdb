This movie was absolutely ... ah I can not find the floor Oh wait ... nonsense! I mean when it seemed like yes, that looks good and then it was very boring. I almost slept, and I had nothing to do with the fact that I was caught late because it was completely dirty. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best but the cast could not rise to the original Sholay crew level and I mean what he was thinking of doing again. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Lili Bhansani and win all the prizes next year as he did with Black? Ajay and this other guy was good especially the other guy who played raj music because among them it was he who looked at him. What was Amitabh doing? He destroys his dignity by doing all these stupid movies. First Nishabd then Cheen Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this means that hes collecting a little of his money and moving away from Bollywood as much as possible before he loses all his respect and I tell you he has exceeded half of it. I mean, all of this is really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who got a good name now because of the fall of Amitabh. I never liked him because he thought he was a god and I know that Abhishek will be in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend on something good, watch Heyy Babyy because this is the best movie ever and it's the number one on the charts!
