I am at this very moment discussing whether I should even finish watching this "poppycock" movie. They had a very interesting idea, with a buried film set, and it was so. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is a buried group, some wolves headed by the monster running Amok, an amulet, and a group of bad actors who are attacked by the Mystery Wolf whatever. What I would miss, if I had a good feeling to get out this nonsense is chasing thick buggy, some very bad, some incredibly stupid dialogue, bad more CG, and fighter fighting papers. Unlike the original idea, this movie has no value to recover value. My fault is to continue watching. - Merck
