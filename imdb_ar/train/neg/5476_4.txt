I do not know if this is an original SyFy Channel movie, but that's exactly what you feel. It's a cheap, low-cost film that has been produced very quickly, with funny effects, a lame dialogue and a mysterious dim star to give him some recognition of the brand name (funny 90210 children are doing cheap TV now). <br /> <br /> Ian Zirring plays the role of Curtis, whom we know from history as the explorer who wiped out all the indigenous people while conquering parts of North America. Here, he does not play as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a petty opportunist; he is likely to kill his character if it is not based on a historical figure. In this story, Curtis performs a short survey, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves funding for exploring America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztec plagued by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the real hero of the story is Lieutenant Rios, who proved to be a wise, wise and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every position, which puts him in opposition to Curtis, as well as ambitious young Aztec Shaman. Of course, the original girl who is supposed to marry the novices, falls with the shamans on Rios, which has increased his anger towards Spanish strangers. So everything is pretty clich√©. Dinosaurs are sent relatively easily. Although it occurs in an area that looks wide open, the story is largely speaking either in the forest or in the Aztec village for 95% of the time, so it is not visually spectacular either. <br /> <br /> I did not even know Ian Zering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing tone, and somehow disappeared. It does not seem or sounds Spanish for the second, however, the choice of choice is wrong in everything. If this movie has been introduced in a theatrical way, it has been chosen for the film Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> In general, it can be forgotten.
