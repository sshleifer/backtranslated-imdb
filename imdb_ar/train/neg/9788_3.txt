I do not like children's movies, but this was a tear with little ransom qualities. MG Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was lost. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but not given the chance in this film. It is sugar coated sugar and will hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years old. See Toy Story or Monsters Inc. Or Shrek instead. 10/03
