Hmmm ... Where to start? How did a serious actress such as Demi Moore get involved in such crap? The "first blood" may be classified as a bull but this kind of nonsense is just a rambo with breast. Of course, if you're interested in the purse (Demi Moore just wants to prove that women can be part of the sea seals) which are the most stupid cliches I can think of, GI Jane will say a wonderful film. Viggo Mortensen's performance has made this film possible, but in hell, I can not think Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not during the last 30 minutes useless). Ridley Scott does not deserve the appropriations to make this film one of the films for women with equal rights. It's just irrational propaganda for the US military to make it more attractive. Horrible movie.
