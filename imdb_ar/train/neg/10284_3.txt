After seeing men behind the sun, I think I hope there will be an evolution of style and technique to match the larger size of this film. I was very interested in seeing someone make a fictional story based on the facts of what happened during these most famous atrocities in Japan, but that is not the case. This is like a Nazi-era film of exploitation from mid-to-mid-seventies - for example, an SS experience camp (perhaps more like a woman already excluded from a special section). It has given him more room and more people to run, but he resorts to the same ruthless, ruthless apparatus that includes many unsympathetic representatives who fall into the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, traumatized by erratic sequential execution. The terrible documentary footage is almost recognized between scenes that have been so penetrated that even these real images are stolen much of their power. Watch Channel 4 "The Holocaust" (recently released) still works?), As of 1 July 2006) of a really disturbing documentary about the evils of war (characterized by excellent use of context for actual footage). This is the kind of treatment worthy of Nanjing horror, not this vulgar exploitative waste (a better exploiting film minus that the disrespectful use of stock sections was fine, but again this is not a very good exploit film). Rating: 3 (5 as a treatment, 1 as a treatment for the subject).
