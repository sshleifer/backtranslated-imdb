Vanity fire is a film steeped in sweat flop. I can not remember any film that tried hard to be very rude, provocative and important, but it failed in all areas. It's like a stand-up comedian who does not laugh, but he can not leave the theater. The more difficult a film is, the more laughter it makes. The despair of the film is so blatant that it is almost unfortunate for all concerned. <br /> <br /> The movie only achieves a loud sound twice. Once in the sight of Geraldo Rivera, he plays repulsive, arrogant and immoral TV newspapers - which is funny just because he does not seem to realize he is playing himself. Another scene worth laughing at is the final "big moment" of the film, where Morgan Freeman's judge delivers the sacred lecture on morality ("That's what Mama learned!"). The moment is an insult to the absurd. <br /> <br /> However, one has to admit that it is a noble effort. It has a good collection of actors trying to get characters out of the fine cartoon, if not well represented. The film is professionally made and the films of director Brian DiPhalma thrive, if not particularly effective. But the film, which seems to want to be a comment on modern ethics and ethics, never appears above the level of animation. Spelling requires style. A farce requires energy. So the sitcom requires timing. But the best that Bonfires can summon is desperation. In the end, do not want to laugh, you just want to get away.
