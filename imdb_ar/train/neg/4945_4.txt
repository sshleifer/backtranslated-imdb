Sure, this is not really a popular film, nor is it aimed at such a situation. "Dieter" is the first name of one of the most popular German musicians who loves or dislikes them because of some kind of representation and that's exactly what this film is about. It depends on the biography "Dieter Bohlen" written a few years ago but is not intended to be accurate in it. The film is full of some offensive sexual content (at least for the American standard) that is either amusing (and not for other "actors" of course) or stupid - depending on your own type of humor or "Bohlen" is a fan. Technically there is not much cash. Talk about me I find this movie to be a good film.
