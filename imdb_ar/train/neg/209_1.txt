I could not stand to watch the happy days after Chashi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this film was seen by Scott Bayou (Scouting Skate Scene!). Judy Foster turned in her first role as a "grower" in her usual professional performance but this is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours of my life I will never go back to it! No remarkable characters, an incredible story, a dubious release and a terrible cinematic film, but worst of all, I could not have less care. The story of California youth in the 1970s, where children live miserable lives and all their parents are stupid. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
