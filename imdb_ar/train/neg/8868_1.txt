Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Representation, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, line plot. In fact I can not say anything positive about it, although I enjoy Swedish movies. The scenes of fighting are so silly that it is impossible to take them seriously. When it happens that a lead lead to losing his shirt, while avoiding lead in a strip bar, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks they are components in a good movie? Regina Lund is the only half-actress actress, but they disappear in a flood of spoken words and incredible reactions. Makes you terrified that someone has spent time and money on something like this ...
