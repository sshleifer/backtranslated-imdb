As long as there was a 3D technique (I think the 1950s) there was a cartoon dedicated to it. I remember specifically, a cartoon of Donald Duck with Chip and Dale. I do not remember the name right now, but the plot was that Donald was working in the circus, and he was feeding the peanut elephant and Chip and Dale were stealing peanuts. This was presented for viewing in 3D perhaps 1960. If you encounter the Meet the Robinsons 3D in the theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin. Maybe there are about 100 comics made specifically for viewing through 3D glasses. This was a bad step because it was not difficult to prove their mistake. Moreover, this sounds like a bad film.
