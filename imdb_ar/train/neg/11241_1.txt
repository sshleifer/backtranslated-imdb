If you're looking for eye candy, you might enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is a video game injected into artists' performance. The visials are nice and interesting to look at throughout the entire film. Now, knowing that the pictures are the only good thing in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes later, I learned that I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I hoped this film would improve, but it did not achieve any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to go out and grow continued. Now, I own more than 2000 films and probably watched five times that number. However, this is the only second film in which I felt out of my entire life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- Nothing. The three main performance is pitiful. Good Lou (also in the other film I wanted to release) is just terrifying in a starring role. Better sit across Ben Affleck in Gigli instead of watching Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries hard to be in a camp, which has the opposite effect on her face. The last article I read said that Paltrow was thinking of staying at home and being a mother instead of acting. After this performance, I would like to salute this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- The soap opera was written better. The story behind Sky Captain begins badly and continues to worsen as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Output --- None. Everything has been put into the special effects of that story, where acting and direction are acting very much. Even "The Phantom Menace" had a better role in acting and that did not mean much. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie "0" from "10". Avoid paying theater prices and wait until the video is posted.
