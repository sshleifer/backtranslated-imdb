After seeing "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this movie is horrifying, even if it values ​​against the low "standards" of the time. Of course everything is completely fabricated and prejudices. This is what one expects from German propaganda in 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is penetrating and cheap. It is so ironic that even the modern Germans have to leave the theater carrying their noses. In this genre famous for its basic attractiveness, lack of originality and wrong error, this film is not considered "bad". It will have to greatly improve access to this situation!
