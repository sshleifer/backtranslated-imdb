I am a big fan of the comic book series, but this film has fallen short of my expectations. I was expecting to have some kind of heavy metal 2000 ..... slow motion, bad dialogue and lots of blood ... but that was worse than anything I'd ever imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the comic line, but the good points are pretty much there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that caught my attention in the comic series. The film covers only a small part of the comic film, the user part is more slow and boring than the subsequent parts. The focus of the film is on unimportant events rather than on the most comprehensive plot of the comic book. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been great. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so there is now another terrible film that few will see and will love less. My copy will definitely collect the dust for years until I finally release it.
