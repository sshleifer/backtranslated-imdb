* Can anyone tell me where is the comedy? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedy artist, (Thomas Hadden's Church) looks very weak (with him!), and the whole thing is full of heads! <br /> <br /> * Have they tried to prepare a direct comic book turned into a bloody comic nightmare and was not funny? Like the plan scene in the bathroom; it was very good with her cinematic imagination but nothing else .. except the pain! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is actually a kind of work they just did to make it and earn some money from it, but it became a crime when this money was stolen from us who were deceived by the very low artworks, Entertainment at all! <br /> <br /> Well, it would be uglier if it was a big production and Brando starred in his movie The Golden Years with a Real Star. <br /> <br /> * The Shin family is here. Just be aware of it! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who has found himself a fan of this movie or - God forbid -! Then you should go directly to the treatment before it becomes more dangerous and hurt anyone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius but the film is not! He did not intend to be one here after reading this for sure! But the big big problem is that no one else has worked in this thing as he tries or wants to have a smart little time or even good !!! (Sorry I'm crying now! Torture film is unbelievable!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) (Mira Sorfino) hits her shoes! It was very realistic! Maybe he saw himself in it, and he punished himself for being in such nonsense! <br /> <br /> * For a billion times: this could have been better (or worse!). The script, even the train robbery, was nice, and I imagined they would escape from another chase (Smokey and the Bandit) but with (Brando) as a police chief. In fact, none of those monsters was much merciful than I saw! <br /> <br /> Why did not this masterpiece receive any prize from the Razzie Awards?! Want to make me think there is less film than this? I do not think so ! It's a situation that Razzie's supervisor should win one for neglecting !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Shen is also here as a guest star perhaps to support his failed son but ironically that the father was a failure like his son! and why is that ?! Okay ! Because I hate Martin Shen probably more than I hate comics were not as good as her ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy film, no .. It's a horror film, and I hate horror movies especially those that have been promoted as comics! <br /> <br /> * Name a good thing about this topic? Hmmm! Well, this film compared to another film by the Marlon Brando monster (Dr. Morrow Island - 1996) will be close to Casablanca! <br /> <br /> Note: If you still want to know what is or who is exactly bad, ugly and extremely ugly in this movie .. Just pray your last prayers and go to watch it .. Awn God. You are!
