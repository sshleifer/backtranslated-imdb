In the recent biography of Alec Guinness, I have not found much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness did the movie for a free trip to Paris from it. The film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris was of course superbly photographed with the wonderful opening of Gennes and his son leading the Champs Elys√©es with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, he descended from there. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Guinness and the little girl he met in Paris. According to the recent biography of the Guinness Encyclopedia by Pierce Paul Reid, Guinness positively found the girl, found her behavior unprofessional. For Odile Vernois's opinion of her star partner, there is no available record. They have a lot of chemistry like two neutral cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the film, which was independent of one of Ealing's comedy films, climbing a tree as he tries to recover the feather. But I will not wait for the film for him. <br /> <br /> At least, Alec got a trip to Paris outside the deal.
