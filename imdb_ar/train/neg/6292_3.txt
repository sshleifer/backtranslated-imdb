I wonder if this film is actually related to 1984's "Party Party" starring Tom Hanks. Is this film even a formal sequel? This film lacks every section, and obviously you are better off not watching it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this film is not good or funny enough. Often based on stereotypical personality ratings, instead, the film actually presents some good, innovative and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course there is also a very short story of the event and a nude film story about the pages of the script. You just keep waiting for things to finally start. There is a major landline somewhere, but this line is terribly unfamiliar and very badly executed in the film so it looks more like something that does not exist. I think there's a moral message and story somewhere, but again this is very uncommonly familiar and poorly executed in the film so it does not work simply. <br /> <br /> It's a typical teen comedy, a lot of sexual jokes and nudity, only without the main characters in the teen, making the story more sad and tasteless. The film makes some really wrong jokes, which are misplaced for any kind of film. <br /> <br /> I am sorry to see this at all. <br /> <br /> 3/10
