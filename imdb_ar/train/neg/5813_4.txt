Tierney is a strong authentic man, but this film misled by the competent RKO usually reduces its impact at every turn. Reasonable script like OJ Simpson at Dinner Ten Cmmandments. Just count the times when the astonishing owners in Terni swallow a lame excuse after another for his elusive and violent actions. Old clich√©s on the subject "Only Happens in the Movies" apply here in the scoops. Then there is the man who plays the role of the keeper, who seems to be wandering in the thriving WC Fields comedy, which has destroyed the mood in danger in the process. The fixed sets of one room do not help either, and the apparent lack of Feist output does not help this article. Then add a last car chase that lacks both imagination and payment, and the results are very flat. In fact, the film is captured only in the scenes of the station's house where police with strong bites discover the hidden powers of an innocent-looking gas station. Too bad that Tiny's career never materialized. I have gathered that the reason for this is largely due to being a strong man outside the screen as with a scraping shaken after another. The ice-cold approach and the clarity of sentiment remind me of Marvin's best times. In any case, this project may have been a radio show, but as a film with a promising title, it is disappointing.
