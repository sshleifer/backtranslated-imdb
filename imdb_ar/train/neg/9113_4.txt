They had such a potential for this film and they fall perfectly. In the first harsh intentions, we left wondering what prompted leading figures to become as they are and act in the way they work. There is almost no evolution at all in this package. It's really a very sad story but this film did nothing to me. It was as if they had ruled out good writing instead of unnecessary words. The end is meaningless at all and does not explain anything. The writing was very bad. The other thing that bothered me was that they used the lease 3 of the "exact" lines that were originally. Like "boy down", or kissing scene, a few others I can not remember. I was never affected by Robin's behavior, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that reconciled this film.
