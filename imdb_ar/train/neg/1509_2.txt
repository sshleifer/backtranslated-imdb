I really have problems rating this movie. They are brilliantly directed, obviously there is a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (though their screen character may use more selection and spice), but editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those really sick films where one can only wonder if the director himself likes to show certain scenes, and yes, one can not help but wonder how many copies will be inspired by these films. /> <br /> In purely technical terms, it's 9 years, but I really have to ask myself who these people are offering their money to produce such a film ....
