Well, because I'm a musician I thought maybe I'll check this movie on TMC, nothing else is good. One of the worst mistakes in my life so far, only half is done. I seriously thought she was one of those soft core movies with a crappy plot and a crappy acting, a crappy portrayal and a crappy effects. But no, I do not get that fun. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping maybe some laugh, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw one liner or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction begins. Or maybe something better. Now I can sit here writing until I have 10 lines
