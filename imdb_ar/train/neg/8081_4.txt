One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it becomes a satire, is that it is fairly reasonable. I think a counter-material bomb would do much more damage than it did. But I will leave it to the physicists who may have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> It is a crisis faced by the Earth because the solar bombs are completely out of control. They are so close to the ground that the air is unreasonably hot, as if the whole earth were the valley of death. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that the spacecraft must take to the sun and explode there. This will turn the light signals into a direction Mercury says, provided it is not directly in line with Earth. <br /> <br /> Who delivers it, but Commander Tim Matheson and his crew. This is if he can put his mind on business at hand and not on his fugitive son, Corinne Nemek. Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father, and Oded Nimek take care of the personal side of family problems. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, CEO of a multinational company trying to control the world's food supply to survivors. The idea that he may not survive does not enter his mind. He is doing his best to sabotage the mission of Mathison. <br /> <br /> It seems that the solar power crisis was a bad combination of 2001, the space and space Odys to the seabed. It seems that Boyle draws his attention from Jane Hackman in the role of Lex Luthor in Superman, and appears to be the only cast in the cast who realizes that he is in Turkey and outperforms it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, real blue and boring. Except perhaps Desert Mouse Jack Palance who finds Nemek and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the movie was directed by the famous Hollywood financier, Alan Smith. The film gets up to four stars for the actors involved, and it was timely to carve Thanksgiving.
