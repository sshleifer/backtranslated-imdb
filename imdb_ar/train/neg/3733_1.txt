Poor, meaningless, tired, vulgar; wants to be a basic instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for new perspectives, new insights. False, vulgar, grotesque, and without the potential value of brevity; oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... it should have just looked * for a longer time! Better clean the bus station toilets using my toothbrush rather than having to sit back. I say here: I think that means I did not like it.
