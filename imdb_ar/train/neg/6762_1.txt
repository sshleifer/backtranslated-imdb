This is the kind of film that should embarrass everyone involved. Weak guidance, on top of representation, and a plot torn apart in vain only to show violence. I thought when I first saw it might be a satire from the media and how violence appears but it is not. I'm not sure which makes the film worse. Oliver Stone does his worst directing at all. One of the scenes in which Woody Harrelson's face turns without reason or Robert Downey Jr.'s terrifying performance, like Wayne Gill, a reporter who seems completely outcast, is a mess.
