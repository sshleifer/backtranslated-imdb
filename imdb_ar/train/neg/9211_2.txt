This film reminds me of many anti-drug films in the 1950s and 1960s because of the fact that it was made by people who did not experience the social evil they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends "play roles," but there are no replies, lots of candles, and then you were swept up with a bad montage showing that Hanks waives the lady in the group. Very funny but misleading. I wonder how many poor children have been devastated by R & D and have been told that the use of their imagination is the path to destruction. As a film, it's basically a special event after school, misconduct (although Hanks shows some of his talent) and relationship conversations, and no one seems to be enjoying himself. These films seem to have a psychological focus on adolescents who are starting their way toward adults, which is probably the most dangerous thing, and requires you to bend and do what others do. Despite my 2B vote, this is worth seeing because of its unique genre and scary movies, which I find very funny.
