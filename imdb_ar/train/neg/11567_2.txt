I decided to watch this series after seeing so endless ads on the BBC in the weeks before its start. I have seen it despite the fact that I do not like the kind of buzz of things written by Alan Hollinghurst (sorry for his fans but I think we have a new emperor's garb with the work of this author). I admit that the acting is great, it was beautifully filmed, and I felt reasonably fun - yet - I found that the story of the film was very high and after watching the three episodes I feel dissatisfied with this somewhat empty production. The "frank" sex that the media has been around on television has been - several times - so it was not so terrible I'm afraid. Full marks of production values ​​but low for a story / content I fear.
