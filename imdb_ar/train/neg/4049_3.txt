I did not like this Bill Murray when it was originally released in the 1980s, so I tried to see it again to see if my harassment of this movie dates back to my 1980's or Stripes was just a bad movie. Well, the rule exists and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 1980s, and may appeal to people who have passed basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but the film is still bad. <br /> <br /> Why is this bad? Mostly because the "stripes" are supposed to be a comedy but they are not funny. There is some laughter, but it is few and far between. Most of the film is consumed by a dramatic plot that is incredibly cabbage and very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially remarkable if you are familiar with more contemporary comedy films such as "Anchorman" which seeks laughter in every part of the film. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" suffer from Bill Murray and Harold. Ramis' lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he has not been a very convincing dramatist at this stage of his career, and Harold Ramis plays the role of Harold Ramis. These two are not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic bow of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy in the movie "Stripes" revolves around self-centered and self-centered Bill Murray, so if you do not find that character funny (like I did not), you will not find most What's in "Stripes" is a funny little comedy. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a film of his time, not too old and not worth watching. If you want to watch "Friends" comedy in the early 80's, I recommend Crazy Stir. Like "Stripes", the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes", it has advanced at a much better age, and as a result is still enjoyable.
