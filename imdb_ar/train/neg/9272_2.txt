I recently decided to re-visit the Omen trio just to discover that {insert music demonic here} is a fourth. I did not expect much from him, and in this regard definitely lived up to my expectations. If you're watching bad movies, it might be right for you. Oh, where do we start? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the "make-to-TV" look and feel was obvious. The music was often incompatible with what was happening in the film and (at best) distracting. The whole scenario was a thriller of the 8-year-old fantasy. But the only thing to say is that the missing text was well matched with the appalling representation. Many scenes have left me wondering whether the script or acting is the source of irony. <br /> <br /> The story itself is very subtle, focusing on all the crazy alien of Damien Thorne's daughter, who was adopted by mistake and nuns behaved badly. There are a lot of usual mysterious deaths that made me personally yawn when I started "drama" and the usual third party investigator in the whole case. Later, by some medical phenomena, Damien Thorne Jnr was born. This largely ends the plot. The whole thing is pretty badly done from the start with no suspense that makes the film an interesting and / or ironic scene after another. <br /> <br /> There were many WTF?!? Moments also provide unintended comic relief. For example, what is the main overreaction at the beginning of the film when the child deceives the mother's cheek? Barely omen 360 degrees turning head. She also laughed at the excessive reaction to baptism. The child is crying, everyone seems very worried. The sad mother runs out of the church and leaves the priest deeply concerned as he crosses himself. Hey? Then there is the New Age nanny who seems to have an eclectic blanche on exposing the 8-year-old to all kinds of alternative spirituality. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing Dylia to the troubled psychic gallery to meet Hippy's friends in the nanny and the mother shrugged her shoulders and allowed it. "Yes, that's wonderful, fill my 8-year-old's troubled head with all these mystical things, that's great, I do not need to be there." Of course, this is expected of a mother who allows her daughter to adopt the full-grown Rottweiler you encounter on the street and who can bite young girls heading for a snack. The whole scene in the psychological exhibition is very comic in a slapy way, from the terrible retro stars of mediators to Delia, to the hell that followed. <br /> <br /> She also laughed at how the nun's death was considered a "strange accident." Here we have a religious fanatic (who is described as part of a cult), who preaches passionately in a pit full of snakes to prove how God's glory will protect them. They prepare snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW is bitten several times. Barely a strange accident. It's like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The sight of snakes versus Nun was not the only comic death. There is a slow-moving car accident leading to a head-off in the school's parking lot. Then there is a slow demolition ball headed directly to the detective. I think I probably went and prepared the coffee when the slow motion just started to go back to see the demolition ball still heading directly to the "concerned" detective. Then there is the ideal vulgar who shot him, where a gun goes off and they both work as if they had fired for a few seconds while exchanging terrifying looks. Then someone drops on the stairs to reveal the real victim. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed very strange and meaningless to me. Running looking at the architecture of the church. He obviously found this very sad, and finally collapsed, and grabbed his chest and died. Apparently there was something demonic going on, because that's what music suggests. Emm. Okay. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have reviewed this movie positively, in particular, as a "worthy sequel". It is difficult not to notice non-sensual text, unrealistic representation and inappropriate musical result. The film lacks any suspense, and relies heavily on Delia's "devilish stare" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes troublesome after a short while. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a bad film with the only recapitulation feature being an unintended possibility of being a comedy.
