Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel (although I think it's now called Syfy?) The original movie I've seen in my life. But I have seen one or two others since then, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but that person really removes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI was poorly executed, the representation bad, the text ridiculous, and what happens in the end is unexpected and incorrect (if you see Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I did not want to put the spoiler in my assessment). In addition, there was this musical tone that was used in each sequence very seriously. It was really stupid; they played it over and over again. It is certainly not original; I know I heard it somewhere before (I can not remember where). This is the one to avoid.
