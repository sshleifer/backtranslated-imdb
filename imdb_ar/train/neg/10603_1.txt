I tried to watch this movie twice and every time I still can not access the final credits. The first time I managed to sit through the first battle sequence then I lost interest. The second time I was able to force myself to digest over hours of lousy representation, SFX lame and a very bad trend. Pale compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the abysmal failure of the Atari 2600 old? For those who did not allow me to pack you up. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office smashing of all time ... Atari decides to launch a game linking movies on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially painful story, the game has turned a lot of time and caused thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be dumped in landfills because they could not even give it up let alone sell it. /> What the global soldier: return has to do with this story? See class 3.2 and find it yourself. <br /> <br /> A terrible film ... IMDb forced me to give it 1 out of 10 because its rating systems do not reach zero, let alone the negatives.
