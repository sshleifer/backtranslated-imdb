Although this is the "best" of the first molva (which does not say much anyway, I prefer to see dry paint) is still absorbed. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget people. I was pleased when buying a few DVDs to support some Andy filmmakers and boy I'm so sorry. Some of them have not yet been officially released (and none like the makers of the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even describe how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indie movies that are friends. If you are a friend of these guys, you probably have been in their movies and enjoyed making them. But for those who had to watch it? Not possible. Bad video, bad voice, bad representation, bad scheme ... etc. This is not funny. This was given only one 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it and this is about it. Maybe not worth even 2. About 1/16 star to show it was a little better than the first (which I wish I had classed in negatives). If you want a good movie without a budget, go to some LBP Friends in Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or Raising the Stakes. Those are actually decent.
