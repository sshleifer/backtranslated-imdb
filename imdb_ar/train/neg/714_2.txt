It's a tired cliche film, but it's a weird childhood. There is a master of Nazi witch-related performance tests in the sixth basement? I beg you! <br /> <br /> Designed to a false sense of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is that the concept of fear is very immature. With no preconceived expectations, remains in front of me: a grand old-timer of Buffy and a hero with a monkey-like face who does not seem to know how to act. Said Adrian Barbou has only met me before in "Avian Women in the Avocado Forest of Death". <br /> <br /> The camera adds and adjusts to the overall impression of laziness.
