I honestly can not believe what it is going to entertain now. Death (and irony of death), violence, sexual connotation, adults who threaten children, rudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, disordered parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat, From home at midnight - yes, it certainly sounds like a movie to my kids - no !!! In addition, the dark and frightening elements - a dead woman who owns a house and turns into a house and keeps her beloved husband imprisoned for more than 20 years, and a whole life is a tragedy - what is sweet for children. Parents - Is this really what you want your children to see - is that what you want to learn about life?! <br /> <br /> This movie is very scary for young children, and I'm afraid teenagers today might live some of this movie scenario - why rub it in their faces? For an adult audience - you will not find it scary or fun - just boring, intriguing and predictable. The characters are wrong - ignorant parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, bad incubators and manipulations, drinking beer / girlfriends and girlfriends. What wonderful materials for children - does this really look like a children's movie to anyone? Even computer animations and good audio work are not enough to recover this terrible thing. Save money, Save time, Save your children's minds - Go to Ice Age Rent, Monsters Inc. , Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - none of which is much better than this hideous movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you to commit such a disaster and then describe it as a film for children / family !!
