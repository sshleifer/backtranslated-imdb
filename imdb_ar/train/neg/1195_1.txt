This is the worst film I have ever seen. I can not say how bad it is. I frankly wanted to kill myself several times through this horrible experience just to get the pain end. Instead of seeing this film, I recommend bathing in acid, then you will know at least a small part of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had great expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when he initially added that Jesus was following them, I was very excited ... Then in the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a 23 minute introduction to the most disturbing characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash. At least they had thrown out the feces and some blurred rubbish. It would have made it better not to see any of the horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not get jokes, they were not only funny, and repeated themselves like twenty times. It seems that nothing is funny unless I've seen it a million times. <br /> <br /> You do not see this under any circumstances. People rated "Manos the Hands of Fate" as the worst film in the world. I've seen it too and agree it's bad ... but unfortunately, it's the worst. "Greasy bus driving" much worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves all kinds of harsh language, but I can not write it here, so imagine I swear a whole bunch.
