Both spiritual and non-Christian. I thought I would be really committed to my faith, but what a burden of me. I thought that the film would have great arguments, but only got the views of atheists and Jews ??? And who are all these people whom he meets in the streets, and who know not the backs of their arms from their heads? Where the proper theologians and priests were and what things he could have obtained. He was not retired from books books and completed his studies in 1970. Someone this DVD was a waste of time and it was not worth my time to check whether the facts were true or false or if I should or should not believe because the anti-Christ told me thus. Please think that he came to the conclusion that God was not found because the ego and his demons were better than him. No, I'm not saying that the film was amazing to help atheists read this feeling good about themselves. But if you really want to show the world that you care about our poor lives that believe in Jesus, you will attract us to your worth, and not beat the drums.
