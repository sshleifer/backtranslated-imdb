Complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera targets women. I'm fine with these night soap, like Gray's Anatomy, Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are interesting stories even taking into account that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels with daytime soap that is designed to just put rich men (Tay Deigs, Tim Daley, and Chris Lowell) in sexual and romantic tension, many silly hard situations in a small hospital called ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch. This was what the men wanted and had, so if that was what the women wanted, the idea that this was a high forehead (or something that men would see) was unrealistic.
