The bad news is that it is still really appalling. I've given him number 2 because sometimes it seems that some funny comic parody looks funny. <br /> <br /> You should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and you must reward progress. Or maybe I drank heavily when I saw him and felt generous. Whatever, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it is extremely fast. It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's main themes to watch, sneak, drown in the dirt, hide the dialog box, and bring the entire mess into about an hour of truly terrifying amateur videos. <br /> It is best to smoke a lot in something strong if you want to enjoy this thing. Get this DVD to your video store on time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay late fees.
