It seems that the wonderful team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this letter somewhere overseas and possibly to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of any of the many tedious but promising things to begin with, but predictable during a single season of clicks from David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy situations they get are very strange and hardly raise sympathy or sadness. This is already what makes a good medical drama - the dramatic positions you are afraid of, "this may be me". It's not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good, but the lines are dead and can not be returned to live. I am a therapist, let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the role of an incompetent, immoral and uneducated therapist. All those who write their purposes fail ethics and transfer / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give him a code of conduct to read it (the episode with the wife bleeding from the nose and the involvement of the therapist in it). There are no therapists so bad. <br /> <br /> The women who yearn for the men who moved - were done to death, we all graduated "sex and the city". Edison in her young aggression on the man she loves - not very suitable for age, seems very abnormal for a woman over the age of forty, and this talented actress otherwise does not believe it herself and does not offer well. The only successful / palatable developments are Addison, who is struggling for her decision to move to Los Angeles, the Voodoo Doctor and deal with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept may work with a whole new writing team.
