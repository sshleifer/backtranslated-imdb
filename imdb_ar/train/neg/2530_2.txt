This film was deep. Not as good as some have claimed. The first of the main character is ginger is very unattractive. II-WTF is being with this love fan. The plot, basically, is: that the boy wants to have sex, so he buys a car (which is very cool). Incredibly looking it looks like Newt records with lots of chicks! And failed with some. He then records with a really hot chick and realizes that he loves this dowry bird who has played hard to get it. Then drag racing with her boyfriend hot chicks. He tips his car. At this point Danny Davito saves today. Although he did not need it because it is in the heart of the truck via a baby ginger line first. I was given this 2 * as I was willing to assume that there was some sort of Fanning culture 70 I do not get, and also because there are 70 boobage too.
