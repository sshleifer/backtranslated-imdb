I watched this movie on a local television station ("Big Chuck and Little John" on TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio) I never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know which treasure can come close to helping me describe how bad this film really is. The scenario is terrible. Representation, unlike one of two exceptions, is futile because nothing in this article deserves any real effort. <br /> <br /> It seems like a bunch of small ideas, remnants of different writing sessions, thrown into a mixer. It's not just funny. The "spoof" side is strained at best. Some references are almost expired (even for the time they are issued). No wonder I never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything. Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even In Living color in their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you see him on TV, a great example of how not to make a movie. Everything you do does not destroy cents. <br /> <br /> Adam
