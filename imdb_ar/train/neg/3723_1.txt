The denominations that benefit from this film are well known for their claim to taking the "message" of the Bible without any change or influence outside the Bible. The reason for the existence of this film is only due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the new-born section of Christianity was playing in the 1970s, just look for the word "rapture" in the dictionary of sects and denominations. It is faster than sitting during a celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Poor representation, unequal sound quality, and text that could be just as much as Jack T Chick wrote (the paranoid Christian conspiracy scene for those who are not familiar with the evangelical scene). You can not really put this in the category of "Too bad it's good", so its only audience is those who have a set of brochures looking to get out or into paranoia.
