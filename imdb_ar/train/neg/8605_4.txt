This is the Gore Festival of the late 1980s interestingly enough some bad mollusks with a taste for human blood. If you can overcome the absurdity of the whole thing, you may get some simple pleasure from it. The representation is appalling and the plot simply exists to assemble the film between the sluggish slug attacks, but the film is not a complete waste of time. Special effects are actually very good, and it is done well. Reminds me of Blob's reshaping, perhaps because of the smallness of everything. All in all, you certainly can do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I do not suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and you're in that sort of thing.
