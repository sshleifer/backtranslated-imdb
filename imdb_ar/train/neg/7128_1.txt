I'm a dumb person to rent DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, which made this stupid film, Palisades Media Group, never paid for online advertising at many car sites, including my 16,000 ALEXA. They broke up with the deal and now I'm worth $ 16,000 and they wasted a lot of my personal time (Peter's relationship with Palisades Media) You know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! Suck and the people who stand behind him are shabby artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a group of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
