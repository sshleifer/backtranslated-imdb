The title song for this movie ........... is the greatest free animated song ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in 1978 and 1979 when I first joined the cable. In 1979, the cable had just begun to become a commonplace in homes. (Or at least when it became common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This may be the first movie I've ever seen on the pay-TV channel called "The Movie Channel" Star Channel. At that time, they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" In the early eighties of the 20th century ... I received a free month from The Star Channel through my subscription to the new cable The Van was one of the films that was circulating around this network at that time. > <br /> I remember watching this movie at that time and I think it was a typical teen flick (same vein as a middle budget teen flick) ... those revolving around the plot about nudity I just forgot that this movie was there until I last saw this movie again after I did not see it for decades (I found a copy of it on a DVD for sale in a cheap container) I got to know and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> It seems that I remembered that this movie was much better (he), yet it was again seen as a different experience from watching now (after 30 years). <br /> <br /> It was Enjoy watching children record rock and roll, smoke the herbs, and have sex in the fancy back (often at the same time). This is what a good teen ceremony film should be. <br /> <br /> There is not much conspiracy other than the fact that the main character imagines having sex with his gentle girlfriend and her rivals ... blowing up all of his college savings to buy the Dodge Van deceived (with the walls of a lattice carpet, mirrored roof and waterbed) to attract Her attention, and finally fuck her. But his arch-rival discovers and comes looking for him (so that the two of them can settle their differences by dragging their small car race) .... and ends up with his arch rival to destroy both of their trucks, instead of stealing away his rival rival girlfriend, wins the heart of a girl preppy (less attractive) that half / ass dates in most of the movie and admits it's happier / better off and ends the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has funny moments. But after watching this film 30 years later, it became more than a journey into the memory lane. Because I still remember pizza parlors and pinball alleys, they reminisced about wandering around a small town while we smoked the pot because we would advise the girls who started well and were hoping to get a place (sometimes I'm lucky and get some decent looking for a girl to share with me, And we were playing in the backseat, I also remember many songs in this step (when it was new) ...... This film is a perfect time capsule for that era in those greetings (he brought back a lot of memories) <br /> < > The only thing filmed in this film which frankly I can not remember is .... I did not I never remember the time when full-size trucks were popular because the film portrayed them as being, I remember that era very well, I do not walk around with young people wishing they had a car, and instead I remember young people in the 1970s (including themselves) , Chevy Camaro or hot rod Ford Mustang But without a car, this film makes it seem as if the trucks were the most common and that every young man wanted one (which was not true at that time)
