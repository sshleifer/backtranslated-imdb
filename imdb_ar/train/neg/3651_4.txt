I was expecting a very funny film. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes, and a lot of them did not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would be more fun if they had a new person, rather than a Moriarty revival. Some things were funny. Burt Kwok was very funny, as always. It was clogged on a funny horse. McGarrett was not from Hawaii 5-0 like McGarrett. Connie Booth is very clear with accents. She is from Indiana, but she played English and the New Yorker well. Unfortunately, the script is not much presented. I was expecting a more funny film. Instead, I got a somewhat confusing movie with a bad text writing. Somewhat paradoxical, because both Booth and Kelly were together on this one. Maybe they were about to break up in 77.
