I really do not have anything new to add but I felt I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Awful. I made a MST3K DVD set again and watched Hobgoblins around ten o'clock. It was really really painful, but it was on the next menu ... you can see that there is a small kernel for a real movie buried under all the "Hobgoblins" crap but could not get out. All about this movie is rate 4. The story, acting, effects, women, "motion scenes", and ahhhh forget it. I can see a piece of litter like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (also known as "Zaat") over and over again with hardly any harmful effects (I really like it, BTW, will be on traditional Chinese medicine later this month - October 2009) but "Hobgoblins" is a complete football game. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is that about 12 hours after the movie ended, I slept a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast and my own medicines, as well as the dance music "New Wave" Amy, Red Short, and Laraine Newman in the living room, still spin through my head. This torment will continue for several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, right?
