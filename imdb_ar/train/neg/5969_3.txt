*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you thought about watching this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot can be predicted so that there is no difference if you read this or not) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering if you want to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: No! Not worth the money for a ticket or VHS / DVD. Typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", one might say. The plot itself is as shallow as possible, a ridiculous and non-critical version of the American dream. The small-looking girl from a small town becomes a great success in New York. The few desperate attempts to give the film any depth fail, such as the "tragic" incident of the father, the "difficulties" in the relationship with her boyfriend Violet, and so on. McNally tries to stir up sadness and sadness among the public, and he has no chance of success in this attempt because of the bad scenario and shallow representation. Private Piper Perabo completely fails to convince one of the "Jersey" fear of singing in front of the audience. The only good (and very funny) thing about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents a small ray of hope from this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised, because Jerry Brockheimer produced this film. First "Gone in 60 Seconds" Now that's ... What happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? These were the real things in Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a surface film with beautiful women just for a relaxing evening, you should go and watch Charlie's Angels (it's more fun, fun and self-mockery) instead of this flick. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
