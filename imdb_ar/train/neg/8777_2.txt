Well, I struggled to avoid the fact that in selling EVP as a fact, the film basically lied to me from the start. I've realized it in hell, I do not believe in vampires but I still love Dracula so I can live with it. <br /> <br /> However, even with movie acceptance, the movie is not very good. They have been manufactured and run efficiently, but they do not attract you at all. There were several "jump" moments, and I looked at her and thought, "Yes, I did not expect that" without actually jumping at the lowest level. <br /> <br /> The decision also makes no sense. If the power behind it is capable of doing what it looks like, why does hell need to use an agent? Plus, the end comment was silly. They clearly put it there as part of "giving the film credibility by claiming that everything is real", but to succeed, it must be at first. But they can not put it at first because they are then planning to give them up ... sticking it out in the end makes it look like a painful thumb.
