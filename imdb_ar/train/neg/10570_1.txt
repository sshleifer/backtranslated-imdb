Do not let the MPAA fool you with a "R rating for extreme violence", and certainly there is no extreme violence in this boring tasting of s * t. I was expecting some of the kind of cheap Rambo 3 that the trailer promised, but that's just boring boring nonsense with a ton of slow past memories of stale Mo. Avoid!
