I just hired a creep and was not impressed at all. I did not feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the trouble alone was appalling. <br /> <br /> I left the living room several times in a state of despair that something would happen with this film. Have not we seen all this before? I did not like any of the characters bar man in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But again, I could not think why he survived and was not killed by creeping? Many questions must be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone pointed to PS2 Silent Hill and I can see ambiguous similarities. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a good movie. Judge for yourself.
