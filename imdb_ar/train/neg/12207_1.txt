I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had a Commodore 64 and I love to play Rambo. So I was thrilled when I got to buy this movie at a really cheap price. I put this in my VCR and started: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like three words in the entire film (except for this terrible emotional speech in the end), and he has the same expression on his face all the way. And this stupid love thing in the middle, surprisingly predictable. I just finished reorienting the entire thing and went to share the movie for something else.
