I watched this film in an early preview, and I can not stress enough how much I thought this movie was bad. From the beginning, the audience moaned from the terrifying southern Pachino dialect. He looked really weak, really tough, and I can not decide whether this was intentionally part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he did not sleep before going to the group. But far worse than the vicissitudes of Pacheco is the miserable excuse for a conspiracy. At the beginning of the film, we got signals that the personality of a gay Pacino, I think that's what the scriptwriter originally intended. Later, however, we are supposed to attach our folly and believe that both T Leoney and Kim Basinger (both sleeping during lame roles) lust after this old man, half dead, are inspired by a silly accent. The worst part was the main thread of the scheme, which was about some corporate espionage that was never completely explained and we were never interested in it at all. Since this was a preview, I will keep my final judgment because of the possibility of reboot and edit, but you can bet that I will not pay cents for it in the theaters.
