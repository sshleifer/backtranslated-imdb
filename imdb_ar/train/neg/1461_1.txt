I saw this movie, I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who tries sadly to be Hitler. The film lies, does not reflect the truth. At the scene Hitler was beating the man with his gun. Hitler did not hurt anyone, and will not hit people with his fist, but with fists of soldiers. Understand ?? Another thing is: very obvious, that Hitler is this evil, he was smarter, than described in this film. No German accepted him as a leader, because he could see that he was evil. So Hitler did not show the real evil side of the people. <br /> <br /> Did any Yankees see "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? This is a great movie with great actors. And a German film. I think that the subject of Nazi Germany should not be achieved as a film by people who do not know anything about Germany. People! See "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful film about a very sad period of time for people around the world.
