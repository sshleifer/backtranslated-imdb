There's one good thing about this movie: Don Lola Glaudini! Sorry to be very frank but this is the truth. Too bad did not do nude. Would at least make this mess acceptable. We see the last breast of the chick but it is nowhere near Lola. And a man, is Armand Asante old or what? Man looks like crap! The "result" is the usual movie you expect. The story was possible. They seemed to have good ideas but did not know how to implement them. Filming is just awful. Horrible! The direction is uninspiring and the end result is a thin film with lame shifts and washed actors. Lola Goodini is considered as wonderful as alopecia in a cheap and sound way but does not save the "result" of the garbage and not the ridiculous garbage, just the old stinking garbage.
