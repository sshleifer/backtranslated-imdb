I had the bad luck of catching two of the worst 2004 films to turn back this morning: first, the inconsistent CGI-driven emptiness of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the awkward Vanity Fair project known as Greendale. One of them costs millions of dollars and the other costs pennies, but both are bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> I must mention that I am not one of the greatest fans of Neil Young in the world, but he contributed his share of classical melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (from the best recordings were Young's) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, The man coined some really wonderful songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Gryndale, a few of them are good, and the film they built around is a credible and simple political slogan. Completely without merit, art and as influential as dialectics, it is best to leave Grindel oblivious. Buy the book if you have to contribute to Young's bank account.
