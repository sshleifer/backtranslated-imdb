Definitely one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> Low production values, terrible story idea, poor script, poor representation ... I can not even come up with a descriptive description of how poor the poor are guiding the Joan Ho River. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who financed this movie; prolly directly below the reserved level for the madness of the usurped genocide. <br /> <br /> This movie is the wreckage of a train. <br /> <br /> (very bad) x (infinity) = Rabbit Test. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's very bad, and it's not funny how bad it is.
