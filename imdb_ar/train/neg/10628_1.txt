This alleged "documentary" is trying to tell us that the United States has falsified the moon's descent. General is fine. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has already studied the situation knows differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is definitely a guide. When the astronauts on the moon, they returned many lbs of rocks from the moon - to conduct geological studies. These have spread throughout the world to hundreds of labs, which they have tested. They all concluded that they came from the same planet, not from Earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements differed from those on Earth, but they were similar to those on the moon. Which. The conspiracy theorists did not study anything: they only take the thing that fits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another wrong claim is that the wind was in the barn where they shot the moon, which flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. Well, even if the conspiracy theorists look at the footage, they will see that the science has not moved after the astronaut has allowed it, that is, the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, can not study the subject properly, or study it only to get what they came Tags, so they can lie from it, and make a profit (IE this so-called "documentary"). <br /> <br /> One claim says it can not be photographed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different lighting sources, artificial lighting from the studio. Again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same will happen in the desert of the earth at night, without the presence of light sources. But I doubt that any of the conspiracy theorists would be outside their grandmaids at all for more than the days of the Star Trek Convention. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they make all these lies to seem important - that's a fact.
