Could it be the same way you do not look at it now or the bad timing? Bad <br /> <br /> Acting, edited in a shameful way. Just compare the different scene scenes in this and similar scenes in "Do not search now" to see how much Roeg has lost. <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> So generally reliable Theresa Russell (who looks a little chunky these days, I'm afraid to report) can not save this. This plot is a purely religious pseudo-judgment, wooden representation, and attempts to promote his brand displacement with trivial time. <br /> <br /> Avoid this plague like plague.
