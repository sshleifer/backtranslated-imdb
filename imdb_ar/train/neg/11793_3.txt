Deep Shock plays as a television film: a whole group of actors of commercial quality, a poorly designed creature to be a "bad guy", a text full of technical and political expressions and more important than what to do with. <br /> <br /> I checked the film because of the creature (I like to see what the filmmakers think of their designs in these cheap videos) and came straight out of the bat, the creature on the box was not in the movie. The actors I was expecting due to the genre of the film (very general and really not thought of after a certain stage). The music was a traditional symphony, unthought. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-design. The movie flow is well done, as the guide screens let you know which group you're watching the story in, but there's not much of the story here anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 3/10 stars IMO. Search boring and destroy the mission to blow up the Arctic and these creatures protect it ... lame kinda. So lame is the love-tagged relationship between the two characters that do not see the coming. Subtract this movie as a film trying to make actors' positions away from the seat and in video. Do not care.
