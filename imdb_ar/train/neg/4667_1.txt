Visually cluttered, dump the garbage incredibly. Not even close to Greenway's best work. Avoid it at all costs! <br /> <br /> Nested "splitting" effects do not do anything more than just confuse, the film is too dark for too long, and the "technical" composition of the images is a buzzer at the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even nudity is not unbelievably strange. Watching it fill a large part of the film quickly becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> In addition, how can anyone say that the representation of Owen McGregor is wonderful outside of me. He has shown greater power in the Star Wars series, and he says something. <br /> <br /> I was not very impressed with a movie since I saw Darby Ogil and the Little People!
