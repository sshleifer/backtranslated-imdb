This film was very frustrating. <br /> <br /> The characters were very cool. Mother, which is the main character, is everything except "mother". Well, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and her children first. Her husband's death. She then goes to visit her son and meets a large piece of sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping. Even this part, the film is fine. Not excellent, but can be seen. The man is charming and who can blame her? Well, do not sleep with your daughter's lover, but let's blame the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> I became totally obsessed with the man. I think this is the part where I started to hate the film. She always wants to satisfy him "in the old way" with snacks while working at her son's house (I think this is the only thing I've ever learned), as if she were the only way she could get attention. Obviously, the man is not very interested (in fact, it seems he was like sleeping with him charitable activity) and instead of insulting him, continue to interrogate him to go to bed with her and cute. When it becomes very offensive. "I want to please you," I told him in a desperate way while he was very insulting. <br /> <br /> What angered me in this film is the total lack of self-respect for the mother. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless mass" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to a kind woman. If so, I would have bought myself something small that would bring me the same complacency and less emotional pain ... :)
