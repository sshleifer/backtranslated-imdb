... Not that all Disney movies are waste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and I loved the movie completely. When I heard that she had 2 sequel, I was ecstasy. I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. I do not see how they can make a sequel to G-horror film. The original is a film / documentary about Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Back" is for children and should not be seen by anyone. I do not remember the plot very well. It's been a long time since I saw it and I will not see it again, but ... it's about fishermen coming to town and going to kill Bigfoot. Three young children sneak out of the house to prevent them. Great monsoon comes through. Catch fishermen, are saved by children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large cloth on top and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly, Bigfoot comes up and does something really sick. I do not want to spoil the end for any Yas, but it's not scary. Okay....
