Bill (Friends Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid three women Jackie (Catherine Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Den) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and make sure he did not fall from two gold mines. One of them, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), is on the scene to frustrate women. We follow the story where more money is offered to girls to appear in a show rather than the role of accompaniment they agreed to implement for three months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Belle and the other ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. There are musical numbers in the story but the songs are bad and Catherine Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not too good. It's fun enough but comes to life only when playing drums or trombone. There is a very disturbing character playing the role of taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is boring.
