Recently, I was obsessed with this film and I expect so much that I had to see it. Well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating has become quite understandable. I think if you expect something to the extent that it becomes an urgent need, it turns out that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Certainly, The Hills Have Eyes moments. It has a great and well developed story that is well connected to the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so immersed in itself that it is difficult to follow. If it was not Wes Craven's production, it would have nothing to do with the original version. <br /> <br /> But it all makes you go "Is this supposed to be a horror or a comedy?" Because there are a lot of ridiculous and randomized jumping moments and one stupid linings (IE "There's a hand in sh ** er!" Or "You motherfu ** eh! I'll kill you all the sons of the curse b ** tches!") And acting (God does not even remember me It was bad. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (This part contains spoilers, watch out!) The film begins with a woman giving birth to a mutated child (ooh la la!), Then the screen fades to black with the title of the movie and monologue, then We go to this office, where there are veteran war models in a random location, people looking for mutants, the fund tracking the audio profiles has ended, and everyone dies! More. <br /> <br /> Then, we go to this one-team training of military recruits in Baghdad, and while the captain was offering them a "good job in stupidity", it was the last day of training in New Mexico, the desert where the family stayed at THHE During the training, things get worse in the end, people die ... and do I need to tell you anymore, because right now I have an interest in a goldfish that just forced me to sit here and write this. <br /> <br /> The wrong thing about THHE2 is that it does not work. No past memories, the end is very safe ... but with a twist! One stupid, that is. I'm sure Ultra Super Director's Cut with a 3D cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all of its alternate ends, but at this point, I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> By all means, if you love the first thing, it is almost a sin not to see it, then by all means, see it. But if so, then, avoid at all costs. It is for your personal benefit. <br /> <br /> 3/10
