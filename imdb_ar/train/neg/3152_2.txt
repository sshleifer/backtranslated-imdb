Poorly organized, poorly written, full of cliches and flat dialogue. Not one scene shines. Actors struggle with a painful, boring scenario that can avoid any surprises, distortions, or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes where you will go. <br /> <br /> For the film being shown in New York, it hardly feels the city. There are over a dozen independent movies that make it look magic with a small budget.

It felt like I was watching a low-level Christian film during the week, which was immoral and moral. <br /> <br /> The great success of Steven Vedder is that he convinced people to make this thin film.
