Among the three titles of Jess Franco to find their way to the official video list of the DPP Division (Deville Hunter, the Bloody Moon and the Woman Behind the Bars), this may be the least deserving of bad reputation, being a dull missed hideout reviving a little incompetent gore, an unjustified rape scene , And a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> Brilliant blonde Ursula Butchvillner plays the role of star Laura Crawford, kidnapped by a gang of brutal kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe worshiping the "god of Satan" stalking the jungle. Eat the hearts of female sacrifices). <br /> <br /> Used by Laura's agent to deliver a ransom of $ 6 million, the brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Clever) and his Vietnam vet travel to the island, but they face some problems when the bad guys try to cross a double ball. During the chaos, Laura escapes to the forest, but she goes directly into the embrace of the inhabitants of the island, who show her to their God. <br /> <br /> Franco is guided by his moderate style and carries this funny effort with his usual horrifying brands: a crow of nonsense, mysterious cinematography, fast zoom, lots of crotch shots, out-of-focus photos, awful sound effects, and pork release. The result is a terrible mess that represents a real struggle to sit from the beginning to the end (it took me some sessions to finish the thing), and even the enchanting scene of Bochfelner in all its natural glory is not enough to make me review this film in a hurry.
