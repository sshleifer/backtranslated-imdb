Can I give this a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most brutal film I've ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boring Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of mystery. We hired this movie with a friend, and after about thirty minutes of hope to get better, we decided to "progress quickly" a bit to see if things would get better. Never improve. This film about some of the dude who was kidnapped by these two girls seems interesting, but it is really just a cavity. Nothing remotely interesting happens at all. If you have a chance to see this, do your favor, try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE" instead.
