"The Incubus" is a combination of good (an interesting murder mystery), bad (an offline script, dirty decision, bad-looking offensive scenes) and strange (intense incantations, a dark and mysterious performance by John Cassavet - To be "wacko"?). It is hardly as offensive as it is known, but it is not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
