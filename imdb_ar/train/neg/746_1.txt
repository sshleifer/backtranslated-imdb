Save $ 8.97 that you'll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go to watch the real movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker, but I am a fan of HG Wells. I had to buy this in the hope of sitting and watching three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I could not stand more than 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Heinz had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the heck went? Have you used most of them to buy a new home? Funding his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is actually good about this film. They are still loyal to the book and there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors who clearly tried to make this film good. But the good performance has overwhelmed him terribly fast ... I mean the terrible special effects. Any student in the student film school can do a much better job with CGI. For me, most of them looked like "Action action" breakouts, instead of the sophisticated CGI program that a $ 20 million project should use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for post-amateur production that was applied to this film. My partner and I sat and prepared our Ferry scene with a program that cost less than $ 1,500.00 and within five minutes of the scene looked better and more realistic than Hines had created. I've seen films with budgets of less than $ 2 million looking better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than the special influences of Heinz in this film. In fact, I have much better appreciation for Tomato's killer attack because of this film. There is no excuse for the current technology of a film that looks like a B-50 film, unless that is intent, which is not what it should have been with this particular project. <br /> <br /> A problem I faced with a DVD transfer was a jerky movie, another amateur film show. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that has a better film and special effects from this film. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who makes a good film or a WOTW fan to leave this movie on the shelf and watch the 50 foot foot attack instead. It will be easier on the eyes.
