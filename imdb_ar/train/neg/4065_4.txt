... through the exotic like-minded Eric Stanzi. A particularly incompetent director has led a poor film, but I still find myself sitting in front of the closing credits, if there is nothing but seeing what happens next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls the old flames. After her arrest (although she came willingly) and her threat of sex (another event she was also willing to do) reveals that he had kidnapped three men who had abused her in the past. Then decides to kill her (huh?) But is frustrated and dies instead. The girl's mind settles (or something like that) and angers her anger from the lucky chapters downstairs. <br /> <br /> Well, suck writing: it's long, filled with words of a dime and there is way too much. <br /> <br /> Sucking representation: What accurate, what representation? <br /> <br /> The image sucks: The home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery footage is just an insult to the curse. <br /> <br /> Budget prank: Get it ... "Budget", that was the basis. <br /> <br /> However, there was magic to this thing. Back in the seventies, this type of film appeared in theaters with real budgets and talent associated with it, not in this day and age. If you want to watch this kind of violent garbage and sexual exploitation (do not lie, some of us do) then this is all you will get these days. <br /> <br /> Some hardcore shots are short in the sex scene, among the best on the list, torture using fecal material, fun with the hubs, anal rape with a broomstick, and long shots of the crazy chick who masturbates with the same broomstick. <br /> <br /> It will not be remembered, but not since the peak of Joe D'amato where people made films like this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
