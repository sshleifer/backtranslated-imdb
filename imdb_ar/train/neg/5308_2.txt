Nothing can prepare you for another lousy Pembo stroll! This time, you are brought to you by Fred Olin Ray's inevitable! As far as the movies go exploit, this click does not click! As science fiction, it is easy to original! All we see is an ugly female Android wearing a bikini to destroy the earth, and shows almost everything naked to resist! Give me a --- Jie broke! If this kind of entertainment is the thing you prefer, why not get rid of those old swimsuits of SI from the attic for change?! This could have been much better if you did not put a corrupt agent on a very high level, but that would not make it great. I would like to make another film called The Assault (1996) by Jim Weinorsky, similar to the ALIENATOR. This explains why the first femme fatale films do not translate from person to person in America. Sorry boys!
