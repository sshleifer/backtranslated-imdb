***** Maybe the minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say I liked it, but I can not say I did ... very strange. It has bad things in it, for example a shark that went out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if you were the director and I would definitely cut this part, gave me the desire to stop seeing the rest of the movie. For some people, it will be boring because it lacks work, and feels that it was made at home sometimes ... Take a scene where a friend died, and the next thing they do is what? No, do not cry ... tell horror stories to each other .. * sigh * (just after crying over the lost hes) <br /> <br /> There was something else stupid when they were talking inside the boat they loved hundreds of " On the table in front of them ... The boat is surrounded by a kind of rag curtains (the old rags that cover the windows) and sofas / couches ... I think they were stupid, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being on the high seas alone ... <br /> <br /> Well, some scary scenes that they did well I liked some Sometimes horror is better when it is hidden when behind it something But it works fine for me! You will feel nervous if you forget some holes like the ones you mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much But if you like any of the movies watching this movie, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my rough English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
