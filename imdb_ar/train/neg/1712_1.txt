If Todd Sheets should come out and admit that this film was meant to parody the zombie genre, I would like to change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a film in which every scene, line and even each representation was designed to be a simple parody. Maybe I could get rid of the alphabet soup and rearrange the remaining letters, and I still have better text. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think about this film. Alarm spoiler! One of them is when Mike's father and other parents walk. I repeat the walk in the staircase jam filled with zombies. This is a small drawer, and although they collide with a leakage disc, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former soldier turns "God you are to the bastard of the horn", and shoots only one. And the other in the military complex. The zombie girl stabbed a machete and surrounded her instantly. The camera moves around for about forty seconds, while the zombie surrounds her arm. Then run out of the crowd and join other humans. The spoiler alarm on! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I enjoy this movie like almost any comedy just because it's very funny. Glory to Todd Shakes to get a lot of people into his film and have the motivation to do it but not really to anything else.
