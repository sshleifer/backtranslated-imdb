I want to say that acting is bad, but I think it was the guidance that made it as well. I never thought of Highlander (the same director) but that person could be blamed in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> However, there is no excuse for it. People get shot as they emerge from trenches with a man in front of him !? This type of error, coupled with an unclear timetable, strange battle tactics, substandard parts, and bad visual effects, make this film a substandard movie. <br /> <br /> Commented, all this is American nonsense. The German general is practically afraid of his own American family. Be prepared to ingest many of them, despite small doses. <br /> <br /> To summarize, it is not a terrible film but it is still uncertain in all respects.
