"The triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It's nonsense, enormous, 4 hours of torture. In fact, it takes just under two hours and seems much longer. It hurts me to even think of amateur shows for great actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not too bad. Maybe they were trying to be above the top, to be clowns, but if so, I did not see it. Mira Sorvino does not leave an impression in one way or another. She (he) is just there. I think the play of the same name, written by Marifu 270 years ago or so, is much better. Can not be worse. Claire Pablo, the writer and director of this film, was inspired by a modern production of the play. I do not know what she was thinking when she made this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all in translation.
