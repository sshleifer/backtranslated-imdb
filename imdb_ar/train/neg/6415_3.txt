This was far from the worst film I have ever seen. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gilard was translated into her old book of empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her character and no one else could see it. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that hatred was "somewhat", do not go to see this unless you get the pleasure of wasting your life time and your life. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie free of charge by the way so I do not want this to appear like the story of a man who lost $ 8 in a terrible film. He was free, still absorbed, I hated him. <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
