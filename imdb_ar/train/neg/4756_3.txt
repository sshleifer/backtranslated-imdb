A new version of the wonderful 1972 film, where he was chosen as an enemy of his character in the first film. But do nothing good at all. <br /> <br /> A poor performance by actors, Law and Caine, has been further diluted by the weakness of the self-indulgent trend. <br /> <br /> The warmth of the setting was originally abandoned for ultra-modern housekeeping. The hidden interaction between Olivier and Ken, who made the first film fickle, is replaced with an awful awful arrogance that instantly leads to contempt for the viewer. But this is not the smart intelligence that you like and then the other character that the original well cared for, it's a clear assassination of the OTT character for both letters of the word go. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not worth watching, watching the original movie and dazzling from the opening event.
