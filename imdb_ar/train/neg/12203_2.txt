I think it's time to continue John Rambo's life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series became old and Rambo was no longer a soldier, but a murderer with blood. Any time he gets on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place and frankly, I was tired of Hollywood and made it look like it was. This is not the worst film related to Vietnam, and this honor goes to John Wayne Green Peretz. However, John Rambo carries about 50 calories from a machine gun that takes what appears to be half the Viet Cong's army and a large number of Russians is an insult to watch. What's worse than cheesy Rambus speech in the end ... please! Oh yeah I heard they make one another ...
