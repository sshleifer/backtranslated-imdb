What can I say about Seven Pounds ... I've seen a good trip from Seattle to Tokyo since that trip was long and the film was not confirmed. The character of Will Smith, Ben Thomas, is almost undesirable, even in the end. The runtime of the two-hour movie plus the run-time most of the time in the screen is wasted with random garbage that threads the plot as slow as possible. In the defense films, Rosario Dawson adds little to life to the film, though not much. I do not understand how anyone can actually cry during this movie when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also Will Smith kills himself with jellyfish in the end to prove that killing yourself with jellyfish is the dumbest way to die.
