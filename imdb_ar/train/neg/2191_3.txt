The doctor who attempts to complete the medical dream of the transplant is secretly experimenting with the bodies of the hospital with varying success. His best last chance comes when he wraps his girlfriend's head gently in his jacket as he saves her from a burning car. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this hypothesis I thought I found it. It contains everything that bad hunters look for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs and unique camera angles (I always love watching the rear-wheeled passenger cars), curly clarinet music, and one of the longest death scenes in the film's history. Unfortunately, these bad bad moments could not overcome the very bad stinking. <br /> <br /> Jean in the frying pan, with her vulgar approaches in a husky whisper, somewhat annoyed me, less than the wicked laugh, and the fact that she survived with some alcoholic drinks at home in Colombia and 2 DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I could not even think of myself with Dr. Bill's extraordinarily terrible and moral self-righteousness. . Usually such pork make these films a must in my opinion, in which case I felt bored of it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film in my opinion was the 1960 version of "Physical Shopping" and I even found myself nodding during it. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on this movie - there are bad movies better to entertain your humor.
