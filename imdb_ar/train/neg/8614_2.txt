I must admit immediately that I was not a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, me does not get "no respect". I saw this just because my wife wanted to see it, and I found exactly what I was expecting: a stupid story without any real teaser. It's full of labyrinths and rude jokes and a silly plot about a Dangerfield developer planning to build a ski resort in Utah that has not caught my attention at all. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, the film has starred in poor actors, including the likes of Andrew Des Clay and the entire John Bainer hill (I did not know it was still there until I saw his name in credits for this purpose). Disaster is really Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
