I must say that during my childhood I am very proud of the many films I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the quorum movie every time in your resume for any actor. Can you just imagine what the Whoopie agent should have told her up this piece of scandals "Hey Whoop, I've seen before that the dinosaurs appear, yes they've made a movie of it and you can see Germany!" Then, this must be The worker has referred to Star Wars a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, I figured that Whoopie had bought every copy of this movie and destroyed it. I wish I had done the same thing in my memory, because my sister still gives me the crap to watch that movie. I mean, hey, I'll admit that I even saw Mr. Nani and Kazam in the theaters (good reasons to give up both Hulk Hogan and hard for a while), yet it remains in my childhood imagination and the biggest regret of my life, 16 years ago. I am now 24 years old if you want to do math. <br /> <br /> When I think of the worst movies ever, I do not remember this film, because I'm like a raped child, I'm trying hard to suppress it ever happened. Speak to me, Woebe, be happy that people only recognize Eddie and Sester 2 as the worst in luck.
