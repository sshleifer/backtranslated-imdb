I felt I had to watch this movie all the time, because I found him in a bargaining box and bought it for my country, but I came very close to stopping it and just writing off the money you paid for it. If you love Gore and Sadia, this movie is fine. If there is one thing that filmmakers know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a satisfactory effect. If that does not work, go away. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed on a home video camera, using the props of primary school and terrible actors. It is dubbed from German, but even allowing it, the sound is great. This movie is about budget as it gets budget, except for the special effects listed above. If they spent a little more money on actors and real text instead of blood and courage, maybe the film was a bit more fun. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three men who arrived on an island inhabited by an army of masked sadists. They are caught, and the rest of the film revolves around their attempt to escape. I call this story in the broader sense, because it is really a series of scenes of torture and fighting interlocking together through a dialogue full of obscenity. <br /> <br /> There is nothing at all retrieving this movie, unless you are like a reckless gore. Consider yourself cautious.
