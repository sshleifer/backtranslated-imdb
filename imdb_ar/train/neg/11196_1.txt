My friends and I went out after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. After that, we tried to recoup our money. The film department did not allow this, but they agreed to let us see another film. The only time I worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: the former child star. As you can say, this was not an unforgettable night. Probably one of the worst movie nights. The second closure must be when I saw a double head of household disorders and theft. In conclusion, for humanity, please do not see the order.
