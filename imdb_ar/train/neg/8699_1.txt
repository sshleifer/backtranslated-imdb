Carnosur 3 is bad ... very bad. So bad that it's funny. How much I want to try to convince myself, I can not believe anyone in this world can find this amusing for serious reasons. I mean come on, even the cover is bad! Well, the special effects are very silly. Those "Carnosaurs" are really silly. One scientist tells the soldiers that they are moving at an unbelievable speed, but when you see them run, they run quickly ... A representative in a rubber suit tries to run as far as he can. Funny explosions (no other word to describe). At first, a jeep hit a jeep after a man said, "What was that?" ... and other explosions are also laughable. But the worst thing is the script and the alleged story. Do not expect a good story (or do not think anyone who rent this movie expects a good film) but at least the story should try to be logical. I mean, how difficult it is to make up a story about dinosaurs that kill people at least coherently. It is very difficult if you look at this. Oh, and if you think it's easy to make your characters credible, tell him the book of this horrible piece. I mean, any sick person who would make cheap jokes after the death of one of his companions? They do a lot of it. And if you think that a film about dinosaurs kills soldiers can only be packed with traffic, wake up !!! This film is incredibly boring. The Carnosur attack (which invented this lame name anyway?) (In a tedious sequence of work where not much is happening). Soldiers think about how to overcome them (in incredibly funny scenes where they try hard to be serious but can not convince even one second). So, they attack the synosor, but their idea does not work (another laughable sequence of action). Back to the layout (with some lame jokes thrown) in another ridiculous scene. This continues, and on, and on. And let's not forget the acting that is as convincing as the special effects ... and the story ... Oh well, this film is simply absorbed from the ground up. <br /> <br />
