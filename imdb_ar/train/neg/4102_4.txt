"Dead Letter Office" is a low-budget film about two Australian postal service employees, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the representation is weak and the links between the calamities of past figures and the present mentality are clumsy and over-represented. But the most depressing thing is that the picture is life in the office of the title of the film: There is no mechanism at all, and it is absolutely impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do to live. Admittedly, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office was certainly closed in the 1930s, if it exists. It is shameful, because the overall tone of the film is moving and exciting, and there is some hope in the scenario: but few details convince. In general, he feels the work of someone who has not experienced much of real life; student film, with a concept and layout, but unfortunately little else.
