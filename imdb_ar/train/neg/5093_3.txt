I visited the Russian forum of our TV channel that screened this film. Well ... 99% of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more real facts of our space achievements in this film. But the authors had something else :( We are a great and beautiful country with intelligent people living here, we are proud of all our dreams of space, and real achievements on the one hand in this area and in the sciences on the other, so I would like to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, our Hell station MIR? Ah? I'm sure the LUNOHOD events occurred much earlier in the "Moonwalk" Armstrong .Indications - I really do not have enough space and time here, let us attack our constructive critics in the Russian forum on www 1.tv.ru
