Despite the great touches of futuristic design, Asimov's smart premise, and the impressive performance that is reliable for Will Smith, this film does not live up to expectations. Cliches come thick and fast. (When waking up from a recurring nightmare, a dissident cop cancels his motto by the hard lieutenant, to insert more things that will spoil them - you can see the end a mile away). This movie is also on stage - you will never feel you have traveled anywhere; what is supposed to be a global disaster does not leave CGI Chicago clearly. The robots themselves are good at the closeup, but the "crowd" scenes look more like a bad Disney - I've gone over CGI over and over again. If you can destroy robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject "nanites"? You know it's a tough movie when stupid questions like that begin to bother you before the peak. It could have been wonderful, but it was less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the perfectly predictable plot which could have come from any motion film over the last forty years.
