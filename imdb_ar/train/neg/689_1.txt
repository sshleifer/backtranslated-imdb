What is that? This must be the biggest waste of movies, settings and the camera at all. I know you can not adjust your expectations for the high 1980s, but this is so stupid that it can not be true. I studied this film for $ 0.89 and still feel the need to claim my money back. Can you imagine who is so difficult? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are his motivations ??? Well in fact, you can not care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage were certainly not interested. They did not try to create a little tension. The director (Steven Carpenter - I think it is much easier to find money in such a name) also made Kindred (1986) that was somewhat enjoyable and recently performed by Soul Survors. Full crap as well, but at least that one was Eliza Dushko. This junk debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes that's right, chick place Melrose. The death of her memorable character is about 15 minutes. After opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to remember or miss him afterwards. Who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the term actors in fact, are completely uninterested. I was hoping to die quickly and painfully ... not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
