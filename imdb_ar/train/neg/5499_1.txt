I saw this bomb when it hit the theater. I laughed all the time. why? Because it seemed stupid to me that he made me go mad. I go back and realize that there was nothing funny about the whole movie. In something deliberate nothing. It is a terrible laugh that Lizzie cn chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a huge satanic carnivore ... yet, her tiny clothes with a look are completely intact, although it is now hundreds of times bigger than it was when she first put it on. Or the kind of movies in which a man is shocked by a remover of failure and does not fall only consciousness, and returns to consciousness without any medical attention. And do not let me start with the funny fate of the "villain" they decided they needed to create a "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For someone who complains about Disney that targets only children - it seems that the terrible parts of this film refute this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having strange videos? You can do this if you are out of Disney and you are out of ideas to make the movie amuse crowds over 8 without writing a smarter script! I'm absolutely convinced that Disney is pushing the ratings panel, so movies can get away with killing and keep getting family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of DVD format.
