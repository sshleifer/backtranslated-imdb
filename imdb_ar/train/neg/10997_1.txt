First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why in the world are trying to sell a piece of low budgets on late-night television with a promise of disturbing and offensive scum that no real human being has the spirit to see. <br /> <br /> What is the ridiculous folly about a dog being injured, and the grandmother stops her head ... A man blows his hand into two pieces Two girls go to the bathroom? What reached this hell is that people find comedy in something quite sick. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even let him walk on earth. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear not even the offensive ... so ... they prepare comedy through piles of sick trash ... they can not even pull it out.
