This film starts with a certain amount of promise. But, in my opinion, he begins to lose when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to help him when his car crashes. The fact that this oddity of good intentions begins to repair his car while he is in a phone call is not reasonable enough, but it is one of the few people in the country who can help him get his family back on track. Coincidentally the book warned against the use of their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on average at best. Art direction could have been much better, as it could have been cinematography. He was well represented and also sang Eva van der Gott.
