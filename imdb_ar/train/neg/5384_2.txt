All the noise! What is the best way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can not release their movie through a major distributor? So, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the noise from the film does not justify the content in the film. The story is absent and can easily be short. The acting is weak, but the animation and music are good. Otherwise do not waste your time - Incredible hype! However, if you have a chance to watch the movie for free, do so. Then you will not have to waste money. However, filmmakers are doing a good job of putting pressure on their story and creating cliffhangers makers with a mini-series indulged in themselves. Otherwise, understand the wonders of one never before seen.
