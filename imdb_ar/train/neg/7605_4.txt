I think Gunslinger was not as enjoyable as most of the films in Mystery Science Theater 3000, but Westerners are not just Roger Korman. Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) depicts a mayor in an old town in the Old West after her husband's husband was killed and forced to fight bad guys, and the film is largely predictable. John Ireland is the new Baal Rose, and works secretly for Allison Hayes, a strenuous (yes, woman of 50 feet long). He also briefly features frequent co-star in Corman Dick Miller as a postman (Miller currently stars in Joe Dante's films). <br /> <br /> I would like to emphasize that you may want to watch the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with her.
