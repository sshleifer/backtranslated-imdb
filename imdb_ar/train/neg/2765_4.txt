How this film was made with a budget of $ 70 million and without fully reproducing it goes beyond me. The story and the dialogue are beyond the amateur. Characters say things that no real person can say and rarely react to things that have been said before. There does not seem to be anyone based on the real world. The representation of potential customers is good given that writing is such a failure ... but many actors in supporting roles are already leading to lower production. Maybe the hero's hair was supposed to have earned his own balance, he was very fun ... not to mention he made one of the best presentations in the PIC. Finally, for a film about L.A. Surrounded by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. what a shame! If you see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking of ways you can capture SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it will not take much.
