When I read the back of the DVD tray, I thought it was really interesting ... so ... I pushed my mom to pile the movies in the "4 for $ 20" section of the Blockbuster. When we got home and broke into the film ... Twenty minutes later, we found ourselves moving to each other "this sucks ... let's put something else". I will admit that some of the lines of friends at the cafe made us smile a bit. But come on, at least get some respectable representatives! Every now and then in the film, if the acting is bad and the film is not slow paced and painful and really looks interesting, I can get rid of it and just have some laugh about how it ends (or below)) do their lines. But I can only handle a lot. The scenes of tears seemed as if the actors were suffering hysterical bouts of laughter, and there was no delivery to their lines ... Amateurs do not even come close to acting in this film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here said this movie was good and some really good drugs had to be taken while watching the movie. It's the most useless thing I've ever had. Do not see or buy this movie !!
