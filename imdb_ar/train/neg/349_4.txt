Boiler pot if you see one. A supposed thriller called "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", or even "In the Heat of the Night" with a small reverse murder, "Strangers in a Train" was cast, and failed. Where all of the above, to a large extent, succeeded. They provide excitement. It seems that the plot is intense from a larger book, making the plot development clear and uninvolved, while the trend lacks pace and confusion. To curb any glory, it had to be greatly distorted along the way, and here also failed clearly. Conrey is clearly slowing down in his old age, hardly bothering his attempt with an American accent, and it seems to be largely a pair of hope for Lang's father and his sons hostage. He even has a father in law who seems smaller than him. Lawrence Fishburne barely gets the chance to live in his role and is confused at the start whether he is a bad man or a good young man. One of them once said that memories of the past should not lie - they do so, confusedly, here. The rest of the play is just average through the cast in their reasonable stereotyped roles. The assumed peak also managed to roll by leaving me firmly firmly in the back, not as it should have been the target, the front edge of the seat. The average Hollywood movie is definitely filthy.
