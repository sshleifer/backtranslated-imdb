Before watching this movie I had very low expectations and went to see the cars. In the end I even regret to go for this reason. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Personal development does not exist. There were lots of clich√©s and lots of cheese falling in my jaw so I could not stare but wonder how it was released. If this is not the case for alien aliens, I would not even be able to classify this film as an attempt to destroy a coherent story line is destroyed because of the utter absurdity of culting the elite race and the ridiculous characters that make up its members. In fact, the film plot is predictable and so simple that the average child can predict most of the story's story. Bad behavior, bad plot, bad jokes, bad film. <br /> <br /> You do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and satisfy your thirst for exciting high-speed cars without leaving a bad taste.
