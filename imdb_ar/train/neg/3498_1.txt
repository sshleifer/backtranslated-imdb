I just watched one episode of this program and could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I have watched this program, I have to drop about 10 points. This is basically a program like for kids but with the right. Not even the curses and insults she tells other people made me laugh. In any case, the story must be written by a monkey and the people who have already developed this script for this program for photography should be at gunpoint and have no choice but to photograph this lamentable, hideous and terrible program. Sarah Silverman should use the little money she has already made from this program and get some lessons representing the curse of God.
