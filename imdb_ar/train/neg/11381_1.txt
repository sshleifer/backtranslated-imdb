Now, I like science fiction comics. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and felt very dismayed. Public figures and stereotypes (do they really need to make an African-American man dressed in tiger-striped clothes and speak in a monotone? Why are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow? Does the mother have big thighs? The chest is constantly complaining?) So things become unrealistic, Predictable, gross and sometimes annoying. There are very similarities in the Astro Boy, even in stitches. Allow me to explain (young names): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, "My Life As A Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtelles", "Kamen Riders" and "Sailor Moon" and co. Are in full swing. Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotypes. So do not make me start with hints. I will only say they are hidden and very dirty. But seriously. Do not even try watching this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
