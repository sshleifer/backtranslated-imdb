I am an 11th grader at my high school. In my "Current World Affairs" chapter, there was a child in my chapter of this video and suggested we watch it. So we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon, since my father works for NASA. Although I think this film is the biggest part of the waste I have ever seen, the man who created it has some serious balls. First of all, does he have to show that John Kennedy gets a shot? And how dare to use all those biblical quotations. The only good thing about this film is that it provokes controversy, which is good for me in my class, we have weekly discussions. This film did nothing to change my mind. I think with Michael Moore they should work together and make another film. Michael Moore can be called the next film "Funny thing happened on September 11" or "Something funny happened on the way to the White House."
