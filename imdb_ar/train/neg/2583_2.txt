The other American pie movie has been pushed down our throats, and this is the worst one of them all. Not worth the name of American Pie. They had to stop at The Wedding. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a stupid pornographic film where they put the American Pie on. When I was watching this I felt like I was watching a different series. Do not fall like an American pancake at all. His teaser is different and is more rude and contains many sexual scenes then other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it at all. In fact I do not recommend any of the films "American Pie Presents". Just stick with a nice original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
