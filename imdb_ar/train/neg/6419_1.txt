Think of the end of Grudge 2 as follows: <br /> <br /> - A man who repeatedly says "Sunshine" - Cowboys - Love story - Sarah Michelle Gillard cut herself - a creepy mirror> <br /> OH and Underwater Water SEA ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie ... I did not really enjoy it at all. The film poster is too misleading and I found it was just sucking people to see it ... I can not believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go and watch the third saw ... a movie that makes you feel that it has been an effort ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and Emma
