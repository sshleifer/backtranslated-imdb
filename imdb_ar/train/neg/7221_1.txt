.... The reason for this! This kind of film makes you want to go to a movie maker's slap and say "Why?". The terrible camera works ... Calculate the times when the camera tries to stay fixed on one person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. Acting is a comedy. They seem to have seized a ghost town in the West to see if they can produce a film with as little money as possible. I used to bet for $ 10 to use home video cameras to do that. Either this, or most of the photographers were drunk. Truly the funniest trailers of the film. If you ever want to host a "Worst Film Concert", bring this. You want more entertainment ... staring at the wall.
