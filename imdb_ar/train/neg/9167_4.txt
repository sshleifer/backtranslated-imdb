"Leap Years" is a film taken from an electronic novel by Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, which became Singapore's first online novel / novel. The film had a post-production zigzag agenda: it was shot in early 2005 and was scheduled for release at the end of 2005, but it was only released three years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year. Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a romantic type lover, so I may be a little biased to this film - I've just seen it was a production from Singapore and it's available to borrow in my neighborhood library . Here are two years in the film. <br /> <br /> Let's just start by saying that unlike KS, Qi Yu-wu's Kong and Wong Li-Lin, everyone here seems to be European. Attention to love is Eurasian (Ananda Everningham), and three of Weng's comrades are all Europeans. Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love with the Eurasians is "more" than ordinary Chinese (or whatever Asian race are you?) I do not know, it certainly looks that way. Also, everyone in the film speaks in a "pure" mystical tone that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's a kind of "semi-perfect English" that authorities want to talk about, but that's not anywhere in the world, for example, MTV. The result is that the film's dialog box seems troubled and strained, not helped by the lack of true Singaporeans in the film. <br /> <br /> It seems that the screenwriter is trying hard to link a series of individual fonts after one hardcore. Twenty minutes later, the film "Novelty" begins to fade and the film begins to present a plate of the usual cliches. <br /> <br /> I think I did not enjoy the film because the whole premise of maintaining an affair for 16 years seems unreasonable. <br /> <br /> There are other questions in the film. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-woo) will fall for one of Wang's girlfriends. The scene where the groom says, "Go, before I change my mind", was used in one hundred East Asian TV series (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc ...) <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie . The production value is fair, and Wong Li-lin is trying its best, but not helped by the script. Jean Chen plays part of the movie "Wong older" for 15 minutes, probably the best actress in the film, but hey, her role is just a veil. <br /> <br /> If you encounter "Leap years" in a rental or library, you may want to broadcast them in a DVD player for curiosity, but otherwise, for people who do not quite enjoy this kind of romance, you can decide what If you get a miss or not. .
