Liongate has not yet established itself. Every film from the film Lionsgate was deplorable. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they kept slapping me again and again. Certainly Cever Fever is no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this film which was very frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. The man cuts the dead dog for some reason. He gets infected with a random virus and takes him to children in a camp. The children start to die and the town finds out. Instead of helping them, they kill them. Then the water is infected and everyone dies. End. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the entire movie. <br /> <br /> All characters are completely backward, do not care about any of them, and the only child must be stuck with the boy meets the world. My friend and I have found that talking about how fat and time our classmate is more enjoyable than taking care of this film. We've managed to reach the end with the bulls screaming $ @ t, because this film will make you do it. <br /> <br /> I'm still confused by the random random karate movements of one random child and how everyone in the country seems to be completely backward and structurally. Again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why was the child who was trying to kill Hex sitting on a chair waiting for him to kill him? Was that part of their plan? Wonderful. Best plan ever. I can not believe that this film got a theatrical version. I could barely make a DVD, let alone sit in a theater that does not move for an hour and a half. It was not scary, funny, wonderful or anything. It's just a 90 minute waste that you can use for ... I do not know, planting a tree or something. It's more productive than this piece of garbage. Representation, special effects, and text are a joke. Do not pick this up at all. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever has one haircut, out of 10
