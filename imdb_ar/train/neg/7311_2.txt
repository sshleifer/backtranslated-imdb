Well, I have only heard a little about this film, so when I show on movie channels on TV, I wanted to watch it, I was a horror lover. I think I can do collective "huh?" For everyone who saw it. <br /> <br /> I decided to go ahead with my life, but at a party with my close friends, we saw that it had happened, and some of us had already decided that we could laugh our way through it, both of us declaring "this is the dumbest thing I have ever seen Absolutely". It was not scary. I give it to Ruth (which I think is a small breakthrough); characters change throughout the film, "Cube". <br /> <br /> However, despite the scenario "mice in the cage" your model - who will manage from, etc., was an average horror. <br /> <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with this child? I'm not talking about him being strange and biting people. I'm talking about "slow kicking of karate", what's this? 2.) Well, I know that Ryder's personality was like Jordan Ladez, but as a girl, I was terrified because he just went ahead and harassed her in her sleep. Ah, this is illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just so Ruth was in the movie. Talk about writing yourself meaningless! 4.) What was with the MP? 5.) So it was immediately pulled by the dog? There is little blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway we laugh at our donkeys, I like to laugh during horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Dead Evil), but I do not know if I was supposed to laugh here ...
