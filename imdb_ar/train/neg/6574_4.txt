(Avast, minor spoilers in front of me) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> Once I went to the town of Matuan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there I saw the schedule of Citra Theater City in May 1954. The movies will change in the theater every day. Since there would be no TV for another decade or so in those parts, this was a large part of the entertainment available in the city. The "raid" seems to have been made for cities like Matwan in the 1950s. Although it was not included for this month, I'm sure I was offered on Monday or Tuesday night to an audience that probably was not much. The historic raid - bold and successful - does not seem to have been well studied, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. St. Albans seemed to have more Yankee soldiers coming and going to the city than Washington had. <br /> <br /> What made me Snicker was a fact when the divers changed their official Confederacy uniforms. Only in vulgar civil war paintings does the fashion of the revolutionaries seem very creative. When Anne Anne Bancroft caught Van Hevelin in his uniform before the raid, she expected the boy to believe it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> Then there's Ann Bancroft. While watching the movie, IMDb is already looking to see if there is Anne Bancroft. The studio-like actress does not resemble the studio in her later films, and has no subsequent presence in The Miracle Worker, Agnes of God, and of course The Graduate. <br /> It's worth seeing if it's only 1). You live in St Albans and 2). You have a few hours to imagine Hollywood's imagination for the biggest news story in your town.
