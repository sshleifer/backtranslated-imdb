Angela grew up and got the treatment and the process of turning her into a real daughter of life, instead of the son she was born in. She now has a job - waiting for that - as a counselor in the camp! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. In any case, the first part of the Camp Sleepaway privilege obeys all the rules of the consequences of horror - more blood, more creative killing (which is not imaginary, but still more original), more nudity, more detailed plot, generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's as entertaining as the original version, as the characters and wardrobes are the most elegant and 80-year-old, so you can not help getting a good laugh. At some point, a man asks Angela, says "I'll call you," and then walks away. The man says to himself, "How will you call me? I do not have a phone!" Then he inhales the candles of his armpit, and wonders what is extinguished (it is hair, dude !!). <br /> <br /> It is a known fact that adolescents killed in the 1980s were more than not punished by their killer because of some kind of bad behavior, being highly irregular. When I started getting into horror movies for the first time and watched Friday's 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s, I did not realize this. I learned this in a film class after a year or two, and I was amazed that this was a way of being mad. I was very touched, not only because the films were conveying a message, albeit a satisfactory one, but there were already some ideas in it. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, "Let this be a lesson for you. Say no to drugs!" Write real screen hidden there, men. Then again, the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the film. Angela (who, incidentally, went through all this treatment and those processes and all those problems to clean her past and reinvent herself as a natural and evolving person and then changed her name from Angela to, mother, Angela), says at some point, "I do not like being the evil witch in the West , But I know what happens when things get out of hand. " (People start killing ... HA!) <br /> <br /> Then, one of the counselors, Mary, asks for an apology, and the girl answers, "The best death!" Sorry, Mary, but you entered it ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp counselor in a camp-style campground filmed in this film (except for the camp I taught in Cannes had more than three children To 15 or 20 advisers, as he had rules, which no one did in the film). This made me notice the countless contradictions in the film of what it really resembled camp life. <br /> <br /> It's okay, though, you can hardly make a movie like that with many children at 9 years running in the neighborhood, although about 10 or 11 years have died in this movie. I have never seen this kind of thing before. <br /> <br /> The taste is certainly bad, even for a cheese-skewed movie in the ...
