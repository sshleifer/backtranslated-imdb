Watch this on DVD in the original language with English submarines. Either the interpretation was too bad or the actual dialogue does not make much of the story and gives any evolution to the characters. There are quite a few Hong Kong stars in this film but the film does not need to be there to make it better or worse. It's just bad. Bright and colorful scenes in CG are attractive to transparent colors and glittering but can become overwhelming long before. If anything makes me think of a kid movie with a constant barrage of CG and fighting scenes and a crap plot. I'm sure I realized what happened in the film but the delivery of the whole story was pretty poor.
