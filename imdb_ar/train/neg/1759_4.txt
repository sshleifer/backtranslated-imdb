It was like a brilliant television movie ... I do not remember that he was ever released in the theaters ... if so, he must have died quickly. By watching the DVD, in our cozy bedroom, it was clear that this film was not meant to be much more ... Ed Lutter is a technical critic with a series of greed? It's a fun turn ... I have not seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... everyone else behaves pretty much in numbers, led by Baldwin, except Pompeo ... she had a zero charisma and seemed to sleep through most of the picture ... The daughter of Pompeo had her after one ... I played every scene like a lovable little puppy ... The slowest delivery line for any 3 year old I've seen after ... <br /> The scenes of stalking my wife and I gave a crack ... a lot From quick pieces and chopping corners ... If you want to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you may need a few WIDE footage to exploit the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was unbelievable and out of reach, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
