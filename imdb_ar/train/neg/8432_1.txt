Leave it to geniuses such as Spanish director Ventura Ponce to convince his country's top officials to support this misleading attempt at a film. The sad state of filmmaking in that country is the result of an attempt to produce a film of such fine materials. Most of the images prepared in Spain fall into two categories: those related to the Spanish Civil War, which likes to present the past history as it sees fit. The other type of film offers the viewer a lot of sex that is not justified because "creators" have no interest in saying. <br /> <br /> With the opening of the movie, we will see Pere's penis trying to cut it and place it in one of the dishes at a party. Later, Sandra will display everything that has been given to the audience to admire. The story of Bair's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film is focused on a previous image better than the master. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately, has nothing to do with the chaos that we punish to see in this project. As far as the comments made in IMDb, all negative votes come from Spanish viewers who talk about volumes coming from them!
