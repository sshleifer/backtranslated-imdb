Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing spoiled about this film. Even if Matte did not make any major piece of art that he used to do his work with a little humor and insanity that made him a delightful Eurotratch exit. But over the past 10 years, he seems to have lost it. This film is empty, nothing to wake us from the deep sleep that sank after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (supposed to be about to snuff?), No reps, no dialogues, just like with a 90'TV movie. It is worse than the last cannibal and zombie soles. So rest in peace Bruno, you will keep in our minds forever anyway, thanks to unforgettable gems as follows: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, jaws jaws and a few other people. So, unless you want to see B Mattei owned by the new jess Franco's Spirit, pass it. Know the profession of this beautiful craftsman and track and enjoy his old films.
