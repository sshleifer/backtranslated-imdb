This movie was terrible. At first, I read the plot summary and it looked good, so I saw it. The representation was awesome. He was almost like a shy camera actor. Everything looks fake. I was annoyed by Edward Furlong, and the second chapter was my favorite some years ago .. I saw him at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> The plot was also foolish. The writers were probably sleep deprived when they reached the lines. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's a good kind of bad film. The person you're watching is just to see how far you can get, so you can tell others how you did not believe the horror of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch it, so then we can appreciate other, better, real movies.
