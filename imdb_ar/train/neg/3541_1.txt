What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money and revenge can spoil your soul ... or something like that. Jay Ritchie, a well-known director of genre re-phrasing, likes more than he can chew with this person. <br /> <br /> Use it for the modern Noir movie to address the theme of a man freeing himself by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemies, and abandoning all his money falling on his face. When Jason Statham no longer fears Ray Liotta, she seems to be pushing Utah crazy enough to blow his head in the final scene. why? Basically, you can not set up Mavi like the character Liotta, who is supposed to have reached his station in life by showing a kind of harsh behavior evident throughout the film, then just make him lead to suicide through a painful smile on Statham's face. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying I miss this point ... I'm not. I understand it? Unsubscribe from the search for wealth and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will make him destroy himself. This seems to be the essence of the film, and this in itself is not the bad premise of a story, although it is hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the skill of making a filmmaker. As Jay Ritchie realizes this, he seems bored with the story and begins to incorporate the red resonances: the scene Statham has touched on a car - why? Launch some scenes as comics from Marvel ... Again, why? <br /> <br /> There are lots of loose threads and unanswered questions at the end of the film, which you can get from all of 2001. Try to figure out these things, or simply accept that there are no answers and that each scene will translate things in its own way. Myself? I was so bored by the tremendous tone of the film that I did not care about it. Frankly, the end can not come very soon so I did not have to sit in any of this false mental mentality. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
