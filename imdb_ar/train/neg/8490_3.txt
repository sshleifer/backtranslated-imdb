This was a nice try for something, but it is very rude and boring to rise above low budget charges. The use of virtual groups works almost, but at some points it fails miserably. They used the small budget, I think. I only wish the story and most representation was the best. There are lots of parts where you see what they were aiming for, and it would be nice to have already reached those marks but they did not. The story is confusing and unbelievable. Transfer DVD is too bad. It does not take much time to watch a movie in one session. This had to be shut down. It was very boring. I can do slow movies. But only make them attractive in some aspects. Visually, wise story, acting, etc. This was not available in all departments so it did not add to the exciting experience. Maybe the next film maker will try the best.
