I still have not got all this; it works on the cable now, and I seem to have continued to appear in the middle of it. The main reason I care about him is that I'm a Bill Picxton fan; he's a very good actor and has always done a good job throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that while I was never impressed with the old series, I loved Kind Thunderbirds and the impact of work. Derek Meddings may have been the best in business during the 1960s and 1970s, and his designs for the international rescue vehicle are superb. The current team has done a good job translating its work into the big screen. <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> This is one lame story. Children are asked to drive, and although they do a good job, it is hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have an eight-year-old son of Brains flying the T2, a huge multi-tonne transfer with all Buick's aerodynamics. Everywhere you look, you see the Ford logo. The product mode is way on top here, which is annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job like The Hood, but he can not do much except through a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film in its very high quality, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable journey. Do not look closely at the mechanism it leads. <br /> <br /> Addition: In the end, I saw all this, and this is worse than I thought. The representation is rather weak, and although the effects are fairly good, the story in multiple scenes has become more interesting. Put an overdone product for Ford is annoying, and children grate on my remaining nerves grate on children. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, this is possible. But not very. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> A word of advice for John Freaks. Take a refresher course at the manager's guild. You can do better, this old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Mdbalij in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came to the middle almost, with Ben, Ron and Sofia on their battlefield on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible for a lame movie to actually be worse, but it was. It was awkwardly bad. <br /> <br /> If this was done straight, and there were no children to be saved, no jokes of cheekbones, that would be successful. As it is, it is just another joy in your childhood.
