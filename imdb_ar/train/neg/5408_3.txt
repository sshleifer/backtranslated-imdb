This review is mostly all spoilers. If you plan to enjoy this movie, you will not read this review. <br /> <br /> This is the problem with children's TV nowadays. Everything is very patronizing and condescending. "Wow, it was fun, was not it?" No it was not. Unfortunately, it seems that children's films have also permeated. This is what the Reindeer Journey is about. I have not seen the "reindeer trip" in a few years, so I may be foggy at some points, but I remember that I was not quite impressed by it at the time. <br /> <br /> The story basically follows a lecturer who gave a book for Christmas. Now, the lecturer is a respected scientist in the flying habits of some animals. I think it was frogs. However, through this book, the master / family man learns that reindeer animals can fly in the same way as frogs. It seems that this book was written by a scientist who for hundreds of years disappeared in the Arctic. Now, if so, you would throw the book from the nearest window. Flying frogs are a natural phenomenon, but the flying reindeer is a fantastic and totally unrealistic concept. But the lecturer is not me, so I think that explains why he decided to travel to the North Pole and leave his wife and son at home with no idea where he went. Of course, things are going on and before he knows it, the reindeer has crashed into his own plane and stranded in the Arctic. <br /> <br /> Do you still follow this? good. <br /> <br /> His family, of course, is devastating. I'll also be, I mean, Happy Birthday. Elsewhere, Mr. Mahathir finds himself in a hideaway town in the North Pole inhabited by dwarfs and a tyrant wearing only red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would do, greet everyone there with open arms. This hidden civilization of the dwarf monsters, and he greets them with open arms. OOOO-kayyyy. They feed him this story as Santa Claus elves and spend year-round making toys for children who have no idea. Mr. Mahathir accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa Claus is actually a world that disappeared 200 years ago or whatever. There is only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world can not know their secret existence. After all, before they know there will be McDonalds and Starbucks in every corner of the street. <br /> <br /> Are you still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, you find Mr. Gentleman's family a nice book and assume he went to the North Pole. Boy, would not they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a quick walk? Before the public knows it, they set out to spend Christmas in the original winter wonderland on the planet. At the same time, the lecturer is sick of all the pygmies and decides to leave. I can not remember exactly, but I remember him holding Santa Claus at gunpoint. A firefight breaks out when the dwarfs attack and can escape through Santa's sleigh. With Santa Claus fever in his eyes and bloodshed in his eyes, Mr. Whatever, with some wonderful facts, finds himself flying alongside the plane of his family looking for him. So he jumps to their plane, the planes come back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The truth is that there have been some horrific movies that have been made on behalf of Christmas over the years but because of their display this celebratory charm goes unpunished. This magic, which is completely devoid of the "reindeer journey" is not a big mistake in that; nothing offends the intelligence (well, obviously there is, but it is a children's film and thus can escape such things) or anything particularly offensive, The problem is that there is nothing right in that too. It just does not feel Christmassy. For the film about Christmas, it's a big drawback. But hey, do not think of the mind of the target audience of the reindeer flight around it? Why should they? They are all anesthetized on sedatives that may not have been able to spell "Christmas" <br /> <br /> Give it three out of ten. If I have a TV movie I will add two other stars. We all know how bad they can get.
