First of all, I liked Ray Bradbury's novel. It is a kind of horror that happens under your skin and clears you later. One of his best books, as you know, was Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wayne. I just hope this movie is fine. She had a lot of opportunities, with a wonderful team, like Jason Robards and Jonathan Price. Even Bradbury wrote the script himself. Moreover, it contains PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was overlooked. He lost a lot of horror from the book where Bradbury had to keep the violence to a minimum. All the pictures of the book ... I went. Everything that made you press ... went. <br /> <br /> Then there is the representation. Like many Disney films in the 1980s, children in this film can not act. This bothered me a lot, none of them looked to 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintances. <br /> <br /> You believed that Jason Robards and Jonathan Price could achieve this in the roles of Mr. Halloy and Mr. Dark. But here they seem they do not care. All they want to do is pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best offers. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine like a witch, but was not pulled well. It is much less evil and has no existence as it did in the book. <br /> <br /> Everything that has been excluded from the book. Chasing the night balloon, marking Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Kogan in a fun tour, the fate of a lightning bolt vendor, the real death of the witch, and much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects were bad, even in the eighties. It was not a happy round of a vortex for one thing with horses overlapping around it really creepy, and that strange green fog that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could have continued to separate this film from the original novel, but it makes the blood boil. Do not see this movie but read the book. It's the classic of Bradbury.
