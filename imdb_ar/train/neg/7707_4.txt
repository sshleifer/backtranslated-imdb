With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" , Anyone who goes to this thing expects either a bad fiction film or a comedy that makes fun of bad science fiction movies. It is supposed to be a combination of the two with a cynical dose of parody. Unfortunately, it will fall very soon. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, but I realize it, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? I found that a few jokes or attitudes were funny (such as side-by-side phone conversations, Russian Olympic spy dealing with steroid pills, Superman walking by Lewis, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" strives to be a classic cult, but it does not make it. Both cult classic is a film so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). Any 8-year-old child can enjoy a "tomato killer attack" with a bad sense of humor, so he is not eligible for a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is one good actor in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lewis Fairchild. She is a thin reporter, but she has a kind personality, and likes to exaggerate writing, a natural comedy. Unfortunately, they are used badly here. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Tomato Attack" is not as funny as "Amazonian Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried", but it does so for a few fun moments, so I still recommend seeing it once. Avoid cutting the director, interrupted by the producer of the film and some footage that is supposed to be "lost" called the African accent (can be found in English on a printed tape).
