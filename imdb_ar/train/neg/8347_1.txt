The title should have been "The walker". This was the only one who walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the movie that was good. The description of the movie does not match this plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the film is that it was a good runner, but a terrible person in life. > <br /> I'm sorry I spent my money and time in this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the film. I stayed in the hope that it would be better .... what a mistake. It has worsened. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion I can make for the product, it is redirecting its life to another field, because filmmaking is certainly not a cup of tea
