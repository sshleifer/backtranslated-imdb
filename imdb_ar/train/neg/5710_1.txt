Well, it looked good on paper, where Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborated again, this time on a mix of the film Theft, the Danishi Cod, American History 101, and Indiana Jones. But my dear, this is for Indiana Jones, speed 2 is speed. Reasonable casts (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a childish text and loses heavily. The film is nothing more than an extended ad about Freemasons. Although these Freemasons are not your usual owners who use funny handshakes and golf, these Freemasons are the descendants of nature to the Templar knights (no one mentions "hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think I have uncovered any spoilers plot because there is nothing. There is no real suspense, no surprises or climax - it just stops. National Treasure is aimed at Dan Brown, but he hits the same intellectual level as a Scooby Doo episode without humor.
