What a load of garbage .. I can not even begin to describe the magnificence of this film. The classification here is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... especially if you enjoy the first ginger. The first film was well written, well directed and executed well .. A wonderful film with a beautiful aesthetic and a wonderful atmosphere. The second was 'alrite' - decent as a stand-alone film, but obviously it does not reach the level of the first ... and the third insult to the series, this period. Films were made: 10, 6, 1. It's bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, they've really been set up in the past, and the sisters are still called Ginger and Bie Fitzgerald ... all of them are mixed up with some of the original American legends half-ass. The sisters do not have any real story, progress or even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and be "forever". This is as deep as it is. <br /> <br /> Stunning that the girls agreed to be in a pile of shit, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing, starting off the work was terrible - people were showing up from anywhere regularly, like girls turning around and there was a nicely prepared candlelight setting with an American woman out of a woolly sitting there just about to get into a speech. The groups were awful, could not get away from the fact that it was obviously based on a group, which did not really help. Also, there was constantly snow outside the camp, but there was no trace inside (.. on the group). <br /> <br /> Arrghh,, Too bad! You really hope to be at least as good as the second.
