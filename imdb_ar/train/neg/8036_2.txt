Do you want to know you guys? This movie sucks. Well, I do not really know that if you allow yourself to indulge in stolen versions of original movies, you may find this movie amazing (this is a stolen copy of what I knew last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a model story; a group of nice teenagers are called to spend their holidays in Florida and they act much like the events. The only insight we have reached at this stage is the extent to which the director managed to show the buzzing sensation of adolescent degeneration within the characters. The second half of the film acquires a little momentum and begins to illustrate the unprecedented start of unprecedented killings. Surely the first half of the third hour of the film will remain a mystery to me because I turned it off before I could fool myself more in the belief that the film might still have something interesting and left the original for the show. As for the story, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy at parties, they slowly (and I mean slowly) start to kill because they know some sort of strange secret. The only thread of killings is that all the victims were students in a joint high school. The only thing that surprised me about this movie, is how much my house looks (I'm not sure about her name .. personal blonde) like Reese Witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the film was that it made me jump out of my seat several times. Does this make him a work of art? Certainly not because my 12-year-old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she "mocked" me when I was about to enter the guest room door. What was the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece? ???? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure you guys, but I'm not.
