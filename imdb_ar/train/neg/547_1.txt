The full title of this film is "Time: Race Against Time". It's a race no one can win, but you can certainly reduce the margin of your loss by not wasting any precious "money" on this spot. This film was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look sincere. My credibility was strained too far. He was ridiculously stupid in his story, and deserved to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, useless, with OTT performance ridiculed by Amitji. The central "conspiracy" is another bad example of the blunt propaganda that is rampant in many "biological weapons" films of the family. If my father, who is my Lord, loves dearly, treats me like Big Akshay, I will shoot him myself. To say something trivial from a terminal illness.
