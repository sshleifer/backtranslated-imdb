There was a wonderful film about Steve Pico. Unfortunately this was not. Denzel Washington - never the most resilient actors - is completely unable to deliver the great charisma that Pico had. The large crowd scenes at Attenborough are laughable. The Soweto massacre was not so, there are three rows of children (some making the fight!) Happily walking in the guns of the soldiers. With Pico dead the film quickly descends into a farce. If the struggle against apartheid was anything, it was a fight for black people, but we all assumed to be escaping from a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Pico was important while he was not. The tone of Penelope Wilton is pure Hampshire and it seems that she is not fully aware that she is in South Africa at all. Absolutely. The Wood family dog ​​gets more lines than the black maid. While the family survived their escape, the women who saw the film with them - by the way one of about a dozen blacks in a large and full cinema - whispered "this is like the sound of music." She had a point. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good-intentioned white film if it is somewhat incompetent about the struggle of the extreme black people. South Africa really needs well-meaning liberals just like a hole in the head.
