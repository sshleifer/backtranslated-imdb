*** Review may contain some spoilers *** I will make this revision short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because he looked interested and has some outstanding actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Well, that's very bad. Justin Timberlake plays Paul Pollack, a seasoned journalist who stumbles on a case that could lead to corrupt police in the Edison police force. LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special power team called F.R.A.T. (First respond attack tactics). He collaborated with a bad policeman "on the edge" named Lazirov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene, we see Lazerov & Deed dealing with some bank thieves, but at night they break up a couple of men taking drugs. I do not want to give much, but things get worse for men who use drugs. Paulack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes on trial for Deeds & Lazerov. Was suspected of playing wrongly and with the help of Ashford, are some investigating this ugly thing. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who is all in the F.R.A.T. team. The team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt police to justice. <br /> <br /> You can learn from the start that the performance of Freeman and Spisay is rather weak. The only person who offers a comprehensive performance is Dylan McDermott. Is a complete case of walnut in this film and make me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this film. Each line says the same way and shows pretty much the same feelings. He has been much better at films like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film begins with some gentle movements but pulls it through the rest of the film. The end is not satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I'm putting it on ebay this weekend.
