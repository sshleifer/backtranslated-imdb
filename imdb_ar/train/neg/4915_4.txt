One former reviewer wrote that there does not seem to be a compromise for the views of the story of love. I love or hate it. But there seems to be a great distribution of views on a scale scale of 1 to 10. For me, this category has been rated 4. There are some beautiful sights and locations, and Ray Milland turns into a wonderful job as Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly convincing job in telling his story, and the story was not unique enough to warrant multiple scenes, at least not for me. I may be a bit pessimistic, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neill - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all of them, were ruined because of his presence. The only exception is "What Up, Doc?" , Where his straight performance is an ideal line for Barbara Streisand's Goofball hero - not coincidentally, to pick up Love Story! McGraw and O'Neill tend to distort their lines instead of representing them. <br /> <br /> This is a major film at the beginning of a good career: it was the first Tommy Lee Jones movie.
