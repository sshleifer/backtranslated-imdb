Two houses, one street, one telephone booth, one car, a neighboring girl, a nearby boy and a zombie. This list of components must be sufficient for a great horror film. All you need is some blue light and surrounding music and ... done. Not in the hands of Dutch director Van Roverwei! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie evenings" from time to time. The concept is very simple: get some wine, get friends who love movies, and bask in the worst movies you can make. On this evening, this calmness is one of the best. Laughing Guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that Van Rufuy still defends her film as if it was a wonderful achievement. To be a witness to this, you should listen to the comment track on the DVD. Again: infidelity and laugh the content!
