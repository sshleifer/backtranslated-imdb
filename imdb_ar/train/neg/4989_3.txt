Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval travelers was already funny. I loved Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected shifts, funny attitudes, and of course absurd, that would remind you a bit of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now, the sequel of this series corresponds to the same characters and the same actors in a large part and the same thing as the time of travel. The plot changes a little, as the characters are now supposed to be experienced travelers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting ridiculous as you progress in the film. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep everything with his game, but his character has been emptied, so there is not much he can do to save the film. <br /> <br /> Now Abdul-Duqq / an assistant, he really has all the attention. The film revolves around him only and being awkward / annoying / stupid or whatever it is supposed to be. The truth is, this character tries to produce laughter from the audience, but it does not work. It seems like someone was telling you a very bad joke, you know, but he insists on telling that joke to the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you love Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you will never think of seeing a sequel. If you like this supplement ... well, I think you still need to watch a lot of movies.
