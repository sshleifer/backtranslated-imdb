The first thing the First Power seeks is that it gives Jeff Cooper a chance to play one of a variety of psychotic villains who have done a good job in the last 25 years. Cooper is a successor worthy of Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts back in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough. The First Power is the bright flick that has been wasted. Lou Diamond Phillips has been lost as a LAPD reporter who has a specialty in catching hackers. Kober is his latest lover, but Kober's in the league with less power, they will challenge and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober is given the gas chamber, his soul returns in all its forms. <br /> <br /> McClatty Williamson is at hand as a partner who meets a bad end involving the Devil Horse, Tracy Griffith, Psychic and Elizabeth Arlene as a nun with visions about helping Lu. Will he succeed in fighting troops from abroad? <br /> <br /> As the movie ends, you no longer care about it. If I got really trapped in Turkey. Maybe Satan made him do this film.
