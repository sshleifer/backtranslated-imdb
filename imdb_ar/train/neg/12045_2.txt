Welcome, <br /> <br /> This is my first participation in IMDb although I use it as a reference for a long time. So I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my appreciation and I hope you will not be disturbed. <br /> <br /> I have spent two years of my life, (all that we Greeks have already done), and analyze Omirus epos (and not Homer as you can see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I remember well, the Iliad was in eighth grade and Odyssey in ninth grade. Warner Troy was a great disappointment for me and my fellow Greeks throughout the campus (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Elliott Epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by the Greek poet Omirus after 400 years of actual war. Historians developed a Trojan war around 1200 BC, the real reason for the war was not being the beauty of Helen, but the strategic position of Troy. However, one may now understand that Omirus epos does not present actual events (because it is not historically accurate) but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> When reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering about definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, allegiance, and so on. The best part and the most uplifting as well were these lengthy conversations between the warriors before the battle. None of these was detected in "Troy" <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectuals Finnish Finnish and German colleagues to me. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the ideal storm was a bad and stupid turnout (computer graphics did the whole work), yet they are the best works of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that it is better to see something else instead. I'll give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
