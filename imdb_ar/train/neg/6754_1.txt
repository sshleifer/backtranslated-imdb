The only reason I'm bothered to comment on this film is to save you every 97 minutes of your life and probably your money. <br /> <br /> I bought this offer for Â£ 3.00, it seemed interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of its operation, I realized I had made a mistake. The actors' layer must be fully stored until winter and then placed on the nearest firewood, where they can meet more. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (writer and director), it must be a snapshot, unfortunately, it should have been done before making this trash. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in the shops run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
