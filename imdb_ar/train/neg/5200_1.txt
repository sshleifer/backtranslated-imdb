This film is very very very weak. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was some tension but not much to make you jump out of your seat. Start slowly with tension building. This is not success. At least if you ask me. Although at some points or moments, I must say it was a bit funny when people were shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They were supposed to be like Scary, it might be a better film. Because I watched parts of the movie just by skipping the scenes and getting boring from the movie. I must say I felt sleepy when watching this movie, so I certainly can say that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time even thinking about doing something with this movie besides leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
