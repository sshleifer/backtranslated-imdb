The whole world said Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but that's not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya committed a serious mistake in portraying actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable throughout the film. Tomboy's look is not going well. Even movie movie story makes no sense at all. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but not at all Quetin. Talent talents Anil Kapoor participated in this stupid film. Anil is a high-caliber actor and this is not the case. Akshay Kumar was also a victim of this film because everything is a sword. The method and Formula is not really good in this film
