A somewhat amusing piece trying to show how clever Orcas is at the same time (and completely oblivious) makes the public feel stupid by producing the most ridiculous film. Richard Harris plays Quent .. I'm sorry, that's a mistake. He plays Captain Nolan, a hunter who hunts sharks for a living, but is tempted by big fishing and trying to catch a killer whale. When a female whale gets caught (do not ask), her mate (do not ask) goes in a state of frenzy (do not ask) and begins chasing Captain Nolan (do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (do not ask). Very beautiful filmmaking here people. I have to tell you that the start (with whale noise and nothing else) is very painful and the ending balances (with the most godly song) are very entertaining.
