Normally, I do not have trouble swearing in the movies for free, but it really bothered me. All they did was swear. For the whole film. (And as someone else noticed, he got cancer) he was bored, tired and patriotic. I would not be if I were you. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like films that, as most people like, claim, "notice life." I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens is that many Taiwanese live their lives. But I can relate to them. I never met anyone who swore as much as "actors" in this film, and I was working in a construction site. So go figure. After I said that William H. Messi made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy tedium.
