I am very confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all his movies, and many of those times. I can only describe this film as "weird." Stephen Segal is writing screenwriting and producing credits in this film, but I have a very hard time where I think he will choose to clap his voice for many of his lines, with a little supporting voice no less noisy. What I do not get is also, if they have to understand some of its lines, why does it show its voice on the rest of these words? I expect Seagal to be as old as the rest of us. But Seagal in this film hardly exudes part of the same boastfulness, confidence, boasting, charm and sexual appeal that he easily showed us in all his previous films. What I found missing more than anything else was his cocky attitude, confident of himself and the irony of a bad ass who easily moves into that wonderful smile. Where is this attitude in your face and the magic that made it such a huge star ??? I hope this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to recognize that Seagal, whom we all knew and loved, is over.
