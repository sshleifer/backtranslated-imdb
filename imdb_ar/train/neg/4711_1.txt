I really hate this show! I saw one episode, and I knew that this show was very bad. The lines of the story are written and poorly executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean they are just shakes from Dexter and Johnny Quest, a hateful boy with flaming blond hair with twin genius sisters and a modern dog. Father at home and my mother clever and very busy ... Like my God! Their father is a crazy house maker to the mother of relatives, is not this gay! If my father is a house maker, I'll personally die! Of shame ... ... I really like. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else about this ... this farce but only 3 words; count them 3 words to describe them: <br /> <br /> · Lame, stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I can say, it definitely sets the worst EV-ER series! If I have one that is.
