In Steve Irwin's show, it's hilarious. So he does not try to be funny and he just has it but his film was not even what I call a film - I mean when that guy who was driving in his car tries to kill him, he just says "Oh, that's a bad guy! When the crocodile ate Steve almost say "Steve." Did not look scared or anything, it was just Steve. I hate to express the sound but this was not worth watching.I love Steve Irwin, but his film was very stupid.
