The film "City called Hell" (also known as "A Town called Bastard"), a joint British / Spanish production, was produced following the success of Clint Eastwood in the Italian Untitled Man series. The template used in most of these films was to hire well-known American actors, whose vocation was largely reduced and their voices voted. This film is no exception except the fact that they also used some British actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is hard to sum up, but here. The story begins with insurgents or anything, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who raided a church and killed everyone inside, including the pastor. He progressed quickly to the controlled city a few years later, disguised as a priest. The town's mayor (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think of justice with his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw the mixture from the sad widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) looking for her killer husband. Add to that the fact that she wanders in the heart of a dead lie as in a coffin because God knows why. After the mayor was killed by his followers, La Bomba, the city invaded a federal colonel in search of a leader of the rebels (I am sorry but the name escapes me). The colonel takes control of the city and begins to execute the residents of the town in summary to force them to reveal the identity of the commander. <br /> <br /> Although they have opened the movie side by side, it is hard to figure out that through dialogue the personalities of Landau and Shao know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims that the rebel leader can be identified by touching his face. Do so and .................................. < br /> <br /> I am sure that managers are sorry about the production of this film. It's just awful and well deserved by my dreaded "1" rating. "Shaw" spends most of the film staring at his trademark. So Lando can not save this movie. The beautiful lady Stevens is quite lost here too. Having just made Peckinpah "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" the previous year, I found it strange to appear in this chaotic movie. Savalas has done many of these images ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express") during the pre-Kojak era. Michelle Craig is also somewhere as a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey has appeared in many of these "Westerners" although he will appear to play the villain in two films "The French Connection." Laitiri will also appear in the role of The Godfather (1972) and continue in other memorable roles before his sudden death in 1975. In all fairness, the version I watched ran only 88 minutes away from longer running times Which is 95 or 97 minutes in the IMDb, but I can not see where an additional difference will occur for 7 or 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Avoid this time.
