I caught "The Lost Sorrow" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I have some great hopes for this film. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX connection card. The story is very lame. Poor lighting and camera, along with less-than-brilliant editing and music, make the film look low-quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really possible to ask that FX shorts have better stories and the rest of the artwork will be on par with FX! You can no longer escape the great foreign exchange market in shorts. It's been 5 years since I made the 405 game. At least this short, fast, cool, and was so funny a bit! No one can say anything about "lost sorrows".
