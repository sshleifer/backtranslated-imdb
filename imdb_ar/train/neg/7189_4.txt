What an absolute disappointment! The result 6.1 in here on the IMDb has accumulated some moderate expectations, but my oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me is those college kids who have stereotypical ideas. Yes, I know teenagers can be young and so on, but why are they always portrayed in movies as strong spirits? There was one character I thought was fine, but (she was not revealed here) was killed far from the end. Other characters were poorly executed and even the supposed hero / hero did not do it for me. On the plus side: the plot is very good and estimates the productions a bit higher than this kind of clicks. The acting was not generally good, as Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But everything fails with cute and braindead characters. Stop caring for them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (this will be generous).
