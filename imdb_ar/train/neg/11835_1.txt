If I could give this garbage less than one star! There were two moderately armed parts of the entire film and that is it! One was the place of a song or two lines of "Do not Worry," "Be Happy," sung by mollusks, and the other where Roddy fell on the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs. This is that there was nothing more entertaining than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right to say, "Shrek fans may be very ugly, but fans of Wallace & Gromit are likely to be disgusted, I also liked partner 1 and 3 and also liked Wallace and Gromit. Very good it is definitely worth watching, but that was far from being good, and maybe you can get it! The errors of continuity were too big in number. Some other things to see: When the young girl leaves at the beginning of the film, the catch falls to Ba The cage has a part of the hook on the right that is clearly behind the round handle, making sure that Roddy will not be able to get out, but he does so as soon as he kicked in. At one point Ruby drops Roddy's back and is pushed straight into the air by Rita all the time while In the next scene, Roddy caught up again, this is impossible, seeing the way the ship moves forward is the only place where the ruby ​​was taken out of the bottom of the Rudy shirt, the only place where he could land was in the water and not in the hand Rudy. There was a third person I wanted to refer to, but now I forgot it. <br /> <br /> "Jokes" have been repeated too often, or because of a better word, there was not enough time to establish any kind of contact with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and a whole movie left you want .... would like to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Drying the paint or cultivating the grass are two wonderful choices!
