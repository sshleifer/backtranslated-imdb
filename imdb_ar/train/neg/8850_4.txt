Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was exciting for two reasons - two big reasons and one smaller - that's three reasons, is not it. <br /> <br /> The first reason for this interesting is the special effects. I found them to be very interesting and fairly amazing. To watch the hair grows in Marsha a. Hunt and Sibling Danning was a creep, especially when they were participating in a group of horses. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the fact that Marsha Hunt is the famous "Sugar" of the Rolling Stones song, and that she was in a nude scene in the cast of rock musicians in London. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two important points in this film, and they were taken out again and again during the final appropriations.I lost the count, but I swear that Siebel Daning has blocked these points for us in the final appropriations at least dozens of times Hugh was the film's most prominent filmmaker.
