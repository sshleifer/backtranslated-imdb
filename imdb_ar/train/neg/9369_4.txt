Although I have heard that this film was a bit dry, I see no matter how Scott Bakula. At the beginning of this film, I had great hopes in ending Chase-Classic, but enjoyable, and until the end of the film 20 minutes ago go great. The twist of the plot was crazy, unexpected and very intelligent. I kept my fingers crossed and they would succeed and they would all be a terrible misunderstanding, even when the credits were over and I realized that there would be no happy ending. Unfortunately, I left regret because I saw him and faster in a big leap to restore my faith in Scott's great power!
