Well put into serial killer entry which unfortunately soaked in its own buzz to be really satisfactory. Willem Dafoe is a brilliant New York City detective trying to trace what appears to be a fake copy using the same Renaissance-style killing techniques used in a series of murders that were solved years ago. Scott Speedman is a younger Dafoe partner and has good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters emerge to connect the two situations together. Clea Duval is a friend of a former victim, and Peter Sturmar is a kind of mediator / technical teacher for Davy ... This is a bit difficult, although Stormar, of course, is never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Quickly search for Deborah Harry as a lesser-known neighbor of Davo.
