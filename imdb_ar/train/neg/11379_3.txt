When I first saw a small scene in some ads, I thought the show would be fun to see. The little robot guy does not look pretty nice. The animation style seems familiar to some classic shows. Before the broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There, I became a bit upset. The three children (Tommy, Joss and Lola) are expressed appropriately but Robotboy is an exception. It was better to be photographed by a little boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What Happened to Robot Jones?" The show is not really bad. But the way in which Robotboy is portrayed inappropriately is my only criticism. So, I do not see him very much.
