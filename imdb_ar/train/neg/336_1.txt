Why when a star reaches the top of the series of stars, they destroy all the good work by producing a bad film? Peert Reynolds peaked, and then began to make Horrible Needham Hull cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, just to call the irony of himself with the hero of another horrific movement. Here, Eddie Murphy glorifies the memories of trading places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure, one of the most indecipherable, outrageous, and unusually common, with the opportunity to see the two big Charlotte Lewis breasts in a tight blouse. The most attractive aspect of the entire film. <br /> <br /> The story is pure moisture. It comes to the social worker Murphy, who contacted him by mysterious types and told him that he was chosen. I chose why, I hear you ask. His mission is to save a Tibetan boy with inner powers from the race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main devil, the elegant actor Charles Dance looks very embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he got a good payoff in exchange for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy films, this is the worst easily. I have read some reviews that suggest that it is good to see Murphy in an unusual role, in an opposite type of film, and although both points are largely correct, there is no tolerance for the fact that the film - however unusual and not the opposite It may be - an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
