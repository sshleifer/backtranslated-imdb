Is there anything happening in this unpredictable film? I do not think so. Basically the film is cliché after cliché and really nothing comes as a surprise. It makes the film very predictable and because of that, the film also suffers from a severe lack of tension. Therefore, for excitement, it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as drama, it is a failure. This is because the film his story is very unlikely. I mean, this can not happen at all in real life, as happened in the events in this film. So the film has a real problem of suspense and credibility. <br /> <br /> But the truth is that the clichés killed the movie. It was swinging at times. Everything is very poetic in this film. The predator is portrayed as a cold, heartless man, mentally ill as a frustrated boy and a victim as a naive young girl who behaves as if she does not see any of this coming. Everything that happened in the film was very clear and everything seemed to have happened for some reason. Such as the sequence in which the "Predator" is working on repairing the broken "victim" car. This should be one of the oldest cliches in the book. I knew what the film tried to achieve after this point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing towards each other through the eyes of other people around them. It was so incredibly clear and cheap that I wanted to stop watching the film after that point. The film is full of moments like this. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that this is a cheap pornographic film, but this is actually a film designed specifically for a television movie. Which means that everything happens slowly and that the film spends half its time developing unnecessary characters and sub-plots to make the film more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Elizabeth Berkeley works well in this film. They make some cliches and events seem so realistic sometimes. Her career in Hollywood is as good as it ended after appearing in the movie "Girls of the Show" Paul Verhoeven, so unfortunately, it will probably only appear in television series and movies like this series. It is a waste of talent and certainly deserves the best. All other characters are disappointing. Corrie Severs plays the role of the rich boy cliche "who can not be touched" and the way in which the husband's worst personal character is portrayed. He is more like a frustrated predator than a real predator of a movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. Wakes up, wants sex. Before going to sleep, wanted to have sex. Arrives at home and wants to have sex. This may be something realistic, but I do not know, I did not feel it was appropriate for a film like this and the story in general. <br /> <br /> A film full of cliché and I can not think of it for any reason why anyone should watch this movie predictable and that's why it also lacks suspense and credibility. It is not a "terrible" film, and it is certainly a famous film at times, but all the weak and cliché elements in the film make it far from the favorite film. <br /> <br /> 4/10
