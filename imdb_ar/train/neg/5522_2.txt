I was looking for the right words to describe this film. At first I was inclined to simply move on to more important issues, because the film does not rise to a level worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped and was puzzled by how I describe these things and fascinated them to some extent the challenge posed by the question: "What can one say about such a film?" Garbage? No, not from garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? No, greenhouse gases, not greenhouse gases, help plants grow significantly and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I came across the phrase "not bad", a rephrase of the phrase "not wrong" sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a hopelessly flawed theory and not even worthy of correction. That's all, then, Georgia Rule: Not bad.
