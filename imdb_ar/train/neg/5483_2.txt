I just blew four dollars rent this movie! Why the Atlantis Alliance promotes such a weak excuse for a film is beyond my control. But the most surprising thing is the reasonable reviews by two critics of the Canadian press. I'm tired of justifying the media for the film because it's simply a CAD and a low budget. It looks as if they expect the Canadian films to be poor, so they give them a good review regardless. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The acting was below average (except for the leading male character, which was actually very good). The quality of the film was poor, and I think it can be expected from a very low budget. The script was very awful. One example is the story of a prominent figure, a drug dealer roaming around with one of her clients so she can recruit him to repair and steal bikes for her gang, which only aims to randomly destroy SUVs. It is assumed that many of the gang members' bikes are being destroyed in these activities (I do not know how they can only buy new ones, because this is supposed to be a great drug trade relationship from Vancouver to Toronto). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the point of the story (which is not even revealed halfway through the film) is that the drug dealer plans to shoot at the burning bomb buildings in the Toronto area to try to make homes affordable - where One does not want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I need to say more. <br /> <br /> The Toronto Film Festival is a shame to accept such a film, and Telefilm to support it, and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers to give them these biased comments. <br /> <br /> The movie should not get special treatment just because it's CAD !!!!
