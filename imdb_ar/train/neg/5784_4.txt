I was not nearly fond of this number of other reviewers. Sure, he has a pair of pretty girls playing vampire lesbian lesbians. Marianne Morris and Anolka de Siren play these beautiful sirens with prickly teeth reaching the cars on the road away from the road, linking them to her home (at dusk), and calling prey ... men starving to sex to deceive them. What happens there ... well, after they take off and accept each other, they kill their visitors. Director José Ramón Larraz has some sparkle in the Kamerah. Some scenes are quite strange and are effectively photographed, but sex alone does not carry any film (no pun intended ... at least consciously). In fact there is not much of the story here. We have two girls. We have shown some start that can not be explained and unexplained where we see them firing from the gun. why? What does it mean, "Why do we have a person who stays for days to meet someone in the hotel who insists he has known him for years?" Of course, I have more general questions, such as the beautiful girls who work as bloodbaths in the English countryside and have a full wine cellar In any case, the script is full of such flaws, as it is very sparse in the work outside the victims of fishing, wine and eating (quite literally), then go to bed in the basement, where the end ends with some exciting scenes, but they are hostile to the climate , As I said, there are some effective scenes for the director ... Especially the way the girls wear them and are photographed in the forest looking for their prey, and the house is also one of the most impressive collections, both girls as I said very wonderful, Marianne Morris especially - in more ways than the older film lovers, veteran silent screen Bessie Love has a brief veil to the end of the film.
