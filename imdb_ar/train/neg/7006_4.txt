Mark Hamil should have been very embarrassed by the Sumer Corvette! This time, he uses a new kind of "power" to regain possession of his dream machine, the Vette in light red. It looks like a sour teen another flick in the first half of an hour and turns in a direction towards the wrong direction. Writing and routing tasks are scary, with some scenes you can not see. You would expect this to happen anyway, and you also inhaled the scent of Hoodbodge in the late 1970s. Just a former ex-comer like Annie Potts steals the show easily and saves this poor film from creeping repo! Her impersonal but exhilarating personality keeps your interest, and this is the best chance to see her in swimsuit. Shout for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think the force was not with you this time.
