It's just an improvised process of "killing, it's written" better without limits, it's very amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for eight full years. I'm sure most of the people who saw this uninhibited nonsense were in their sixties and seventies and they just followed us because they did not do anything better, or simply remembered their star from the old Dick Van Dyck show. Van Dyke, who had only a decent career in the 1960s, was never represented (by his own admission) and was actually too big to play as a doctor when the series began in 1993. It seems quite old as a result of years of smoking Chain and drinking wine. His unrealistic son, Barry, the wooden actor who seldom in anything his father did not share, plays the role of his son in the series.
