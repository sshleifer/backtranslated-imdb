where do I start? According to the title of this film, I was expecting a degree of originality, and in the end I failed badly. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, but is the story of Hollywood (or choose a filmmaking center) based on some real life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the preface to the film in German; the red blood text (title and artists) should have been the idea of ​​2ND. The story of the story is fabricated (Lille was not excluded from his parents Rolf Lieberman in Switzerland, there is no information that Lieberman helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside the control of the NS system and not under control, the record was played at the station in Vienna while The lieutenant there on vacation, etc., etc. The costumes were bad and incorrect for the time frames (SS black uniforms used everywhere from border guards to staff positions, these were far from daily use once the war started, etc., the characters are Stereo types (SA Bulls in the club once were basically Kha C power). Do not waste your time.
