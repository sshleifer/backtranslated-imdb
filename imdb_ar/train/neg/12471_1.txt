When I was living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket to Sereana. After watching the trailer, and being a fan of excitement, I was expecting first of all a quick and attractive film, wisely immersed in global policy making and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, from a new angle. Well, I left the movie almost in the middle. The pace was painfully slow. Almost all the characters were stereotypical, and interlocking editing made sense very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you do not care. Save your money, save your time, and choose another one. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
