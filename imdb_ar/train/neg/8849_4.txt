This is a very bad film. But not as bad as his reputation suggests. Production values ​​are not too bad and there is a strange sight effective. It has a cheezoid cortex 80 which means it's always kind of fun. Watch out for Jimmy Nail's short appearance - his attempt with an American accent is a staggering nonsense. Also wonderful are Sybil Danning's two breasts - briefly appearing in the film, but the scene is repeated several times at the end of the credits period in what can only be described as "Remix 12" from Sybil Danning's breasts. Must see that he believes. It is a horror film that is not scary. The effects are ridiculous. Christopher Lee becomes sleepy through his performance. I think he was buying a new house and needing some money to deposit. A woman - she was so insignificant that I almost forgot about her, I saw this movie early in the night. Wound wolves are remarkably less impressive than the original film, in fact, strange, sometimes look more like the badly burned monkeys. The European atmosphere is very good and the music provided by the new Babylon Band, although awesome, but it gives the film at least some added cheese. <br /> <br /> In general? Good for laughter. Not good but is a wily seriou expect to be? At least, you always have Sybil wrestlers.
