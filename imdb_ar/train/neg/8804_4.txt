The wonderful CGI effects and performance really deserve Oscar by Gary Senis as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-of-a-kind scam film in this movie, how he won the Best Actor Oscar of that year for Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> This film is a deceptive love message to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing bias, ranging from Forrest in Vietnam to "The Solution" with Jenny End. <br /> <br /> However, it is very entertaining and an American film through and through. I have found certain parts of this film very offensive, Zemeckis has overlooked this film almost to the same Gump level. . Perhaps that was the point he was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the right choices and has been in the "right place at the right time" for the last 45 years. Those who are mistaken by the director's vision seem to be paying a heavy price. Does Zimkes say that foolishness disguised as innocence and naivet√© is of national quality, even American?
