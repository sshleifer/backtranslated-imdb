After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to come together and make a similar film based on a selection based in New York. Unlike the original film, it seems that the stories in this film sometimes come and go very quickly - by the time you think the story's intervention, it ended up in many cases. They often start and stop and then start again - with stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that the story is complete and informal in its structure. <br /> <br /> However, unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" has been beaten or missed (mostly hit), most of the "New York, I Love You" Miss. Stories tend to be more sexual in nature but also less sweet - and often too awful. It was a boring and surprising film with a few extraordinary stories - and perhaps the frustrating music often makes it seem more than that. Now I understand, it's good quality music but its really bad accent, made me really feel like I cut my wrists! Among the best of them is the story of the young man who took a wheelchair girl for a concert, the couple talked about cheating outside a restaurant (although this was also in the first film) and the old couple. All this is very sad because I loved the first film a lot - and I really want to love this film. I respected what they tried but I simply did not like much. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not really a complaint, but I am amazed at how many people were smoking in the movie. For a modern film, this was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get a DVD, there are two sections that are included as extensions that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a cold fedora) eating hot dog .... and nothing at all for about ten minutes. The other shows a teenager spending the film on a video of the world - including a couple very unhappy.
