My husband and I bought the old school's Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I must say, I do not allow her to watch the new episodes on TV, because I find all the characters disturbing. Bear baby and short? OMgosh, how can anyone annoying and flickering useless to think about "plays"? Elmo? I do not rest every child loves him, again, annoying and does not teach my child anything. Mr. Nodel? What a rejection. I think the first time I run her "new" show, I'm left and I'm stupid than before. The offer has definitely taken a wrong turn. The great works of OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street have suffered from direct boredom and numbness since Jim Henson's death in 1990. The show no longer contains the funny and interactive educational plays he is used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless educational chatter. A way to go to American producers and writers who have another cartoon show for parents to sit there are non-creative and non-practicing children in front of them until they get out of their hair. For each product / book: I suggest you hit the old dolls and start recording content similar to the content of the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows that I certainly do not want to talk to my baby like Baby Bear or Elmo.
