For romantic comedy films, I often judge the quality of the film based on my eye fog at the end of the experiment. Unfortunately for The Wedding Date, I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to Debra Messing fans and Dermot Mulroney, but I have not seen much chemistry between two characters. The film's premise is "The Beautiful Woman", where Dormot plays Nick, an expensive male escort hired by Cat Debra to accompany her. England to attend her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship is supposed to develop between the beneficiary and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. There were not enough romantic sparks to fly in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In a supportive role, Amy Adams was the most prominent sister of Kat. When Amy appeared on the screen, she acted as a sparkle and stimulated the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams was cast as a cat, the film might have a greater dynamic. But as it turned out, instead of reaching Kleenex, I was looking for Visine to try at least to pretend that this film had some real romantic feelings.
