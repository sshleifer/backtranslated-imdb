Encouraged by positive comments about this film here, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad error. I've seen more than 950 films, and this is really one of the worst - it's great in almost everything: editing, speed, lines, "representation", soundtrack (the only song of the film - melody of a lame country) less than four times. The film seems cheap, very bad and boring. I was rarely very happy to see the end credits of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving this result is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance, he seems to be at least making some effort. One Keitel amateur only.
