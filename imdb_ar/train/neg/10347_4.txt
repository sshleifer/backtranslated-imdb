I just saw Adam four sons for the first time, and the thing that surprised me is that I think the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were almost the same age as the four boys in this film. Warner Baxter spoke in his portrayal of Adam Stoudard about the same values ​​and family traditions that I had heard from our twenty-sixth president without some of the most exciting aspects of personality in TR's personality. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all Stoddard's sons serve in World War I, in this case even though the younger one loses his eye instead of killing. <br /> <br /> But what if a Minx female in this household got a male and things went wrong? This is the work of Susan Hayward here. In one of her first prominent roles, Hayward is an immoral immoral girl who marries a boy, has an affair with another, and begins to play for the third. He is an early pioneer in this type of part which later made him an Academy Award in I Want To Live. <br /> <br /> I assume that with a strong model of comfort like Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter, everyone is afraid to tell the father what is going on. Sons and also the nanny Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a bit silly. Bergman was introduced to us as a nanny hired by Baxter and Phi Ray's wife for their children. Ray Baxter suffers from some financial setbacks in business. Bergman must be left. She returns to France and then returns to the family when the children grow up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe that the kids need a nanny now. Hayward was right when confronted that it was not the children who brought her back. In the natural course of things, Bergman would continue her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I made was released. This is probably why many of our holes exist. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have made another film together in the 1950s when Hayward was on the rise and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam's four sons. I am willing to believe that a great deal of Ingrid left on the floor of the cutting room.
