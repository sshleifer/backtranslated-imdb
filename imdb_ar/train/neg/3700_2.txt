Because this is the only way you will not think that this movie is a waste of time and money. A new edition of "Heaven Can Wait", (which was worth seeing at least) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's a way to give Rock some time in the film for a weak comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially since his jokes are generally supposed to be from the body of an old, rich, rich man, but he appears from Rock himself. Because it humiliates blacks and whites the whole chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, filmed badly, acting poorly at best. Go to Rent "Heaven Can Wait" and direct video of rock music will be at the forefront of the game.
