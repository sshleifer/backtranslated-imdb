Now, I will not deny that when I bought this eBay, I had high expectations. This was an unbelievably amazing work from the comedy master I enjoy. However, I was soon to be disappointed. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I found that "Compleat Al" is hard to see. I got some smilies, but most of the funny videos came from music videos (which I got on DVD) and the rest were basically stuffed. You can say that this was not the greatest video achievement for Al (this honor goes to UHF). Frankly, I doubt whether this will lead to a DVD move, so if you are a fan of the very hardcore Al and you own everything, buy a bar from eBay. Just do not pay much for it.
