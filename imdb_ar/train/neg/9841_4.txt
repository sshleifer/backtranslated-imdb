I really, really wanted to love Julian Bo. I think Slater underestimates him as a representative, and that many of the supporting players here are better than giving them a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this depends on a short story I have not read. Therefore, I do not know whether what I see is the film's faults from the story or dictated by the director / screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, I like the voice commentary, the sectarian tone, the opening blows. But then ...? nothing! Many vulgar local figures ask Julian Blanblanc to explain his intention to commit suicide. One can argue that he does not answer, because it is not their business. But it was Julian, who, under symbolic pressure only, removed his intentions in public. Neither Julian nor the director / writer, despite the fact that the Giulian character maintains a tape recorded in a magazine for God, seems inclined to present anything beyond the meager initial information about Julian's life. He says he was an accountant. He says his family moved as a child because of his father's job. So what? There are many interactions with the locals that seem to be designed to highlight Julian's goal. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to see all of these Aboriginal people as if they were foreigners from another planet, as if he were the only (and only) sage among them. This may be a symbolic story, if Julian Bo has any specific characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to convey. The closest to revealing anything about himself is in the scene that deliberately humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic. What this scene reveals is not something that would inspire sympathy for Julian. I can only see the golian personality - as it was presented - as selfish, trivial, and completely reneging. Somewhat similar to the position of this semi-baked baked film. Poor Michael Parkes, a representative who had promised so much time before, did not give anything to work with.
