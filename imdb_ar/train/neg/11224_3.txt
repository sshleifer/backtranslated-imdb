... and even then, so they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this film (if one wants to call it that) has a real interest only in the whims of slavery. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new at all (I mean nothing *) and will not enjoy the warm feelings of trying anything familiar, loved or loved. <br /> <br /> or less representation of society, total absence of direction, crazy lighting, or any of the production values ​​in the bargain basement. This is definitely "children, to make a film!" Filmmaking of the lowest order. I assume that one can be grateful because they at least know how to turn on the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that this has nothing to do with why this thing is so obvious. <br /> <br /> This is a mistake because the young lady plays the role of Betty Beige, a pretty Zavtij girl who looks just like the queen of the curve is the dark hair and brand explosion, completely fails to bring anything to the role that goes beyond the desire to commit and mute . Obviously this is a good thing for her film career before this miserable appendage and because she is not the same miserable excess, consisting primarily of a number of depressing B & D groups that are depressing among a group of terrible horrific biography scenes that determine the lady's fall of grace Expression). There is likely to be more information, in and of itself, about the life of the page in the opening and closing credits than in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not an accompanying film worthy of "My Notorious Home Page". This is not a good film at all. This piece of fetish is traded on the attraction of one of the greatest tunes of all time, and does so without class, without style, and without any real sense of understanding Bettie Page personality at all. No real Bettie Page fans will find anything but disappointment, and I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. If they are free, remember that time is money too. Your value may not be great, but I bet it's worth enough because you're sorry you wasted time with it. That's it, you're done, you've been warned.
