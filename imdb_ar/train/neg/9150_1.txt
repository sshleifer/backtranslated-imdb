I made a big mistake in watching this whole movie already a few nights ago. God is still trying to recover. This movie is not worth even 1.4 average. IMDb needs to have a rating of sounds possible for films that really deserve such a rating. Version 1.4 represents a very high number. <br /> <br /> I heard how terrible this film was, but I did not really believe that the film could be so bad, especially in this day and age. I used to think that all the horrific terrible films of God were only in the 1950s and 1960s. My God was wrong. Trust me people, this film is really that bad. It's pathetic; it's pathetic; it goes beyond any kind of words I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best picture of the year compared to this movie. The Island Snake (which was by far the worst film I've ever seen) seems to deserve some Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I can not seriously believe that the makers of this cinematic thought was a serious effort to project a Hollywood film. This has no action called film. In the first 25 seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater classes trying to produce a short film. Or better yet, I think it was some Saturday night Live ripoff play for the real thing. I mean, it looks exactly like this. Acting is terrible. The entire film looks like it was filmed with a 20-year-old VHS video camera. Special Effects ....... Well, Lord, good thought from the back of the day he had special effects better than this film. The scene that is shot at the door is beyond laughter and beyond cheese. I mean seriously, my performance in acting four years ago at college, we could all have collected a better film. The worst part of the entire film, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my God I'm almost there. I have a strong stomach, but wow was terrible. Some people should never be nude, one of them. It seems that the plot of this film does not go anywhere at all. They talk about legal issues we never heard of again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never heard of again; Arthur says he's looking for a job and money for college, and the next thing we see is that he runs a porn store. All about awesome movie. <br /> <br /> This really has nothing to do with cash, but everyone knows I'm not gay. I do not support gay rights and I think we should all be treated equally. I would like to support anyone gay in my church, unlike the harsh priest in this film, who by the way seems to curse every other word. (Where is F * (# * ing white?) Hahaha But I did not want anyone to think that I hated this movie just because it was about two gay guys.It has nothing to do with it: it was just as terrible in the film whether Ben & Jill Instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I've just watched this movie to see if it's actually as bad as they say, and yes, it's been worse than I've read, so let this be a warning to everyone: Watch this movie only if you only want Sitting and laughing over how exciting some movies are in the 21st century. If you watch this movie and expect a really good film or some entertainment, I have no sympathy with you at all. <br /> <br /> While Comment on Final Thinking: How the world has 7 movies rated below on IMDb? It's even worse!
