I saw this feature as part of the Asian-American Film Festival in New York, and I was terrified of graphic pornography, the soocho, the child I saw. The story line is hidden down a lot of graphic sex scenes - not one of which is at least sexually - the disease is a feeling. It seems that the director was going to the shock value instead of exploring the different levels of reason for these characters. See if you can stomach - I still have memories of the past.
