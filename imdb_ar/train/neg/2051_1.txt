Because there was no error in acting, etc., writing about this episode was far from this phantom or not phantom series. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see Mars man hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the sixth series, no matter what happens, it is not true what happens and brings nothing real to the serial story except to interview the hunter again and waste 30 minutes to do so. Quite another case of bad writing in the soap opera of Smallville. I really like this show, but thanks mainly to the three episodes and very good episodes each year, but who's always on the writing list that works or is used to work on soap, you should learn. This was by far one of the worst. In the first four minutes, you know that what is happening is false and that anything that happens is a dream that depends on appending Clark clearly because of the Phantom's personality and when he wakes up, he will win and flaunt his blah so that he does not write the book. You must create a truly evil lead to the progress of the story line this week. She may have added another villain to die in the last episode in which the Mars man entered and made him fly away or back and told Clark that he had forgotten his sunglasses to get a closer look at the episode and contacted her daily.
