... so I thought I would be giving some words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see it in its narrow whiteness - obviously it's getting ready for this role and looks very good - or less of it. There is an extended sequence in the cave where he has to undress. There are a few things that should be pursued after Miss Elinayak in the orange, and he only threw his hands over his thigh. William McNamara is naturally on the thin side, but he has a nice and generous bunch of booty. Also, there is a moment when you come out of bed that if you stop working at the very right moment, you can see the entire enchiladas. If you tend to do this and come, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy Men in the "Wild Trip" are. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunities in unwarranted nudity. Could William McNamara act? Heck if you know.
