The video quality is awful. The sound quality is pathetic. The representation is appalling. Dialogue is painful. Bad lighting. Editing is laughable. Can continue, but it will be meaningless. Snitch'd is a third-rate amateur video that is shown as a feature film. It is best to leave this device to collect dust in the display box of the video store.
