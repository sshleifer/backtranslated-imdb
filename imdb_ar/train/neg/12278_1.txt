When you watch this show, I'm not sure whether the story or acting is more disturbing. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, the book must have used every possible clich√©, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the viewer and also the lines of each character, making the presentation somewhat of a college from every police chain there . At the top of all this, the "message" of the show is that the righteous are good and the bad are bad, and that at the end of the day, good must prevail and that we must all love each other and be a better man and a better citizen. Ostensibly. Actors, as the tools of this message and nothing more, will use a limited set of acting skills: "I am a good person carrying" smile, the perspective involved and "victory is" our body, while the bad guys have a look "I am bad, You caught me, "followed by" I am good for nothing and must be removed from society "(this type also summarizes the general development of each view). True story or not, the show is garbage, this is another proof that producers do not give opinions about viewers and think we are all stupid. Well, this series makes every possible attempt to define your living brain.
