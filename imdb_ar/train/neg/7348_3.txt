I was really disappointed with this film. The first Waters movie I saw was my mother's series and I loved it. Then I saw Becker and loved him. Then I saw polyester and really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie was Devine. He / she had a hell of a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole, I do not recommend this movie ...
