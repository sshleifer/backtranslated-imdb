This film was not the most expensive Canadian movie ever in British Columbia, but it was the worst and never saw the light. The director is not Canadian, but Britain and a boy do it. We are all made to be a bunch of demons and pretenders who have sex too much. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be why we fund this bed. Of course the British character is normal. The rest is a collection of stereotypes about the sitcom - can you say "Norm !!"? Cinematography ranges from beautiful postcard pictures to mysterious inner silhouettes. Actors always seem to be restless. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the idea of ​​a film director? Avoid this mess and check out some Bruce McDonald movies. A real Canadian boy with something original to say cinematograph. You will not have to go out in HIS movies after 10 minutes.
