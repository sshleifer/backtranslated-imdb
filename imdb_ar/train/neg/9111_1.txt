The 2 cruel intentions are awful bloody, I mean bad oper. Words can not explain how bad they are, but I will give them anyway. <br /> <br /> The Cruel Intentions 2 plot is very much like the first movie. Sebastien (Robin Dan) is expelled from a private school and forced to move to New York. There he decides to start a new beginning and just normal life and settle down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his sister Catherine (Amy Adams) who wants to drag him down. Sebastian begins to fall in love Daniel (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the school principal. Catherine wants Sebastien to sleep with the entire school that is described as "a whorehouse". Catherine also wants revenge on Chery (Kerry Lynn Pratt), whom she humiliated during the school meeting. Catherine wanted to transform the freshman into the biggest slut in school, a sub-plot similar to the first film. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is essentially a canceled TV program, which has been turned into a preview. There are a lot of problems with the film. It is badly written, mythical, and behaved badly. Fortunately for Amy Adams that the show never started because it is now a fairly large actress. While Cruel Intentions has a sense of realism and can be seen in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is located in the comedy ground and as described in amazon.co.uk "Randy's version of Saved by the Bell". There were some dark aspects that included sex and drug abuse in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 I tried to make them funny and some of the ideas in the film should not be the same, like Katharine having an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also do not work like a secret society where all famous children meet to discuss the fall of other students. The film also faced a major gender problem, which is 15/16 years old. I know that teenagers have sex, and often, but when they are filmed in a movie or television, they are dealt with very seriously. One of the famous feelings was when Daniel Chery (about 14/15 in the film) encouraged the sex simulation on the horse's back to the point where it became orgasmic. The idea of ​​turning a girl around 14/15 into a slut is a very wrong idea with me and should not turn into a comedy theme. The jokes in the film fall, whether it is a verbal frenzy such as "You will become completely wet when you see" in a visual eclipse where Sebastian drives Catherine's face first to the mud. <br /> <br /> There's a lot wrong with this film, which I do not have time to go to, but I say it should be avoided. Only Cruel Intentions, though not classic, is still a good film and the subject is well treated. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a stray dream, where schoolchildren are having sex with each other.
