Kirsten Dunst smiled her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davis as if she thought she was in the film "Legally Blonde." The man who plays William Randolph Hearst outperforms the point you want to get on the screen and slap it. Eddie Isard is very good, but he plays the role of Charlie Chaplin, which is about 125 pounds too heavy for the part? It is hard to believe that this stumbling and uneven wreckage was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but again, he did not make a famous film, what? 30 years? Sometimes, there is no return.
