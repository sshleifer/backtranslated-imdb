Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. But even as a fan, I can only see that this film is modest. <br /> <br /> There is no effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. Now they have just surrendered. They're not even trying. It's a production course, hoping to get a few easy dollars. <br /> <br /> The story does not attract your attention. It is very simple, almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a Survivor of Part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy returns through the child's dreams. At first we learn that to prevent him must find Alice his mother. That's it. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly because there is too little conspiracy, which means it becomes very boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and bad representation. In fact this is the only scary thing, acting, because the deaths are not a bit cold. <br /> <br /> The characters are not very interested and we can not pay less attention to them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unattractive as possible. All the actors reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school plays. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox is still able to bring some rows to this. She is beautiful and exciting and has some talent. But the material did not let it shine. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins's work is not close to the great direction of Rene Harlin in Dream Master. He tries some creative shots near the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven created in previous films is not where to find them. It is the kind of film that gives horror series a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> The end of Freddy is once scary. It is very sad to see him now. Clown This is not funny. Bad joke. Goodbye Freddie.
