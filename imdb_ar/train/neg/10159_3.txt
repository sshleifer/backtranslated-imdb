More hysterical hyperthyroidism in the fifties of the last century gives a new meaning to the behavior of anti-social. Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that all the people involved in the film industry are now dead (or in nursing homes). Kinda thought about prosecuting them for torture. When this film began to launch its offensive offensive offensive shamelessly on the ears of the poor ears that are not around, I felt a strong immediate pain enveloping my entire universe. This muscle vibration can curse Soviet tanks into very small parts, and glass is needed. <br /> <br /> "Why did not you change the channel if you did not like it?" , You may ask angrily. Fair point and fair point ... The answer is that I wanted it, but the pain was so sudden and persistent that I fell to the ground, painfully contaminated. With my last time of energy, I tried to access the remote control but could not. <br /> <br /> Nevine discovered a silly little fisherman with a dubious talent for singing the annoying opera voice, "pigmalionize" him. Lanza Grayson loves asymmetrical, but is expected to treat him with disdain until they finally arrive. This may seem a rather thin plot, but this noisy film is so full of song and music that there is hardly any dialogue at all. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget the torture of hippies and prisoners of war through "Reign In Blood" in Slayer (as in the South Park episode). No matter how little conversation between the silly adults who spread out in this strange musical world in their fifties, they are all childish - as if they were all six years old masquerading as adults. I can only envy people who find movies like this funny. It should be great to be easy to satisfy: what will open up the world of wonder if I can only enjoy any silly old stupidity as a hilarious comedian. <br /> <br /> But let's study this 1950s musical phenomenon. My best guess is that the music of the fifties of the twentieth century gave the idealists who dream of the day a better look at utopia or paradise (depending on whether you go to the church or in the tomb of Lenin), or at least a very delightful version of these fairy tales. Places inspired. TTONO is closer to Hell's representation, but that's just me. I do not seem to "get" the musicals. People talk, there is a story - but then everyone starts suddenly to sing for 4 minutes then suddenly calm down and then pretend that nothing happened unusually! When you think about it, the musicals are strange to any science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Worse still, TTONO (my favorite kind of pizza, BTW) is not just musical music in the 1950s, but a musical with opera. Oprah is evidence of something like sound training - so much so that it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a way to bring pleasure to the listener. The clearest example of this farce is when Lanza and Grayson unite their dark acoustic power from the duo side to get a truly unbearable duet. I tried to lower the volume. I have reduced it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then I end up with 1, which is usually so low that it is only heard by specially trained dogs and certain types of follicles, but I still can hear them The two people are rising like donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in the little boat in the river. Danza begins with one of his silent and destructive songs, and then ... nothing. No animals anywhere to see. Even crocodiles, mostly deaf, have left. If you look carefully, you may even see trees changing color, from green to yellow, within minutes. No, this was not a continuous error; it was an old tortoise for plants. Those trees were just matte paintings! Imagine how the real trees reacted. <br /> <br /> The reason for the glass breaking when it is extracted is high C from the abdomen. The extra weight of a surgical scream is not due to any physical laws related to waves and frequency, but because the glass is only human - so it can cause a lot of pain before suicide through Automatic self-explosion. I can listen to the top metal band and the least friendly for hours, but just give me one minute of soprano and get a severe headache.
