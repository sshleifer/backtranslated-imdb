I do not even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that should not win any prizes. The representation was as terrible as the ridiculous scenarios. This is exactly the kind of film that many people think it meets the needs of an NRI audience, but it really hates the outsider because of the embarrassment that surrounds it and the overwhelming feeling of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that many English-speaking actors find it difficult to do so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure that many readers know what I am talking about - all these symbolic English phrases thrown into a movie and Hindi and regional cinema for great points. There are a few Hindi movies where English is completely original - as Cyrus was a newcomer. Although it is not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem to be "developed". <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of getting the P3 on the NFA in 2005. The only quasi-fun parts of this trash were Konkana and a somewhat attractive background. Other than that, do not waste your time even with this movie.
