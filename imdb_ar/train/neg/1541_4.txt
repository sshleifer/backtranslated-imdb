I strongly hated this film and was left behind in the scene where the pro-gang was shot by the British. The film blames the NI people for causing their own problems. He points out that the 25-year war was an intransigence, unrelated to the division of Britain into Ireland and the dominance of its history. Britain was founded in 1921 regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as lame fools, although I despised the pro-paramilitary forces who were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over Catholic society. It is a well-known fact that British intelligence cooperated with loyalists during the war, no doubt keeping the Catholics in a critical position and destroying the morale of the republic. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the "nineties" on "loss", masculinity, etc., are moved to the 1970s. Belfast is filmed as part of an Irish "psychological state" supposedly unique and leading to violence. The stupid song of the women in the club - Old Ireland of the green fields .. Blah..blah .. - given symbolic status, ie the poor young fools are fighting for an impossible cause. Garbage is boring, historical, cheap and evil. O'Sullivan made a personal statement on the conflict, which requires serious political analysis.
