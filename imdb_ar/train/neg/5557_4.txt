Well, but does this movie make good? Well, not really, in my opinion. There is not much to recommend. I found it too slow, and a tedious, indeed. It's also largely predictable through and through the number and two of them were fairly predictable, but not too much. I also felt that this movie was wonderful at times, which I did not think would fit this series and personal. He's a good enough actor, but I felt he was playing his character on the top. I think it fits into the tone of the film, which would have been great if I had loved the film. Plus, there were some very bad lines Arnold Vosloo returns to starring, but not much is given to work with him in this film. Personal did not really evolve, as I hope. Well, that's just my opinion, for me, while this film is not deep, it's very bad. Voice of Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
