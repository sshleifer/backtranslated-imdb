For me the only reason to look at this new version is to know how bad and funny it is. There was no doubt about it being funny and bad, because I saw "Fuena Mir" (1968). Do we begin? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Pierre Bezukhov, Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Dunnison - a small fellow lacking the original depth; Robert Dornholm and Brendan Dunesen, Natasha Rostova - Scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia. Robert Durrenhallm and Brendan Dunison, Andre Polkonsky - a good embodiment, like the lean colleague (see above), lacks the depth of the Russian spirit and the "struggle at home"; Robert Durrenhillm and Brendan Dunnison Napoleon - a somewhat ineffectual leader; Robert Durrenhillm and Brendan Donison Amir Polkonsky - English-faced feces; Robert Bezhnhoff and Brendan Donisons Count Bezukhov - a senseless, senseless display ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> Actor moves and the way she looks and speaks and is often horrific. They act like modern citizens of the European Union who wear fancy dress for one day. All of this seems cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and men in the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> It's a good entertainment to check and enjoy. We had a few laughs in our office when we remembered this modern product, which was shown the previous evening on our TV. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think many young people have not seen our film "Voyna i mir" (1968) or have a strange sense of "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality. Do you remember the scene in which Hussar rescues his friend, turns around, shoots, and climbs the bridge? Looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no sense and no craft to produce a better version of the novel, which has been properly displayed in our country once. But I would be happy to see a new Russian version entitled "Gone with the Wind." Hi Filmmakers, Wake up and get involved in it, instead of spoiling our classics. <br /> <br /> Now he's back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, despite the fatal exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Making foreign actors try to pass it on to the Russians (while participating in very dangerous dramas and dramas) is a rude mistake and the directors make this mistake time after time. Of course, it produces a lot of laughter - especially as Clemence Poesy is ridiculously awkward, and her dancing and singing make the Russian viewer think, "This is so absorbing that it's funny!"). <br /> <br /> In order to say something new, I would like to mention the pace of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very incomplete. The narration and scenes do not flow naturally - they are stunning and appear in a modern video. Again, I must remember "Voyna i mir", where the procedure is natural and the narrative is so easy that you can simply sit back and enjoy "go with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought that the battle of Borodino might be great (to rehabilitate many flaws in one way or another), but it turned out not to match the scenes of the war that was filmed in 1968. <br /> <br /> There is something good in this film after all. There. It seems that the actors are trying hard to make everything work. They did not have a chance from the start but they still join the "losers" team. Plus 1 point so reckless. Makes Russian scenes uncomfortable - some silly scenes even though they aim to be hugely powerful and the actors are doing their best. All this raises pity, and sometimes - fits of laughter. <br /> <br /> I'm still impressed by this series is the last part of it. It clearly shows how everyone gets his "salary and taxes". In addition, according to the footage, I thought the film would have an adult sex scene, which would certainly kill the whole project. But, fortunately, did not have such a garbage. It's a big advantage. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter", and even these days, we are here in present Russia, we do not have enough craft to portray them correctly. Should I say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated dramatically? Fortunately, a suitable film was shown during our Soviet era. The American version of the 1950s was fairly justified - we did not have a copy so far. There were mitigating circumstances at the time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (one point is given from the beginning, one point is headed for recklessness, two points are for the last part of the series.
