If you see one day in the 1980s, there is little reason to see it. Authenticity is often not one of the powerful points of the winding cinema, something that this film lacks seriously. There really is not much to be said about pranks, so I'll make it quick. The film was one of 74 films on the DPP Video Nasty list, which was the only reason to see it. The plot follows a handful of children who stayed asleep at Christmas time. Because they are leisurely, someone decides to start picking them up, which leads to one of the stupid mysteries ever seen in a tilted film. The fact that this film was on the Video Nasty list is strange because, despite some wonderful scenes, this film will hardly cause anyone to spoil or spoil it, and the oblique parts of this (Friday, 13, for example) . But then again, there are much less banned movies than the movies (The Witch Who Came from the Sea, for example). In any case, the end of the film is the best thing, as if the audience did not really care about the aggressor at this stage; it was done fairly well. On the whole, this is so bleak and gloomy that even flirting fans will have great success.
