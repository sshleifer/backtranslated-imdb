The most remarkable thing in my mind in this film (unfortunately) is the introduction, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) leads the city. You see a Mercedes passing a winding road through a forest that looks like it's loaded with Redwood trees. she is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> For Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin, well ... Indy is just a Spanish / Latino so you can not pass it. Maybe the Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who do you know? But I can tell you that when you put him in a crowded town with passengers and parents, he stands out as a painful thumb, especially with his accent that breaks out when he gets angry. Yes, I know, a big deal is not it? He is still a good representative. <br /> <br /> The title concerns a serial killer named Jennifer. All victims are blind and distressed. The killer took a gap but suddenly appeared when a blind witness appeared (do not ask), Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person, which surprised me. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing the sergeant. Freddy Ross I was worried. Henriksen has played in some very exotic films, especially recently. I still can not forget it in the blood bath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin movies in a small town of Los Angeles as an investigator. The investigation into the Jennifer murders began after the body parts were found in the local landfill. His brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind and seemed elusive. As well as did the paradox of killing * SPOILER * Freddie, with similarities in the registry and name. I was very confused regarding the logic of how there became eight "Jennifer". The murderer's motive was simply not confused. By reference to the past, this film may be more honest in life by showing a non-skeptic who is capable of killing simply because they have become a little younger over time or have been born animated animations. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich is doing a great job in questioning Garcia! Although it is not legally permissible for any policeman to pressure a harsh person and his whites without going out of the right. As for the end, it is somewhat surprising, but it is highly controversial, like the sergeant. Ross was killed. The killer chooses to walk after his victim on the run, and instead chooses to be ruthless I think. <br /> <br /> There are so many opportunities for him to kill her that she is ridiculous. Will not spoil the end because, despite shaking, it is a good surprise. After that, you will probably say, as she did, "The boy was lucky!" 10/04
