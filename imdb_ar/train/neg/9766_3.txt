Roger Korman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was solely responsible for some of my favorite horror films (such as Edgar Allan Bo's Adaptations of the Red Death and Pit and the Pendulum), as well as some extremely cheap, senseless, "And" are coral goddesses. ") Kurman also made a couple of films that are simply unclassified and simply" impossible to judge correctly. "For example," The Journey "can be described, "Gas-sss" is a doping exploit - in other words, it's a weird film that infects the Hippie culture incredibly. In half the time, you had no idea what was going on, These are the characters that go back and forth across the screen and where the hell this whole thing takes place in. The plot is simple and very effective: The lethal nerve gas is released but unintentionally deadly and immediately destroys all the world's population over the age of 25. This * * The basic premise of the idea of ​​the atmosphere, courageous and disgusting.After the scariest science fiction, but the writer George Armitage and Roger Kurman decided to turn it into a "trilogy" comedy of road films. None of the characters try to prevent their inevitable future death; they have gone out on the streets and found little juvenile crime gangs. "Gas-s-s" is boringly disappointing and tries hard to be a stranger. The whole script seems improvised on the spot and not funny at all. I certainly do not have a cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many fans, so who should I say is not worth your time or money?
