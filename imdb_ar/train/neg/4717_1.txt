And how I made him in production amazes me. The main character is a hateful show not the least laughable. I can not afford personal at all. He's dumb ass with nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon that has appeared over the past ten years, no joke. Both story lines are written and executed. Bad jokes like those in Disney Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not hate this offer anymore, it is terrible and should be canceled. Even a bad theme song. Title, worse. <br /> <br /> It looks as though this presentation by a 15-year-old couple is based on character and they think they are hot things when they are really arrogant and lack creativity and humor. Johnny Test, go away and fast!
