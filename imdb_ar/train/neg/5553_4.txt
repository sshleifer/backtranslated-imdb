This Darkman III was definitely better than the second, but it is still much worse than the original film. What made this better than D2 was the fact that "Bad Guy" had been changed and Durant was not returned again. Moreover, there were actually some hints in personal evolution when it came to the bad guy's family and Darkman himself. This made my heart soft and I gave this flick as much as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
