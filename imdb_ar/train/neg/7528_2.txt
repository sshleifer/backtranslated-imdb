This is worse than the original death game. There is an incoherent hybrid story that leads to the fall of Billy Lowe from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him while we are on our way to follow his younger brother Bobby Lo. So, we do not just begin to clone Bruce Lee, the film kills that person and makes us follow the story thirty minutes after the story. The main reason to watch this is when Bobby Lope fights Asda, who is obviously a man wearing a lion's costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain, who is usually great but his appearance time is very small. See this primarily and the original Death Game because it is part of Bruce Lee's packaged collection. No wonder that it is included with the works of me finished. No one will buy it otherwise.
