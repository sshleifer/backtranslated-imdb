I saw this in the theater when he came out, and yesterday I saw him again on the cable. I was able to recognize this with feelings about the extent of this film's revolution. A whole set of characters are narcissistic introductions. Worst of all, it promotes all the negative stereotypes dating to 20 something, although it is aimed at celebrating people "to find themselves". Finally, the soft players end up, the jerky men make them wonderful, and the reluctant men do their best. The girls are all boys. Only one character ("Wendy") sees and does anything remotely useful to the community, and she relinquishes her long-held virginity in a one-thumbed nightstand, in a beautifully photographed scene, supposed to be romantic. What is really Hollywood's concept of young America: indulgent, detached, indirect, arrogant.
