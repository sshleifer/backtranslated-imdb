I must have picked up a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because in the show of the film last night, the audience had captured their anger from the dialogue that came out (half of it so I'm not kidding). Shot as if the director thought he was approaching some of the bold new territory by presenting the story of gay at an early age, the film uses images inspired by David Lynch through a representation inspired by Vasbender. The performances in this film were so boring and tedious that I thought one actor would end up with a lack of understanding of the text. What's worse is that it's colorful like a ring of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director thinks he may have surrealist claims like Bonwell, Jordowski, etc. But the problem is that all of the directors mentioned above show a level of concrete sensitivity that is sorely lacking here. I've been able to understand the meaning of this film about 10 years ago, but when we have masterpieces such as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin, and Show Me Love, why are you interested in this film stranger? There is nothing new to see here.
