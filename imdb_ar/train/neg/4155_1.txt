Well, I knew this would be a F-back alley film (well below the B-film standards) it entered, so I thought, "Hey man, I can use a good laugh, so let's see some northern objects kill each other." Find what I got in the local Love Game shop. Random lesbian scenes, very little fight, no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one scene in particular I remember (for its absolute emptiness only; I saw a better porn on ABC) is the two main places of characters (I can not remember their impromptu names ... great movie, huh?) Along the way, as most of them did, the driver was tired of driving and stopped: "Let's pull, I'm tired, do you want to take over?" Passengers: "Sure, I can drive the car for a while Time. " (Once pulled, the driver begins to grab the passenger's breasts). Passenger: "What do you do? I do not like it!" The driver: "Everything is okay, everyone does it at some point." Traveler: "Okay." (Continued to take off shirts, sedition, kissing, and tongue performance) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked out, horror movies were not found in the pornographic section of Hollywood Video (unless in S & M, then You go somewhere else) and certainly do not have to be in the main blockbuster videos. Do not get me wrong. I'm definitely not one of those who hate pornographic images, but I only watch it when it's appropriate and I definitely do not want to see it if I'm looking for a movie in the main stores because the person I hired was one of the retailers I named Also if you go and look). <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever, no one should rent it, must be bought only for a general combustion event. If I can give it 0, I'll do it, but I can only give it 10 *.
