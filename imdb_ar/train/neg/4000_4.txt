I enjoyed the American Film, so I hired Chris Smith's first film, which I thought was a documentary too. In the first minute, I saw that it was not, but I did. <br /> <br /> What a dead end. Being a reality in life hardly serves you if you are just looking for passion. I'm already troubled, but would it be appropriate for anyone that 1) absorbs a lot of jobs and 2) mostly salary, minimum wage jobs in the service sector ?? I knew that before I saw the film. This did not provide an examination anyway, while the film struggled to feel "realism" (portable camera, no music, etc.), which barely happens as it does in the "real world". Will the employer be very fond of Randy when he picks up his check, after Randy resigned three days later when the man said he expected to stay 6 months? Or the next day to give up his job (and tighten the machine on which he worked), so that everyone is easy to it? <br /> <br /> A big problem is "Our Hero" (?), Randy. This man is the loser. Not because he is stuck in these jobs, or has a wonderful apartment, or like it. It's dope. He does not even notice or even try these jobs. He has zero character. If I have to hire someone, I will not skip the interview. <br /> <br /> I look forward to what Chris Smith is doing after that, but you guys, amaze me "this important movie" stuff. "American Function" does not work.
