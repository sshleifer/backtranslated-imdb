I saw this movie for the first time and not long on the "TCM" series. The vulgar eye of the beholder was not more than aberus. This little sighter saw the value in this one. I was puzzled by the infinite attraction possessed by Lucy (Lauren Bacall). Granted, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film, her character was more volatile than her attractiveness. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley are likely to ignore Lucy rather than condone it. In Bakal's defense, this film was produced at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and the weight of his deteriorating health may affect her performance. Of course, part of this blurry part of Lucy is to compare it to Marylly in a whore, played by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she is engaged in a sensory dance while her father climbs the stairs tired to a heart attack heartbeat away from the best scene in the film. Malone's performance outweighs the rest, although Jasper Hadley is weary of the disappointing behavior of his two children brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Overall, though, I would say that I am not a Melodrama fan. The cartoonist behavior of the characters makes the story extremely unreasonable for my tails.
