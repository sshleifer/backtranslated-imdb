Lots of Borrower B Something - <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in cinemas every year. Because of this, film studios tend to avoid making larger budget movies this weekend. Every few years, the studio releases a "The Wedding Planner" (2001) to compete with the big game. Super Bowl weekend "The Wedding Date" will try to find success and attract viewers who do not watch the game. <br /> <br /> Of the patients who feel sorry for her, the single woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Ming, TV "Will and Grace") is hired to accompany the male Nick (Dermot Mulroney, "Information about Schmidt") to her role as her boyfriend for a wedding Her sister in London. Her family gave her a hard time not to get married, and her seven-year-old fianc√©, who left her for no reason, was the best man. To make him tease Cat Nick marches around the ex to make him see what is missing. But Nick helps Cat finally realize that she can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The film is borrowed too much from similar wedding films. It's a carbon copy of "Picture Perfect" in 1999 and blends in scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding." The film also contains the theme "Pretty Women" in reverse, and its audience, the director makes a smart reference to that and to other films. <br /> <br /> "Wedding History" contains all the vulgar elements in a typical wedding film. There is the typical Wild Mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and wedding letters that are practically stolen by family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The collapse had finally happened before, but it was something that was not entirely expected. The real reason for dumping Kat comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film during the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "wedding history" is predictable, it can stand alone. Debra Messing, in her first role in leadership, proves that she can be charming and funny. Dermot Maleroni has a wonderful chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his conversation was trivial and unrealistic. He is able to make the most of what he has given, and is able to save his personality. <br /> <br /> By using many smart puns (often sexual), the movie is actually funny. Although the film contains basic elements that everyone can enjoy. Feel good story, humor make it the best history film released long ago.
