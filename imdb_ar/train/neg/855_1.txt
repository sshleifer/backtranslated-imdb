Not the best movies you'll see these days. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and expected to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and environment were good, but there was no story here. There was not a single moment of fear. I expected it to be a horror film, but there was no horror or horror. The only scene in which I felt scared was the change of chapter that shows "Wednesday". There are a lot of fragments in the film. Most things are left unexplained and not linked to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that are being shown. It may be a good film to see in the 1980s, but not for the 21st century.
