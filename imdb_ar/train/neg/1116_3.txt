This film seems to have been a training exercise for the Coppola family. He does not seem to know whether "A" or "B" is Western. I mean, the hero Hopallong Cassidy is called for God. William Boyd must be in his grave. <br /> <br /> All Western clich√©s "B" are here. The old-fashioned son with the shiny teeth in the white hat with the confident c'mon "C'mon Thunder", the black bearded villain, the heroine in distress, the cattle in trouble, the cowardly leader, the evil top, etc. <br /> <br /> Representation, with a few exceptions, is from Yakima Canutt Acting Acting School. Chris Lebert (from?) As a hero and Louis Schwebert (who?) Also seems to have been the villain could have been more at home in a quick blow to the 30 Poor Row. In addition to veteran actors Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Cleo Gulger and Will Hutchins help little, but have not been given enough to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of Martin Schein / Robert Karadin framing sequences? Do we believe that Shen's character was a ghost? What is the purpose of black gloves? It was not logical. <br /> <br /> Being a great lover of Westerners of all kinds, I have tried hard to find some of the qualities that are reproduced in this film. The filming was good, and the settings looked very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, the other characters look original. <br /> <br /> If the producers will revive Hopalong Cassidy, they may have thought of filming it when it was originally written - a hand planted with shrapnel with a sliver on his shoulder, the kind of part Marvin had in it. <br /> <br /> What can I say but .. on Thunder, on a great colleague.
