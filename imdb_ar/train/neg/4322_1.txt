Keep reading and taking notes - you can save 88 minutes of your life (that was it!). <br /> <br /> Too bleak, this film will start to produce (I think) a small modern American city Christmas legend in Cabra style. If it fails .... completely and completely fails. I was trying to think of something good around him and I can not. Let me mention some salient points ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, but spend eternity as migrant workers at Santa's factory. Angels are actually former shepherds sitting in trees. Santa can bring people from the dead (if you send him a nice message). <br /> <br /> The plot will not spoil it for you, but there must be some light in the movies if it only contradicts the darkness but there is not. Even filming is dark - the snow appears at the end of the freezer, and looks everywhere cool, moist and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you guess, the movie has a happy ending (schmaltzy). What a relief!
