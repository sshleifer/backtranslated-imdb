I could not give this movie a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Tony Collett. The film is likely to be exciting, and there are some minor annoying elements that tend to have a psychological state on which the film could have focused slightly. Robin Williams plays the role of Gabriel Nun, Digai, who tells nighttime stories and has personal problems: his lover comes out, and Gabriel faces what appears to be a case of storytellers. One day, he receives and reads a story written by a fourteen-year-old boy named Beth Boland (Rory Kolkin). Pitt tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his adoptive mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Tony Collett). Gabriel is intrigued and begins a friendship with Beth, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility of a house in Poland. I will not go into details because I do not want to spoil the film, but I will tell you this: it is quite predictable. The ambiance is great for a good story and shows from Robin Williams and Tony Collett, who I thought was the main character in the film. Colette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Her ability to take advantage of the psyche and personality of the characters she visualized is very strange and I hope to see her win the Academy Award (hell, I think she might succeed in getting a better actress gesture helping this person if the script is a bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but it is a predictable film. If you are interested in knowing the end of the film and its deviations, look for the film or I will rent another movie called "Hide and Ask".
