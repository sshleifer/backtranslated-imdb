This unambiguous mini operetta with a prototype of Eddie Macdonald in the Valentino scenario is so bad that it becomes an exercise in endurance five minutes later. It's ridiculous from the start, as this brief opens two military men discussing the lack of masculinity of an officer. In less than a minute, he was full of Magrocco, where he lived a double life like the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that prefers singing instead of fighting. <br /> <br /> Alexandre Gray and Bernice Clare have great opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a good voice in this place, but the acting is so, the random scenes are totally unprepared, you'll feel they're doing things as they progress. <br /> <br /> These two verses were part of a larger theatrical production that lists six books. With more room for ridicule and confusion, the show may have some entertainment values, but this fast-paced game is more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature to show.
