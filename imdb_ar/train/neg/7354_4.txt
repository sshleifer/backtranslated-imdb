As a complement to the hammer hammer, I was afraid of the time when I would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the film that followed, "Holiday on the bus." I saw The The Buses and thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Was filled with all the terrible comedy that plagued British television screens in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that parts of this film are truly sacrificing. I do not know if that's because I was now familiar with the characters and I enjoyed some positions and knew how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I have not sworn in any way in this triangular phrase, does he say that the phrase "I'll bring you butler". <br /> <br /> The three films are compared with an early hammer, Dick Barton, since the second film is the best (although this is probably the only way to compare it). <br /> <br /> The only people who want to watch this movie are most likely to admire the TV series, who will undoubtedly enjoy this, and Hammer complements me. For the Kemalists, I would say that this film is not so bad and I can certainly think of the worst Hummer comedy.
