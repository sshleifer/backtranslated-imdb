This film revolves around a young world that creates an outlet that revitalizes the dead. He used it for the first time on his brother when he was shot dead in a car. His brother then attacks other members of the gang. In some scenes, zombies see walking too slowly and in other scenes running too fast which is meaningless. Acting is mediocre but the story does not help the film. The make-up consists of blood on the face of the zombie. Budget for this movie I'm sure it was very limited. I think the film would have been better if the story had been original and had a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie flick do not see this one.
