No plot, crappy acting, and useless gore .... <br /> <br /> Is this supposed to be a horror film? There is no fear, or suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then do. Some of the marines were kinda in the desert for some strange reason, and crazy people were hunted by these mutant monsters from the first film, which was good and should have been left in it. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money, the use of senseless violence, just like the consequences of "Saw". They know no matter how useless this plot is, and the more people they can add, the more people will see it. I miss suspicious horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do a lot, much better.
