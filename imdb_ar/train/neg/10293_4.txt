My wife and I watched a movie every night without any distractions, most of them artistic films that required reflection. I have a lot of patience for slow films. My wife has twice as much attention as I do. All that is said - this film is only empty and boring! Did not go anywhere. Never flourished. I started pretty strong with a promising plot ... then you bake the cookies ... and go to Spain ... they are a conglomerate, staring .... Uneven, full of holes, false beginnings and dead endings. We have received many of its extended sequences and are just staring into space. The artificial depth was implicit when played with mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It is more like a game of beautiful fire chick that pretends to be deep or artistic. You never know or understand Morphorn at all. About halfway through you just do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the ground lines evolve. Do not waste your time in this. I am shocked to a high degree.
