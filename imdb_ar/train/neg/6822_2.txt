Drones, ethnic drumming, bad mixing tubes, singing children. The most revered "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist film and one bad one. What really kills is an incoherent sequence. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc, etc. No transitions, no visual explanation Why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no thoughts expressed in the pictures. Just a bunch of footage from the Third World with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said. Walk to infinity as if it had a profound meaning. If these young people want to make a music video for the third world, all they have to do is go a few hundred miles south, where the best parts of Koya and the films were filmed in Mexico. This would have created a much better environment for "life in transition". <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was a botched tourist itinerary covering the hemisphere and highly filtered filters. The only thing I recommend in this film is that it does not absorb as much as my accounts. <br /> <br /> RstJ
