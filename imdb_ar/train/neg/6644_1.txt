Yes it is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to undress actors and publicly show their property. Pintilie is the Naked Emperor - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It is time for someone to tell the truth. This crook is a snooping, naughty man locked in the body of an old man. The abundance of bare scenes has no technical legitimacy at all. It's a 100% optical aberration: he gets his kicks by making the actors take off the storm and look at their commandments. If he does so to the public, he may be sad! Did you know that, in the "Niki Ardelean" group, he was embarrassed by the poor Coca Bloss, saying, "Oh, Coca, how do I want to be you?" She is a great lady, very respectable and very sensitive, and she feels indescribably shy - for trivial satisfaction! As an alarming alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Roman masses, many people are still very foolish to declare such outrageous visual works of art! Will anyone ever have the decency to reveal the truth of everything?
