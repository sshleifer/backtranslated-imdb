This film is made in a non-standard and non-original waste. I love romantic comedy sometimes. Watch one good like eating ice cream for dinner. It is not something you will do all the time, but the experience is so enjoyable that you can ignore your wisdom. This movie made me think about how dumb I was to sit around all the time. All about it I screamed made in cheap. In fact they seem to have been exposed to the film at some points and washed. It boasts cheesy CGI and lame groups, too. <br /> <br /> The writing was clunky. I know you can usually anticipate some plot problems in the spiral comedy, but you usually do not really care because you laugh. This movie is so strange that you sit there already and wonder about the unexpected series of coincidences and incredible behavior at all. The events in the film were put only to move the characters from one scene to another or to make the show. Sure, that's how all the movies work, but you should not notice that. poky. This is the term I should use. <br /> <br /> There was almost no one in the movie was loved. I did not care who ended up, so long as they all stayed in hell away from me, and I did not have to listen to them talking about him anymore. Why do you want the only truly wonderful character in the film, a character Paul Rudd, to have anything to do with the obsessed with the full and exhilarating control played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all the people involved have chosen the least expensive solution to any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to wander around (and shower) with a woman attracted to her? The best moment you were satisfied with was to have a happy ending to the same destroyer where she met Rod's annoying and equally annoying sister? Lake Belle and Eva Longoria are very attractive women. They may find something better to appear on the road.
