The second film in the boxset. Originally entitled Bloodsuckers, this film was pretty average. It's a bit boring in some parts, but there are some good effects, but it's not wonderful. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. Vampires captured the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation), who also owns his own spacecraft and is led by Churchill, who was captured by the vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team formed by Quintana (played by Natassia Malthe), the rising officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman The Roman played by Aaron Pearl of the wrong accuser.) V-SAN later meets with the vampire leader Moko, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He has no plans to live in peace with humans, because he is determined to dominate the world. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be back in a DVD player any time soon.
