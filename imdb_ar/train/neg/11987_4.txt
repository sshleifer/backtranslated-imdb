In my class lit up we just finished a book, Hatchit, this movie does not look like a book. (1) Brian did not eat worms in the book. (2) did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother was cheating on his father in a station wagon and not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man who is betrayed by the mother has no black hair, he has blond hair. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) the 13-year-old can not punch his fist through a window in one punch. <br /> <br /> To represent, the child who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the scene is impressive, although I strongly doubt that the director has read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you do not read Hatchit's book, by Gary Poulson, but if you do, start a letter of complaint to the manager.
