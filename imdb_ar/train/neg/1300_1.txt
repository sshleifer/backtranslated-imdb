This movie should never be. Frankly, I must admit that before I saw her I had some serious doubts. The director is not a wonderful actress, although she has made many films in the Netherlands, and the young woman who took her main part is a television personality with a steady smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other major part I recently saw in Bride Flight, although the film is better, did not convince me that. To start the story, I have not read the narrative on which it is based, but the scenario on which the film is based is something that may have been done with children who had a birthday party on a Sunday afternoon, not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. There was something really annoying was the overly propaganda dialogues, and most of the time he was talking loudly. My greetings go to the photographer, at least try to make something out of them. It is unfortunate that the film was edited poorly, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
