Good movies can not only rely on a beautiful garden and a hilltop. I was surprised to see her and won two awards. Extremely exaggerated. I first saw this kind of film from China, but also amazingly visually with something really catchy I say, well, over 10 years ago I'm sure there are still more upcoming movies. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
