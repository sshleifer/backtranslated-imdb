"Three of the treasure hunters in the West Indies are looking for a hidden treasure, and the temptation of gold is an increase in tension as men approach the treasure site." Deep-sea divers hope to pursue gold, but they find that greed and hatred lead to killing, . "Manfish" is the name of their boat, not a beast. The skeleton that gives Captain John Brumfield muscles (as Branigan) half of the treasure map is very good. Old salt Victor Jory (as professor) provides the other half of the map. The first colleague plays Lun Chani Junior (like Swede) stupid, and protects Tessa Prendergast erotic (like Allita) rum (not very well, obviously). Editorial problems and serious continuity distort the image, which may have been somewhat up. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
