This film is probably inspired by Godd's Masculin, and I urge you to see this film instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements: (1) realistic representation (2) admiration, improperly good image. Apart from that, the most amazing thing about me is the endless stream of kindness. Lena Neiman must be the most disturbing actress in the world. She is very stupid and with all the nudity in this film, ... she is unattractive. Compared to Godard, thought was replaced by stupidity. Without going into this subject, I would like to say that this follows the difference in ideals between the French and Swedish communities. <br /> <br /> A film in its time and place. 10/02.
