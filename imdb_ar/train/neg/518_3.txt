Bella Lugosi is not the kind of writer in this wonderful twelve-part adventure, where he plays the role of Frank Chandler / Chandaw magician, where he enjoys the role of a representative of the powers of white magic against the forces of Black, while showing a strong fighting skill successfully grooming a young Egyptian princess, And wrecked in yacht equipment, with a sea cover. Chandler / Chandou is involved in an ongoing series of festivals that indicate the rescue of his fianc√©, Princess Naji (Maria Alba) and other clergymen in Obsti, who are coveting with the blood of Najji to revive a timid old princess on the mysterious island of Limoria . Director Ray Taylor, an old hand in such entertainment keeps events moving quickly, but frequent scenes and footage, many of which can be found in the preparation of the island of Skull Island for the previous year by KING KONG, and in the harbor port of SON OF KONG, reduces the original procedure to less than 60 minutes of serial playback length of more than two and a half hours, if viewed in one session, becomes unmanageable for most viewers, unless there is thinner.
