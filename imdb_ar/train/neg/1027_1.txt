Usually, I have much better things related to my time of writing reviews, but I was very disappointed with this film so much that I spent an hour recording in IMDb just to get rid of my chest. <br /> <br /> You thought a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a critical bet ... well, this was a terrible film. It is impossible to "suspend kufr"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake did not allow me to do so. <br /> <br /> Timberlake must stick to music, its scary performance - not as an actor, not a character. You can not blame Justine: the film also boasts a terrible plot and a time-consuming release; it's definitely "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I must wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean certainly Morgan read the text actually before participating. Did not you see how poor it was? What could then motivate him to play the role? Capital? Of course acting acting is sometimes about who you see instead of developing really good work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a wonderful actor. Gets a screen time much larger than Freeman or Spacey in this movie, and really struggles to reconcile with the bad script. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the audience says, "What the hell is here, do you expect me to believe this crap?" <br /> <br /> In short, apart from Justin's superbly poorly executed lineup - very disappointing.
