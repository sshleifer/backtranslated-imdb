When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcasting in the United States, I was thrilled. Then I had the misfortune to see something darn. I love the books of M. C. Beaton about the wonderful Scottish Constantinople. The characters in the book are amusing and well written. It is clear that the forces that are responsible for this cattle have never read a Betune book. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find that the entire presentation is loud. Actors seem to feel that their lines must scream and yell at each other. If you love the wonderful Hamish Macbeth for M. C. Beaton do not waste your time on this trash.
