My mind blows how I got this movie. I watched it while I was at home writing emails and answering the phone - I just saw it because I hope the "revenge" part is good. Needless to say, vengeance and coercive distortions were not worth the e-mail messages that were seen during it. In fact, I'm not sure what happened in the end. The worst representation was the re-enactment scenarios in the presentation of "FBI files" - by far, the worst re-enactment (may be really only "arrest and trial" when the legislation was reintroduced) I did not even know that the leading man was in the third eye game for the blind I looked at the movie here on IMDb, but it is clear why I have not produced any movies since. I hope to be a good singer.
