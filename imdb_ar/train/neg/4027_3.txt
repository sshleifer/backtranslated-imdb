This should be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of accuracy, complexity and full political correctness make it truly childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like this, and good films show complex characters with dilemmas, dilemmas, and so on. However, the most I hate in this film is the father of Paula's friend. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaving heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average-looking father (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something). Thank you brother. I'll suggest you to get the Nobel Prize for Literature.
