This movie is just awesome. It's boring, low quality, actors are the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, he's overweight and seems to be from the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> All the characters are absent at the weekend to meet friends, but no one is really a friend! The couple did not see the "main" man for more than 5 years and even then they were not really friends. The "history" of the main man knows him only from work and from there a girl lives in a bar. Tell me now that you risk losing your weekend job in your cabin with people who are not even real friends to you. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the film! <br /> <br /> Do not waste even one minute of your time in this lemon. I made home movies more terrifying than this! <br /> <br />
