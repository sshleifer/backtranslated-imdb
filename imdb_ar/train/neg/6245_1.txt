The only thing that proves the "disturbing fact" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "non-united" experts do not face any challenge because the response to their unusual assertions is generally under real science. This is mostly false science people. The largest source of greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide - is people, we breathe it and unless you are ready to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there is nothing to do. We have heard how the world will end as a result of man for more than 50 years. Fool publishing a timeline for Doomsday When the time passes, nothing happens. An "annoying fact" is just another way for a troubled faction of American society to overcome their pipe. <br /> <br /> As for the departure of Al because of the tobacco business because of the death of his sister because of cancer, this is very load. Al can not run his ranch better than running the country. He was losing money in the process because he did not care about agriculture when he could earn more dollars in speaking tours. The only global warming that does not challenge is the hot air produced by this gas bag!
