This movie is awesome. I saw him the other day with my cousin Jay Jay. He said it was fine, but I think it RULEZZZ! I mean, it's very cold. Ted V. Mikels is a brave and very intelligent. He made a completely different film from Hollywood's horrible films, such as Matrix, STOP, or My Mom Shoot. It could have been better, though. I love ninja and pirates. I also love those big telltale worn by the funny guy. I think it's the coolest man since he became a man of Dominis Pizza. Not only does this film look just great, like those unfocused films that my father made when I was six years old. But he tells a complex story that contains dozens of seemingly unrelated characters, but they all meet at the end. It's a genius how this web is woven to make everything meet. I wish I had Ted in. But he needs more foreigners. Pirates.
