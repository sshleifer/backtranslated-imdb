I love John Saxon for anything in it. The time he takes the camera even though he's running a movie that should have been titled "Please do not watch this movie called Zombie Death House." The $ 1,000 Shock Insurance Certificate is a valuable way for Fred Olin Rai to spend you $ 14 on a landfill that was filmed by a major cheese legend in the 1970s. Ray being the front man at RetroMedia. Ray by the way makes the Charles Band look more hot than the plaster ceilings on the Ford Falcon. Just bad bad now, all of them - and boring besides. It is wonderful that Ray digs these old things, and in some cases the public domain is like the rest of the video roaming in dollars but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" is confusingly overlapping to add ownership and interest by L) the only way to do this service The TRIPE is disclosed in the dollar market for collector of antiques and fans of Saxon !!! If you want to see a real Saxon, choose Black Christmas or Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
