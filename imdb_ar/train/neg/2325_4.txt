The first scanners may not be a great movie, but at least it was originally. There is no such grandma in this film. Representation is worse, in my opinion, the story is slower and nothing special. I was not like dialogue either. Special effects are not better than they were originally. This film is inferior to the first all-round. The only thing that is different about it is that it is loud and sometimes chaotic. But it does not make a good film. If they did something better with the story and made it interesting, it was a good film. I could not really get everything without being redirected quickly. Movie, not much more. Despite all that, there are worse movies. In a generous mood, I will give Scanners 2 4/10.
