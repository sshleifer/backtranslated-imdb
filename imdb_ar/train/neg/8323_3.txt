From the beginning, this film had some drawbacks. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is the wealthy young tycoon who inherited his father's enormous wealth and strength, struggling to fill his father's shoes and shrink the mother's aprons (mother and CEO) that are still too narrow. He also has the problem of heart disease and waiting in oblivion, a record of organ donors. There are also secondary stories back to the first instinct of ignoring most of them and becoming important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Lines story is not emotional, but not bad enough to destroy the film. The only real "Hey vey!" The moment was the name of Lena Olin. An arrogant woman called Lilith ... hidden! <br /> <br /> Surgical sights are not controlled at all. I appreciate it, people who find scary surgery scenes may not. The dread of waking up during anesthesia was good at first. You see a passionate torment while Christensen screams from the inside through the thorax and rib distributer. Then comes the moment of irony from the trailers, as he is one of the lucky few who wake up during anesthesia, and is lucky to help him learn that his surgical team is planning to kill him. <br /> <br /> A great twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film into the plot and his memories of the little signs were there but he, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> Two other developments in the end relate to his relationship with his mother. One of them is an impressive gesture by Ulin, which comes modest due to weak writing. The other is a mystery about the past of the family that seemed to have been addressed to a great extent and to no avail. <br /> <br /> An awareness drama of well-executed anesthesia is lost in the drama of the poorly written plot. There is a final attempt to bring it back to its flat position, taking the whole film with it.
