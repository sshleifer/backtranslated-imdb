I've always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I was browsing the search for a movie to rent it, attention caught my attention. It was the worst $ 4.50 I've ever spent in my life and I want to recoup my money! Please do not waste your money on this! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The entire film was incredibly boring and I found myself rolling a lot and did not watch it all the time. I'm just fed up with it. The representation was terrible, the effects were awful, everything was very bad and tasty. It was added to be a very bad and boring film and a waste of time and money. I hope they will someday make a good film about Sasquatch, but even then, I will have to sit in the countless cheap men like this to find a real masterpiece.
