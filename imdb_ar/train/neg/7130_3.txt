This film should have been named "Need For Speed: The Movie". For those who have not played games, the Need For Speed ​​game mostly revolves around hot cars, beautiful women and almost any scheme. This is true for Redline. The only thing about this movie was that the A-level was cars. Representation seemed forced and written, and the hypothesis was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I have watched this film only to see how bad his condition is, and although it was so bad, it may be worse. At least he was amused. I wish they had shown Eddie Griffin smashing Enzo somewhere in the film. All in all, do not pay for it, do not go far to see you, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it distracts attention.
