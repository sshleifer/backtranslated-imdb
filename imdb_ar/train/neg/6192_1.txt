The great euphoria of Robert Carmichael is a bad film in every way. The scenario, the gloomy pace, the lack of depth in any personality, the senseless sub-plots, the terrible representation, the unnecessary rush make it all the worst movies I have ever seen. I did not find anything that was loving, fun, or intellectually stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I imagine that filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark, with mood lighting, long-term silence and mysterious classical music. If so, they have completely failed. I was bored with it, and I hope I never see it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
