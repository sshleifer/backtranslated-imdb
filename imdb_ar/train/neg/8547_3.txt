This was a fairly creepy film. I found music to be effective for this purpose. The photos taken by Mario from the village were also disturbing. However, I had three problems with this film. One is that the lighting was very dark, so it was sometimes difficult to determine what was going on, but that was probably my version. The second is that the beginning is not well illustrated and I'm still not sure what is going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but it is clear that some people understand it. Of course there are also the usual problems faced by people who do stupid things, and male lead is the seventies. All in all, watching but not close to being a favorite.
