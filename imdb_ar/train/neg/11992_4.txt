I had never read the novel by Gary Paulson, Hatchit, which was adapted "Cry in the Wild", so I can not make any comparisons with the book. However, I would say that as a solo film, adaptation or adaptation, it was a backward adventure that offered no major explanation for its few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of a "Cry in the Wild" as a less-climber climber, a climber in his teens (Quincy, California was the only place where he was filmed?) "Cast Away." Jared Rochton, Brian Robson, a 13-year-old boy, was traveling on a small plane to visit his father, until the plane crashed over some abandoned mountainous terrain, leaving the child stranded for a long time and forced to defend himself. <br /> <br /> There are three basic parts In the film, it is clear that the introduction of ten or fifteen minutes of characters, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film (which actually consumes the whole film "There's nothing really spectacular about this film, and there's nothing spectacular but a lot of pretty Yukon's beautiful film works." Nothing puts you on the edge of the abyss, there are no real confrontations (except You may feel bored briefly as time passes as we witness Brian dealing with his position through the first primitive means, then the most improved means (using tools, etc.) To stay. It is like the normal time that passes if you are already stuck in this position, and this is much more than that. In other words, they did not put anything on Paulson's words when they translated them into visual media. <br /> <br /> Of course, the third part of the film is to save it. <br /> <br /> There is a sub-plot that constantly seeks to make itself known during this time, however. Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a critical rocky relationship between them. However, for the most part, it is explained only briefly, intermittently, minimal dialogue memories that seem to be the background story of a music video. In any minute, the singer of the Jefferson Space Tournament must chime at the beginning of singing "Sarah". Unlike what the viewer can deduce from the effects or guess the need to fill gaps in the narrative, we get a very backward story that may have been necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and establish contact with the characters, whether or not had anything to do with Bryan's survival adventure in part The third of the film. These are the flaws in the novel that through the viewer to the staggering as he struggles to see what these people are doing on the screen, and for me, it ended up screaming on TV to say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> Certainly, for me it was not a good adventure story. But for the fans of Jared Rushton, it has been one of the last few films he made. So, watch it purely nostalgia, if there is nothing else.
