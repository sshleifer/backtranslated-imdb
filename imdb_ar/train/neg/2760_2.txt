I knew that it was not good between me and the wars we have seen since the moment we met. Her first title was lazy. D war. Like writing a dragon was a lot for them. Also ... you really can not be blatant with your address unless your blue monkey. The Blue Monkey can do whatever he wants in hell. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the mad progress of the story. Here's the movie, the dreamy reporter man who talks about the big snake tracks, back to the time he and my father wandered while the competition in the store should have been in gremlins and the dreamer's reporter found the kids a glowing box. Maintaining an old shop reveals many terrible facts. That the supposed evil snake boorake had been deceived by his chance to be a god. He tells the child that he is an incarnate warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles his lover is re-embodying him and giving him a piece of unwanted jewelry. The Keep store also reveals that, despite its obvious whiteness, it is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, a dreamy reporter remembers this completely and starts acting half-crazy as he tries to find this random girl. Follow cgi hijinks and in the last ten minutes my mind melts from my nose. why? Keep reading, dear reader if you have balls. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, the lover who has been embodied, has memories of her own. I have the advantage of having the best Asian friend in the scene where the horror begins and making a set of posters with Asian characters on it telling me that the maker of this film has no idea what they are doing. She is a Korean legend and has been embodied by a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later that night, she began to hurt her dragon and called the police because she looked like she was suffering from a heart attack. Look, in this mixed mad world, they seem to be dealing with heart attacks differently because the next time we see them, they are locked up in their room with a guard outside and a nurse claiming to be crazy. I have a new phobia now, which is that if I'm in trouble ever the first responders will assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my cruel lover Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Junior (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a rude black friend. In the previous scenes, Murad was killed near the villa Buraki divinity, slipped into a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. Look, people were afraid to go out after 9/11, but we must all stress that coffee and pastries deserved to risk our lives. Working as usual, the giant snake will not stop me from getting caffeine. If I stay indoors and fear my life, the terrorists and the roller coaster will win. <br /> <br /> After giving me a satisfactory tan in the helicopter battle, my cruel darling Dwar treats me to a scene full of mix and vinegar to end all this. Bauraki has his own fort and his right under Los Angeles I think. They do not really say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sara got out of a car accident, killing fewer men and when they wake up, Little Dragon Palace. Some dialog later retarded a good snake god dragon pops out of nowhere and wrestles snakes / make love whatever. I'm not joking a good snake out of nowhere. You may think I turn it off disproportionately, I do not mention this thing in the film, then suddenly ... there! A few seconds later, the good dragon became a dragon god, set fire to the Burke, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with the Dragon God, the dreamer reporter who stayed in the middle of the name credits anywhere ... Thank God <br /> <br /> Now our relationship Rocky was also in good time. There was a man who looked like tearing turtles and spoke just like a tuskan passenger of Star Wars. I'll call him Tuscan Chipping. He can do what he wants whenever he wants to, and he will never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a place where that was not useful. You can go in your dreams when nothing is useful, and you can set fire to ten random soldiers but it does not matter when it comes. He was also allergic to touching those junk jewelry. I like the fact that it collided with a car twice in the same scene and made it amazing noise on the tuskan. <br /> <br /> The actors were mostly fantastic ... if they were wonderful in some way awful. Jason Bohr, who I thought was gorgeous at Roswell, slowly discovered that he could only act in one way, that is Buzzer, Spacey and Patrick Dempsey's "Nest." <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this dirty bitch is her main actor, Buraki. This giant snake acted his heart. I dare say that he was better at playing the role of the evil god of CGI, and then John Barrymore was playing the role of Richard III or Hamlet. There was passion in every scene, where the thunder stole from his deadly support team. When eating an elephant I felt that no one in the past or present or future will eat an elephant with the same feeling. He was more than a representative, he was a natural force and put his heart and soul in every second of this cursed project. Yes Damn, the favorite actor in this film was the CGI snake. I have balls that admit it, do not I? <br /> <br /> I hope that Bauraki will get more work and not cast a shadow, that Jason Bohr finds a bunch of other emotion and then a stare, and this I do not have to watch the Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, the war is over. I want to return CDs and let's be friends
