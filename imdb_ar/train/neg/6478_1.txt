I'll say it again: this movie was completely lame. The kids will definitely like them, but the adults ... are questionable. The whole thing was a rework of the original, which is expected, given their exploration of the full concept in the first film, but they still have to rewrite the entire film in full? I mean, everything is back from Little Mermaid. The worst part of it is Morgana, "the crazy sister of Ursula," which emerges from nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ironic because Triton exists with his magical trident, so why did not Triton do anything about it because the plot requires him to do something. , But it would not be a failed attempt to raise more money from Little Mermaid, obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell.
