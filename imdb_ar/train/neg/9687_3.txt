This is a confusing film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is deteriorating by a group of men and women who can only be described with a host of defects and abnormalities. <br /> <br /> Greenaway admits he was inspired by Fellini's "8 1/2", but Vielini is a giant of world cinema, Greenway is not. <br /> <br /> He has no touchiness in the maestro nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with clarity versatility. <br /> <br /> It's a hummingbird, the movie is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer should be guided in the movie except that the written notifications remain only on the screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read By the public leading to their mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> For women, only two observers, Palmera, played by Walker Walker and Giaconda can be described by Natasha Amal. Clay the rest with the usual. Both women and men retreat from harsh reality to dim shadows of imagination. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Greenway wants to make it clear that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are inhibited because they offer their services for money. Relationships between men and women are deteriorating in a business deal. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy, happiness or love in the movie, and there are already many very unpleasant scenes: <br /> <br /> The incest relationship proposal between father and son, and Philippe Sture Emmental played on Respectively by John Standard and Matthew Delamer. The harsh neglect of both men carried by Giaconda carries their child, he is actually pregnant twice, the first fetus being aborted and the second time, sent away to a destination chosen by men from the flight book. Both men have sex with a woman with no legs, (half a woman in the title). The brutality exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortens. Father and son share the women between them. Women who enjoy sexual beating. The father sleeps with the body of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes were sexually transmitted, and only hinted at. <br /> <br /> The deterioration of women's character is that there can be no wonder that the film was booed when it was first shown at Cannes. The strangest thing is that the actors in the film line up to defend him and show again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will deceive themselves to be exploited by men. <br /> <br /> Granaway's style is a tonnage, a triumph of style on substance, a film as an art accompanied by a renunciation of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenway attempts to achieve the supremacy of surrealism, but only succeeds in showing the vanity of human relations.
