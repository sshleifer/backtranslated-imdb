Ronald Reagan and a handful of American soldiers in the North Korean POW camp. They are being tortured ... We learn that the North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that the Americans' cheeks grow very slowly during the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress them, but I finally burst out laughing in this film. This was the scene in which Mr. Reagan told the Communists that he wanted to be on their side. Then ask for a bottle of brandy. After that, he acts with a cold stone sting, taking a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get the sulfur to treat Mr Martin's remains. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is stupid as it comes. So, the wine takes off the guard while Reagan goes to get something from a drawer, next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes were supposed to contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them shiver enough to reveal they're empty. Oh gotta laugh! I think a "prisoner of war" will appeal mainly to family and friends who have worked on it - otherwise, it is wasted. <br /> <br /> War prisoner (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
