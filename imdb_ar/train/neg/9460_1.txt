This movie made me upset! When I think of the cat in the hat. Im thinking of the cat in the hat books. As you know, one of the few years ago that parents read to their children. Well, although this movie would be a lot like this! But much to my surprise was not like books! Insted is more like a young humor film. In one part, the cat talks to a gardening tool (shovel) talking to it like a shovel (adult humor). His car label I am in spite of all that was a little taste for a film for kids. Under the classification you will find: mild humor and some mild double entry. I think this means briefly the humor of adults. I hope to return to this film! Wal-Mart said they would not do so because the film was opened. If you are thinking of buying this I suggest that maybe rent before buying.
