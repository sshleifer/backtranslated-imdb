What begins as a somewhat clever euphoria about a suspiciously suspicious security surveillance company that turns, almost instantaneously, into an unfamiliar and completely unfamiliar murder mystery. David Arquette and Stanley Tucci are trying to make this train a wreck, but some things are not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What, for example, what makes a generation suddenly turn from a sweet motherhood into a drunken joke at my Tommy home? Why does Heinrich, although it is recognized that Selizib wants to destroy his life-saving business, steal his clients and perhaps kill them? Why did Tommy think he seemed to think that Heinrich could be a murderer (almost entirely dependent on a dream), and even if that was reasonable, why not go to the police? Why did the generation of the alarm not activate when I arrived at the house, especially after an amateur scold stopped him? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot (and I use the term, very very loose) until it unfolds. It may be blurred if it results in little comedy. But everything from describing Howie to his rape until the date of misidentification by the forensic doctor to Gale, and even the "joke" about Gale and Howie still dead, is more tasteless and compassionate than anything else. <br /> <br /> Check the box that indicates that my comments contain "spoilers", but there is nothing else I or someone else can do to spoil this thing that is already strewn into the high sky.
