The only reason why I do not give this film less than 3 stars is that it does not quite fit with a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The greatest crime in this film is the fact that it is boring to melt the head terribly and British unforgivable. The premise of this film seems promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they went was totally uninterested. It was more of a film about research funding and arches than a laser display. The actors were wooden, unemotional and distant. It was also a love relationship between the two worlds - which was not interesting. I never knew what gravity was between them because chemistry did not exist. I also did not really understand why the main man with the dark face decided to slay everyone he met. Now at least I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before I cut off their research grants, otherwise they will be shaken, and brutally killed by the dumb hand signals.
