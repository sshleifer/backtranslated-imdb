Watch this You've mainly noticed placements. DHL, Aquawhite Stripes, Rockstar and more. It is the placement of one product after another. It is quite clear how this film got funding. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is laughable. No Dick should get a job because he plays the same lame personality. "Story" is just the background of this very long ad. I can not believe this film until it was considered a theatrical version. The longer you watch this movie, the more embarrassing you are to all participants. The only simple saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachel Lee Cook, who get almost no time as Jessica's. I'm embarrassed I saw everything. I would recommend avoiding this one.
