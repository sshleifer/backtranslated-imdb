Well - when the public appearance of Jason Miller (who seems more battered than the fourth exorcist) is the highest point in the picture, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a little country, a little rock and roll: mix two drunkards with money that attracts their child everywhere with a marsh-dry mummy (have you discovered that one person is still - dried in a quagmire?) in the basement , Christopher and Ken with a bad dye job, and a little girl might be an interesting figure if they developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - somewhat - that they will return to visit relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> The problem: There are many important past memories that I must assume is that her mother is killed in a car bombing (I think). This is never associated with anything. <br /> <br /> The problem: What do we need grandmother? Now, novelty can be interesting. You speak gaelic, Celtic, or anything. Maybe you can make something of it. The best they can do is that they usually have tobacco. That's it. <br /> <br /> The problem: They made a smart figure as a husband. Is he writing (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to his trust fund) or does he write (after all, he has a good hair story and pretty clothes)? Drink, hesitate. He is not a bad man. not good. But not loved. Why did they do nothing with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: An old friend appears. The pair knocks it. He returned to demolish the husband. (It seems very stupid, but at least that character has motivation.) Now she's addicted to alcohol, she's addicted to alcohol; he may have married her for her grandmother's money locked in the bedroom. Blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her a charming mummy (do you follow this?) Who may come to life. In fact, you know they will come to life, swell music. A small girl lives in the house and takes tea to Grandma (opens the door to do so) and provides novelty to cigarettes. Periodically, Grandma comes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose a child at home, and lose their room later. Uncle gets his ring in the basement. The leading lady has bleeding nose. The husband drinks. They both drink. In the face of all this, the terrible truth that was mentioned in the first exaggerated voice is - omigod - an abortion when the lead lady was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these threads hanging down the plug, no one was able to get a story on the screen. There is no bridge between the positions, do not go out of the moderate turmoil to terrible horror, just slow long scenes do not go anywhere; no one, really, cares about it - and they had places to go with this side - the innocent child in charge of drunkenness, She was locked up as a monster, but no, her biggest mistake was smoking. She has wonderful hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no plot. Just random (unpredictable) violence in a dark library, with a rain flow, and an audio track that saves us. You need more than some drunkards, Christopher and Kevin to produce a movie. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice view, good wardrobe. At least the photographer knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. The poor I am.
