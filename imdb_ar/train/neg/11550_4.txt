I knew I would watch a film with a low budget, but I expected more from Alex Cox. The behavior of the two main men was terrible, especially the white man. The girl should have won the Oscar for both. This movie was full of what I thought would be jokes for filmmakers and some other jokes that I already understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these loud moments I would have given this film 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who made all classics in the 1980s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were two questions I had after the movie ended. Why did the Mexican man go to the other man's house at first? What did his daughter say that he expelled 100 people from his last job? Why was she breaking her own purposes when she was angry with him? I think I should have gone to the Q & A after the film, but I did not want to wake up at 10 am.
