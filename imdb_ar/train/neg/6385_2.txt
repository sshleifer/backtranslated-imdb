Many of Gayniggers are summed up from outer space by their name. Spanning only 27 minutes, he describes a spaceship of gay blacks that comes to earth to free men from women. While I see little importance for the plot, it is really illogical. Granted, supposed to be a comedy / spoof on society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so I succeeded there. <br /> <br /> The special effects are awesome. When the spacecraft floats above the Earth, you can see the stars rising for no apparent reason. Asteroids that appear at first seem fake, the equipment on board the vessel is illogical, there are many spelling errors in the text, the actors are not hooded, the characters are disabled; in general, everything does not take itself very seriously. If you skip all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it will be easy to access and easy to watch to the end. Some parts are hilarious. But overall, the only thing you remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. <br /> <br /> Seeing that it's a short film with funny aspects, it's not the worst thing to see. But it is illogical and carries little long-term value. I can not really recommend it; if you see it, do it for a unique concept and not for quality.
