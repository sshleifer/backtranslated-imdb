In a word ... abysmal. I give her a single star for hippie sex scenes and women eye candy, otherwise forget it. Korman's worst efforts, nothing. Ben Firin should have been permanently named the stricken cast. I can not believe that this will now be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another badminton product. I woke up sick in the bed this morning with a cold, and decided to watch a movie to cheer me together, and scan the digital channels ... The assumption seemed interesting enough because I loved watching B-movie movies, Hippie culture and rebellious teen clicks. It seemed familiar in some way, and with Ben Fuerin in the team, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... It was a terrible start to a day. <br /> <br /> Just after watching it, I know now why my intimacy has broken into my newly awakened mental rest. I remembered the sights of this film when I was 14 years old (I am 45 years old). I returned in the early 70s of the 20th century in Sombrero, a local theater that no longer exists ... The whole theater laughed hysterically and even bowed loudly. How bad this film looked. Actress: Scary, Story: Horrible, Cinematography: Almost Horrible, Music: Awful, Sound: Awful, Directed: A Prank. If you choose to watch this after warning, remember ... "I told you so." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... Feel "gas" after watching this rotten movie - or maybe you should be taken to the "gas" room to waste your mind away. I've watched the homemade Super 8 movies that put this film in shame. Definitely a new addition to my top ten movies at all ... it's present (er, down) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
