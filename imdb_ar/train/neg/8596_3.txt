This is basically a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a brilliant and enjoyable film with several truly personal roles. None of the investigators see anything of this. <br /> <br /> A obsessed obsession with the video store that a mysterious, twisted woman has discovered is good but has not been fully or adequately explored, thanks to the poor text and misunderstanding of the prospects, not to mention the lack of any real storytelling style. I mean that this film is centered around movies, but it is in itself unbelievably unbelievable! This is a big drawback there. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters because the text and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them real or sympathetic to any real medium. So, the film becomes just a series of episodes that include two people who look good and are not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, something else: for a romantic comedy? Not funny. Romance is not terribly romantic, as well. <br /> <br /> So avoid this. Even at the time it runs for 90 minutes, it is not worth sitting ...
