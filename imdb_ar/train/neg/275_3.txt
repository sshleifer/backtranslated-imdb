It is unbelievable for me to comment that this film is not a preacher. Not only are they aware of persecution, they are also absurd, highly reductive, highly entrenched and hunger-prone. When you see it, you feel like an 8-year-old child punishing "I will not be fascinated" on the blackboard 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was manufactured during the height of WW2, and it was supposed to be a courageous condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he caused, (which one will applaud with all my heart) and I am sure he has captured the mood of the day accurately. But it is presented in an immature, overly clear, heavy hammer, which largely fails as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are from Paul Lucas, who brings fidelity and intensity to his heroic role as a quiet hero; and Lucille Watson as a rich and amusing grandmother grandmother who comes slowly to realize how dangerous the world has become. Although their unfounded education has exposed them to all sorts of difficulties, children ridiculed them as small, well-behaved snippets. They do not even resemble humans remotely. The House of Davis, a wonderful actress, is one of the nobles of dimensions she felt out every time she was on the screen. Every word, each gesture aimed at expressing the extent of support and understanding of marriage and the great reason for which it is fighting, that it must be wired to receive a painful electric shock if dared. Any hint of suspicion or shading allowed the surface to be photographed. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this is a very important film, not a very good film.
