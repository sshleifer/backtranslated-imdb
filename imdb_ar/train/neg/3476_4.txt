I loved it, I really did. Please do not think I'm a fool but I have to admit I enjoyed this movie. I expected it to be crap, nonsense, but sometimes, it's good to relax and watch a weird movie you do not need to focus on too much does it? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morale, and there was no meaning, but that did not matter because I saw him just for fun, and I had entertainment all the time. Movies like this are the reason that Ben Stillers (sorry for "There's Something About Mary") and Vince Fons (however you can spell his last name, I could not be scrutinized) have jobs. I do not drive the car because I do not own a car, blockbuster video, or even options, and rented a bunch of these films that were neglected in the bathroom. And stay in one night to watch it. Good day to you reader. PS If you do not say that this comment helped you, I do not love you, and if I say that he helped you then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
