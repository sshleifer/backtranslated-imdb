Yikes did this movie a blow. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I thought this could not be so bad because it contains Christopher Wokeen, sorry. He must have done this because he was bored and needed money. The characters were supposed to be Irish but no one had an Irish accent. I'm trying hard to find something nice about it, I can only walken did a good job of a wooden character. Look for something to read or see the discovery, and you never see this movie.
