Like most festivals, Hamilton offers to watch an interesting film all the little ideas and implementation. Although impressive because of its low budget, the film stumbles on its final development and becomes frighteningly long during its extraction and clear conclusion. The film revolves around a family of violent pariahs trying to survive the death of a parent. They kidnap people and shed blood from them and feed something closed in their graves. There are some nice nice offers from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest only. The film never feels real or very disturbing to the issue. But in the first half of this year, a mixture of humor and dark is strangely mixed up, an astonishing accomplishment. The next half will not be entirely successful because it has become oblivious to unrealistic twists and turns in a ridiculous and ironic conclusion that turns the entire film into complete nonsense. It is shameful although there is no doubt that some talents have been involved in this production, and despite the deep flaws it is still original and creative. Too bad that when it comes to delivery, it fails completely on every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
