It was 9:30 pm last night in my friend's camping trailer and we were horrified to see South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park is broadcast at 10:30 pm and we decided to waste time watching the show that is now being broadcast by Pride's father. I'll start by saying I've only seen episodes. The first time I saw it, I found it unusual and raw for nothing, so I thought "Holy sh * t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons." But yesterday, I tried to give my great father a second chance. I find it a complete part of the Simpsons game, just replacing the yellow human characters with black instead. <br /> <br /> The second thing is I wonder why I got a TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons too trite, and the only real vulgarity in this show is some homosexuality jokes (uncommon). The Simpsons are also more violent (special Halloween shows) and raw. I also heard that the creator of the series had taken out Shrek 2 too, I had news of him: Shrek 2 was better off and I think he stayed so much in the family theme. However, I must admit that the father of pride made me smile (until he burst out laughing once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not mind proud father. I do not hate it, but I do not like too. I've seen a better way than the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
