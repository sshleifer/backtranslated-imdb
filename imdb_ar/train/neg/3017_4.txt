Now I had the best intentions when watching this. I love some of the work of Tony Scott, as a friend told me it was a wonderful movie, although I heard other people from other people. But this was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying hard. It was all too much. Allow me in detail. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was overvalued, not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, Christopher and Alken, but at the time of their show he could not save the film. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that jumped in their originality, but somehow felt like someone else had written it. A certain melody was used about 4 times, which already started a bug after the second time. I strongly believe not to use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> Also, the edit has already finished with this edit, because the cut rate is fairly high. Oh, and repeated repetition of some of the lines of Kira looked simply cowardly after hearing for the second, third, fourth and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, in my opinion is that if you want to see a high-precision click and do rather funny, and do not care about all of the above, you may wish. <br /> <br /> (In a side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
