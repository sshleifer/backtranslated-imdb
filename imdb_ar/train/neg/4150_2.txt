Oh really really it is. I've seen films I did not like more, for whatever reason, but I did not watch a film that fails in every aspect of filmmaking. He even failed to make films, in a way that Hercules is said to do in New York. It's not the movie I love so much, but it's the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that strikes your attention. I have never seen a film worse than pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films that represent a better location than this. It is truly appalling. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera action is amateur. Editing is meaningless. I assume they can not buy the right sound equipment, which means that every scene in the car (and a lot of them) drives them to drive at about three miles an hour, and each scene is located outside with the same wooden floor (and many of them) Which has increased his admiration for bad pornographic feelings. <br /> <br /> The plot is illogical, as many have pointed out. I will defend the vampires as they walk in broad daylight through the fact that despite being circulated by Nosferatu, this was not essentially a fundamental part of the vampire legends. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the myths of vampires, the author has read Carmella clearly, or at least looks at vampire lovers. I am not sure how I feel about this, impressed by the fact that this is a very bad film, at least has some aspirations for a Gothic novel I am very fond of; At least, the "General" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> He gets two stars, just because I can not bring myself to vote for one star for a film that contains, or at least purported to be, both vampires and zombies in it. By the way, I saw Lifeforce (another vampire and zombie movie) on the same day, and although it's a fairly flawed film, it actually comes out with a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not a bad film, it's good, or very bad, it's fun anyway, so it's drunk. It's just chaos, and nobody deserves to be seen.
