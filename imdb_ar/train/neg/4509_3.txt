"Diary of an Army" is a visually stunning melodrama that looks more like a camp, dragging a satire queen more than anything about real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film continues defensively in insisting that the army is neither prostitutes nor concubines, it is an embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But unlike the dance, the rest of the film turns into "Pretty Baby" in Storyville, or at least Vashti and Esther in the Purim story, where all women's efforts in art and craftsmanship revolve around entertainment for the elderly, drunk with poor men. Japanese culture may be prostitution, not just American decisions after World War II. <br /> <br /> The English speaking strain may be stressful, but Ziyi Zhang shows little of the great glow described in "Flying Daggers House (Shi Mian Mai Fu)" and "Hero (Ying Cheung)." Michelle Yuh sometimes gets glimpses of her certain performance in "Crouching Tiger, The Hidden Dragon (Long Huge Long)." Only Li Gong shows any real life. Other than that, I kept imagining Charles Ludlam in different roles, or even Silvan Murphy, as in the Kabuki Theater, especially as the plot dragged on in the cats' fight after the cats fought. <br /> <br /> The supposed love story has zero chemistry, mostly because of age differences, and I feel sorry for Ken Watanabe and hope that Hollywood's paycheck will be compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious "chairman". I remember more feelings in "Jenny's Picture," where the little girl grows up to Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Coton. <br /> <br /> We see a brief overview of reality when the army is formed with women organized as photojournalism tourist attractions, and where Zhang Ziyi permanent young people live years of war in the process of very colorful kimono die. The end does not have much sense of returning to normal. <br /> <br /> The result includes many traditional tunes cut, with Yo Yo Ma and cello by Yitchack Pearlman instead of traditional instruments, which are beautiful to listen to along with beautiful cinematic photography, as long as one completely ignores plot and harsh representation. <br /> <br /> As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai films dealt with this story, which was perhaps more formal, but more emotional.
