Unfortunately, I no longer remember the book, but I remember being fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film is typical German production of low quality. It does not draw my attention - although the story itself is good, it is heavily shaded. In the midst of misery, there are very simplistic and exaggerated personalities - no nuances in their performance. Even well-known German actors Joachim Fuschberger and Eddie Arst can not save this bad outlook. However, there is hope ... I was told that the films that follow this film are getting better and better. In conclusion, I must say that this film is not worth the movie screen but it may be enough for the afternoon.
