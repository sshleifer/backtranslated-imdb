I was very disappointed by this film. I was expecting more of the female crime film Thelma and Louise. Instead, women prisoners who escaped from this group had no sense of allegiance to one another. It was a very vulgar pack of hyenas, beating each other, crossing each other, even committing rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being stabbed by thieves, who are stuck together to plan to escape and find the hidden treasure, the women who have been escaping are selfish and wicked, and trust each other for a long time. These women were not free. We just ended up being a bunch of loose guns, unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like the 1970s movies of crime, skip this bomb and watch The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
