I watched this film last night with anticipation, but in fact I was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> Except for the movie "The Combo", I thought the acting was bad and the narration was limited. It appeared as a drama "made for television". <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was very fabricated. The whole set of hammer in the context at first (yes, we came to be Britain in the eighties - you can stop now) was exhausting and presented a one-sided view of what was the case in Britain in the eighties - Poverty War borders with kings, Margaret Thatcher , But nothing between them? There was, in fact, a middle class that existed at that time - just ordinary working people, with decent wages and mortgages. The Falkland sections seem to have been added randomly at the end, for a "dramatic effect", I suppose. <br /> <br /> The series of events felt disjointed, as characters moved one movement to another without seeing how their mind could change very quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between "Shawn" and "Smell" was the game of football. I could not even look through the narrow scene. I find it very hard to believe that she was attracted to a boy who was not only younger but also looked younger. I know there was only four years between them, but four years is not anything once you are 20, but there is a big difference between teenagers! In my experience, this type of difference occurs in the teen only when the girl is younger, because the girls mature much faster, and are more along the wave of boys a few years ago. Sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for the shock value. <br /> <br /> The ending was somewhat surprising, and again, it was contrived. If the flag-throwing incident was supposed to be an icon, it was rather short in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that British films only care about the upper classes or poverty. Do not get me, I love Trainspotting, and four concerts have their charm, but can not we get anything different? Why are our movies always suspended on the caste system? I was born in 1973, so it was not very different in age from "Shawn" in 1983. I grew up in a single-parent family in a city council building in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were quite different from those filmed in the film - so I do not remember that racism is a problem (although I do not say it does not exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I felt that this film lacked substance, and I felt totally bored and disrespectful all the time.
