The really sad thing is that this was supposed to be the highest budget "Halestorm Entertainment" should work with. All those involved should be fined because of the rubbish because all the celluloid they waste is good for filling the garbage. Not only is the terrible writing and the awful jokes, but the camera work and amateur film quality at best. Soundtracks appear to have been created on some laptop computers. The worst part of it all is that I've already sat it all. I only think because I could not believe I actually paid for a ticket and that the theater I was watching had already approved the "movie" show.
