Well, thank you very much Disney for destroying the wonderful memories you used in my favorite film. I was five years old when the original film came out, and it was one of the first films I remember seeing. Now, I am 16 years old, and I have enough feeling in Almazhouchi, I decided to rent this film. Thus, I managed to poison all my memories of the original film with this unfortunate excuse for a film. This film takes everything that has made the original granulation a waste, down to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show it to everyone in the ocean ... The Way! After the musical number ends, within minutes, the magician shows Morgana and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up on the trident. Thus, he gives up without even fighting. Eric stands there, though Ariel discovers how to use the sword and rescue Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody must not go near the sea until Murgana is arrested. <br /> <br /> Well, uh, nothing really matters. Eric is a total wuss. He really can not do anything. Ariel kind of does something. Melody runs screw things. Plus, animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics end with collisions with backgrounds. One chance is lost ever for personal development. Bite the songs. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I am sure that even young children will feel bored of their skulls by this, because nothing exciting happened remotely. They will not want to sing songs. If you can get a copy of it, throw it in the ocean and hope no one will find it at all. Start.
