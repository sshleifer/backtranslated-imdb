This kind of plot already has a lot of potential, but it was slaughtered here. Frankly, I felt the cheese element at first, but I thought it would improve after the ugly birth. Whoa, I was wrong! A crazy scientist makes a beast, wants to show off his old friends before he kills them, but of course they run away. After that, it's really bad. I had to calculate the times when the rubber shark mask came out from behind some leaves, but I probably lost their number. <br /> <br /> Move down to the wet leg of blood to show us how the shark finds people. I hate to feed on every aspect of a horror film. <br /> <br /> Oh, after being killed by a mutilated shark man and walking around in a jungle island, there is nothing more fun than just a middle movie. An old man reads Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is where you will find yourself rooted in the monster ... if you can bear this bad excuse for a flick.
