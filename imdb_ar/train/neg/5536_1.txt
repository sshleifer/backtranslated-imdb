Revolution Zombies has no recovery features. I'm fed up with people who argue that this is not bad, and that the effects should be packed more than a punch in 1936. I guess that's not true: it's not like the sharp rise of IQ in the last seven decades. The average audience in 1936 may have been bored of the trash as the average audience was today. why? All you have to do is watch the first viewer, count the pause between the things that happen, the terrible timing of the cutoff, and the montage that appears to have two extra seconds on each shot to output the run time. Be aware of unnecessary dialogue: "I'll make some tea / go outside / read my book now." "You are?" "Yes me." This type of exchange occurs several times. I usually like it, being a fan of bad movies, but watching actors who are not born with their own vulgar and boring lines, and the urge to laugh at the film slowly disappears. This type of washer, boiling at boiling time, is much worse than the lively and imaginative informants like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim that this "best" of those most interesting films have an idea of ​​entertainment backwards. This movie is not bad, meaning that the jaw is hanging in astonishment: it is bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom. It is much worse.
