Indeed, the 1980s trend of disgusting violence began to disguise as a "horror film." I was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and I was so disgusted then as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where to start. To see, setup: you can return people to live if they die with violent death. So this weak and funny assumption is the excuse of the butcher in terrible ways, because, well, this is necessary to bring them back to life! This may be successful if you play on top to laugh in black on a re-animation or something. But no, I played straight. There is a whole family terrified in a cart that is caught, one of the few scenes at least where their death is off the screen. However, everything else on the screen. In fact, there is a scene in which a young girl walking on foot is beaten and killed by the inhabitants of the Zumbian town, who are all filming and smiling with several cameras. Then, there is a close-up of her face, where directors show a love - and time consuming - in the photography that separates time, that the face of the batsman carved on a skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. It was, of course, done by the dizzy Jack Albertson as the killer behind it all. He likes to walk around in an ambulance / listener playing old Tommy Dorsey tunes, I think it's supposed to be nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even Sharif is undead and the doctor is kindly offered to repair his rotting hands. It is not clear why Sharif did not go out with the other residents of the town who kill children with joy and cut their faces, and stick needles in the eyes of victims of burns, and so on. <br /> <br /> I wonder, I really wonder, what people see in Geek's presentation like this to give him any sort of rating at all. This is not scary, the twisting is laughable, and it is generally satisfactory. It's not good enough to 'see it if you dare' or to enjoy a level where you might see a bad HG Lewis movie. It is just a garbage basket from God, made for people who are driven by this useless futility, made by people who grumble about getting paid. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Albertson was involved.
