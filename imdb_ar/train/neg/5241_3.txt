Tell me the fact that I am a bit amazed to see all this positive review by many people, and that is the main reason why I actually decide to watch this film. Having seen him, I was really disappointed and this comes from someone who likes this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> I'm quite surprised by this film - it's like a child's film with nudity for no reason at all, all involving small children who swear and share. I am not at all righteous at all, but this has already gone too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Summary: The two-person story was sent to Big Brother because of their reckless behavior. There they met with one of the children with the mania and the other man is a maniac in the Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> Just a name that is not really related to the story at all. They are not role models and do nothing but spend their time for what they did. The story is highly predictable (though expected) and lame humor. We have not seen the same characters (Mc Lovin) in many other films (such as Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and fell asleep almost. <br /> <br /> Well, I had a good choice after all his about the script. The representation is as good as expected when watching this type of film. What direction do you expect? This is the same guy who brought us hot summer wet, this film also suck. But somehow he always managed to get a star to attract his terrible film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I felt totally uncomfortable but totally wasteful of time. The naked scenes seem to be the best part of the film. I can not really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> FEATURES: Elizabeth Bank? Two naked scenes. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not funny, horrible story, nudity and children do not mingle together. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
