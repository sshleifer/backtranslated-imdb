From the beginning, you know how this film will end. It's full of clich√©s that your typical NRA member does not like even in this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just because William Benton acted. I can not believe that people voted 6+ for this movie. They are biased towards a "certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. They are not born well. They are born with a clean slate. It is society, parents and education that makes them who they are. If they take a wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly will not be the US sanctions regime that puts them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like Plague. I bet that you have better things to do with your time than wasting it on this folly. <br /> <br />
