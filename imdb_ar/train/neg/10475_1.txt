I am the wife of a young shepherd and we took some young people to see this film. Then we spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not get it and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept that extends across the three major religions of the world (Bible Code, Bible Code, Code in the Qur'an), which is so dubious that it is laughable. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe that we check our brains at the door.
