This film really tries hard. If you're going to make a horror movie, give it at least a reason to believe the viewer's suspension. <br /> <br /> Waiting and waiting for the film you expect some great explanations but you do not. Instead, try to be a very smart end and do not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Where is he actually going? And more importantly what the hell was going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how did they relate to anything? Just another science fiction horror is weak. I like the fake reviews on IMDb saying how great it is through press releases related to the movie protrusion (either that or people have low prospects). Not worth every two hours at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the film is better than fragile, but at least this gave you a thought about why things happened and for a final result. This does not just happen with a lot of stuffing to make everything feel scared. This movie is almost as low as when calling strange. God who was very lame. <br /> <br /> Great advice, if it works on terror, make it a validation of the thinking and explain to the viewer what is going on, so they have a link in your story. Because if there is no thinking or believing, there is no constant comment on anything and can not be scary. Lack of respect for staff or crew because they did a good job. It's just weak writing.
