Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Probably a sword .... <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good Banner .. <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor in Bikini ..... <br /> <br /> There is no good reason for not Watch this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ Did not these people make JBJ ... <br /> Why? Why did you forget it? <br /> <br /> Despite all the criticism, the first half of the film is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some conspiracies and I feel a kind of frenzy blending with the excitement I feel when you see movies Richie Guy like LOCK STOCK and SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Karina Kapoor is impressed by a very thin model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar because he can only be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying but kind of funny, I've forgotten most of the time you can not understand. <br /> <br /> Side sword on Khiladi Min .. Again. <br /> <br /> There is casual laughter and some chuckle s laughs, and a few cry of horror during the love story of Kareena-Saif (Karina in the Rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> But most of this text promises more than service providers ..... What makes the second half unbearable ... <br /> < > There was almost a cheering when the interval came not only because wet kareena because of what people thought was the things that would come. <br /> <br /> Instead, the limit of torture that is difficult to put everywhere has been dealt with. <br /> <br /> A sword suddenly looks like a comedian ... <br /> <br /> Loudly, Kareena searches for my appetite, realizing that the last second floor is now empty and her face is looking forward to rhythm for Her body (only girls can notice it and make other men notice that the second floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and Janicek collide with your nerves. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only person who carries some craziness but is so unbearable after a while. <br /> <br /> Everything you are exposed to is ridiculous after the other. <br /> <br /> Why? !! What??!!! when?!!! Where?!!! What I wanted was to deserve this ... <br /> <br /> The collective moments before the audience in the second half, which was normal even without the film surrounding it, happened to the audience. <br /> <br /> The trauma can not be alleviated anymore .... <br /> <br /> Conclusion. <br /> <br /> This MOVIE STARTS AS A BUZZ may begin to feel like it turns to end but slowly moves in the direction of the head and quickly turns into a complete attack on the migrin area. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, in the first half. <br /> <br /> +/- What, when, and how, from which many confusion. (You need a book to fill this). <br /> <br /> + s, the entire second half (need many pages to fill this). <br /> <br /> Total 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid 1s and 2s also does not seem extreme but do not make mistakes in this movie can not be accessed no matter how fit the first half is).
