A handful of non-professional actors are intimidated by the prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal animations to stop motion, but how will you miss this margin when the animation is replaced by the rest of the film with production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this film is hijacked halfway by these doofuses hiring a comic boat, who suddenly become leading characters; but again you must recognize that watching them try to be funny better than evading after a sheriff. Only at the end one is eaten and the other leaves sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - this is not fun!
