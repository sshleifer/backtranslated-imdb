The only thing that prevented me from vomiting after watching this film is the fact that these are just actors and not a strange show that usually appears on the TV show. This is also the main reason TV fans do not like the film, but not the only reason. This movie contains an entertainment value such as getting the root channel. He is getting close to the depths of making bad films, and getting worse. I will not waste your time describing this film in more detail; suffice to say that I pity the poor camera people who had to suffer by watching this C ** for the first time.
