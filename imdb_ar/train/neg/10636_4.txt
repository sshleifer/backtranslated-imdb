I was really looking forward to this show due to the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes have dissipated! Again, we have led us to believe that the KGB is a group of incompetent bums who have no idea what they are doing. At some point, there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB customers can not handle a single CIA client. I am weary of these biased and biased images of the spy game that went on during the Cold War. I find it funny that the United States is unable to produce substantive films about its participation in World War II and beyond. Just like the pitiful U-571, where we were told to believe that the US got the Enigma machine, again, completely wrong. <br /> <br /> According to her classification, the company was filmed very well and represented. Languages ​​are also very well realized. Alfred Molina offers great performances like Keaton (the conflict between them is very good). I really wanted to like this show, and I'm sure I'll end up watching the other two, but I really hope that the US productions stop trying to portray their spies, soldiers and other business people intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on a planet. Progresses in age quickly and seriously detracts from the reasonableness of what can be 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
