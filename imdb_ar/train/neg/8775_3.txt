LOC could have been a good film about how to fight the Kargil War; it had the positions, budget and skill of "Saving Ryan's Soldier" in India or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, this image appears in the movie Masala. Even scenes of war were terribly executed, using the same hill in all scenes of their battle, and spending unnecessary time in the unusual conversation. Instead of trying to attract the Indian audience, it was better to have the best film in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spend time on the hardcore point of view (like "Tora"), Tora, Tora. Until then, I would like to see some re-editing this film, including only the relevant parts; it would make the film more watchable.
