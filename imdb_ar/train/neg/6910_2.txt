I have never seen this film but I can tell you one thing about its production. While the DJ radio comedy / old themes in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked if I would write and record a little bit that they were falling into the soundtrack as sounds emitted from the TV (the TV screen itself would never appear). I certainly said, I wrote a parody of the science fiction monsters of the 1950s, collected some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. Since they were on air at that time, I put a long song, joined us in Mike's production room and we cut the sound in one step. She laughed, then returned to her program while mixing the sound effects. We never did that if we knew that the "Woodchipper massacre" would be like Turkey, but again, we did not get any money for our efforts, either! Gary Thero
