<br /> <br /> The worst. Movie. since when. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of filming this new version (besides turning it into a 90-minute movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * run * ?? I think the director has never seen the original "dead" films, which show very hard-core creatures moving towards prey. <br /> <br /> How, exactly, do survivors know which boat in the marina belongs to Steve recently left? <br /> <br /> 1/10
