The story is like the story of "ET": it is spinning out of the earth and trying to get home. During his stay on our planet, he will create friendly bonds with humans. <br /> <br /> But, unlike ET, who is drowning in drama, comedy and poetry, this film is just fun. It really is Dysney's pure production: his primary audience is the children and the film is more visible than in the letter. <br /> <br /> So, you'll find some funny scenes (the first sight of the city, a stray roaster "cosmic") and the casting is tested, with special references to "Doc", rejuvenating the character of "Mac Fly", to Hurley , Which seems open to automatic cynicism. /> Ice on the cake: The title is recorded by Danny Elfman, and like all the other great composers, you recognize his "voice" before he is credited.
