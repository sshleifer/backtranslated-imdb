It was really that bad. On an equal footing with the television series "Dirty Dozen" (which was unprecedented) and starred by Ben Murphy and starred at about the same time (also cheaply in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I felt embarrassed for the cast members in this film - and Tali Savalas in particular. Waaaaaay was very big and painstaking in turn (paying 70 when he made this trash), the reference that draws parallels with Thely the Greek in this, and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" sums up so much. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have referred to a number of ridiculous worlds contained in this crime against celluloid, so I will not repeat them here. But I will add that I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned the small-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his oversized big head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that the wreckage of a movie train has a rating of up to 4.7 here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> For me, it's "1" right in all areas. If you want a good example of why the Franchise franchise is a bad idea (especially 20 years after the original) - look no further than The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission. Awesome - avoid !!!!
