USA. The land of freedom, hope and dreams. This is the country that has sought since its independence to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world, for the benefit of all mankind. However, there are times when one can only hope that the Americans will stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This "movie" (and I use this word with some reservations) raises these feelings with extreme purity. Follow the hell vision of these Calvin adventures, a terrible jewel thieves created by tying the head of Marlon and Ian to the hull on a dwarf body that rises. After inadvertently throwing the diamonds into Vanessa's handbag, a professional woman who refuses to have children, Calvin realizes that in order to recover diamonds she must embody them. So, like any ordinary man, Calvin himself is two years old and stops himself at the doorstep of the poor woman, discovered by Darrell, his wife's husband in Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Darryl is conveniently placed because of Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the "child" has a full range of teeth, a stubble, a tattoo, a knife scar, and a sexual drive for a 16-year-old. Old. Even the most ridiculous thing is that Vanessa does not see the past as Calvin's clothes for children and does not really try to breastfeed the little pervert. This miserable assault on the human spirit tries, and fails, to find humor in rape, biology, sexual assault, and sexual abuse of children, in an unfair attempt to transform itself into a piece of "family entertainment" driven by the Vian brothers and an abhorrent amount of sentiment and morality Defective. <br /> <br /> The brothers are trying to rehabilitate Freud for their robber thief by revealing that he "had a bad father". The repeated beating of Darrell in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the relationship between the father and the beloved son he and Darrell always wanted. As if this were not silly enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that selfishness is indulging in her successful career, and instead she has to spend her life playing the role of a small woman living at home. , Which spends her time alternating pressure on children and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Weyans mixed up the witty and twisted humor with a clich√© feeling that hit many of Hollywood's modern works. In addition, they are settlers of the current generation of black comedians who have the responsibility of transforming the African-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow in itself indulging in naughty jokes and blunt sex kisses. By rights, you must prevent these two people from capturing anything until the camera looks remotely back. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current technical and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this month of next month they will no doubt have filmed two episodes and reaped millions of dollars from brilliant promotion deals.
