Hi. I'm Paul Radek, like the WTAF Channel Attack Panic, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Allow me to tell you about this inspiring film that contributed to Adam Sandler's cinematic life, but was soon numbered. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard is about an ambitious comedy played by Sandler, who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought. Sandler faces children who love World History Part 1 and Rebound. The children were supposed to be engaged, but in fact, they were executed by Sawtooth, a cannibal known to the world. Adam Sandler's performance was poor in Going Overboard, but he was better off in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. The man, Drew Barrymore was a hot chick. Spanglish Red Hot, Game Going Overboard is not ugly Dooley! End of file.
