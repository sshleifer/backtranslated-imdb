I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I was very disappointed with my friends and the entire audience. The film was not so bad, it was good. He was as lifeless as a snake bite victim. Samal looked for. Jackson was surprisingly tired during most of the effects of the lame snake. I was reminded of a SciFi Cheesy movie, but the cheese was not funny or even harsh. Everything seemed mild, flat and frank. I was shocked to say that I think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP realizes that they are part of the game and works with it, but what the film fails to start is a text that contains any suspense concerns. It's the worst sort of lame movie: it's hopeless.
