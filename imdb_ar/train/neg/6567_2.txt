I went to this movie hoping for the best. I like musicals in general. Both Dick Powell and Lucille Paul did a good job with their roles; however, the book gave them a boring dialogue. He gave no real interest in the two. Suddenly there was. I did not think much about music; the best part was the excerpt we heard about Spike Jones with The Faces Face. The only complete figure who has had little wonderful musical comedy; tame the beautiful things, even with the monkey. The comic plays of Bert Laar were endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts you enjoyed: Lucille Ball was more enjoyable, and there was a good group of players who deserved more time on the screen.
