Really an amazing stack of door! <br /> <br /> A predictable, slow-motion movie, the destruction of the soul, mind-numbing, which seems to move his wrists with a breastbread knife looks good, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The high-level dialogue, every scene that takes at least twice as much as necessary, and the intricate details of how the profession collapses or the rise of the profession is just too bleak and secular for words have ended. Music will be good if you do not have to sit in the movie, but in fact, the three good songs are not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie I prayed for God's narcissism or someone shooting at me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, again.
