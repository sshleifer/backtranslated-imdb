I saw this movie once, and I thought it was fine. Then my friends at work said, "See it again, it's better." So I did. To my surprise, it was worse the second time! There is a limit to the number of words, so I will bring the ball here. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the bombing were very stupid. Why on earth is anyone waiting to trigger the explosion? - There are no characters here remotely loved. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> - The last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single bullet, and a huge fire can not be extinguished by shooting. Small Fire Extinguisher ... Have you seen the above 3/10 movie viewers already ??? - The camera is very fragile, and I can hardly say what is going on. This opening scene with the robot was slow to put it, and the rest of the film was not much better. <br /> <br /> Sniper sight. The McManus brothers (from the "Boondock Saints") had their eyes roll, he was so stupid. First, why did the man plant his gun where one person fired? Moreover, why would spend a lot of time cleaning lead, recharging, target and not getting shot, when there was a lot of mess going around it? -SAS Jogging Types Instead of Staying and Answering ?????? Huh ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean to be gay, but frankly, this was a very ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> - Too long for his own sake, but too short for the amount of stuff in it. Bigelow seems to think more work, the better. It seems to be wrong - the film is full of extra traffic scenes thrown there to distract you from the lack of a central conspiracy. I know the guards are longer than 163 minutes, but at least they did not pull the film. This film, on the other hand, still feels it longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is Rainer, who was satisfactory at best. But prefer yourself, just skip this, and do not give in to the hype.
