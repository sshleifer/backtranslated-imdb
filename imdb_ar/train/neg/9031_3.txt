Payback is a game that is played in this drama and is retracted from the revenge plot through the silly story line that paves the way for the fireworks that come later. Why is a man with the wife of the trophy involved with the ruthless mob leader in the gangs' palace with suspicious followers everywhere? Why does the unpleasant wife encourage the attention of a very strange person and expect him to carry it with him and leave her husband and boredom behind him to live happily with his new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, had to expect a reaction from the cuckold's husband who gives the film an excuse to indulge in nonsense and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he certainly deserved, and Madeline Stowe is the tragic character that suffers greatly and is stuck to her charming prince. Sto is fine but her Spanish accent does not work. The veil of the best quality players is good, especially that Miguel Ferrer, John Legzamo and Sally Kirkland are fascinated by the rock star.
