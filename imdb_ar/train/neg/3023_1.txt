It is rare to encounter a terrible film, this is disturbing and disturbing. It is without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it is not blurry and confusing about the happy editing, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a tough ass bad bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a child and this "painful" event left her stunned emotionally, and hated everyone. When the dialogue is not clichehed or ordinary, it is full of funny lines such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At one point, the reward hunters tied a man at the back of their bus with a tattooed number on his arm. Because of a confusing phone call, instead of folding his cover up and just reading the number, they hit his arm with a gun. At another point, the reward fishermen take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the Mafia and threaten to detonate the bomb unless the Mafia allows them to leave !? Obviously not going to the meeting was very easy. <br /> <br /> Kira Knightley is unconvincing and horribly nasty. Micky Rourke has managed to salvage some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the previous Tony Scott movies, being a true romantic one, but all I was thinking about was the suffering of this leadership is that it must be made by a complete idiot.
