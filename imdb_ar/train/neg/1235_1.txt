I was really looking forward to seeing the Planet of the Apes, but it was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great, but that's the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark and Burg do not act, he is only in the film, looks stupid. Other actors are also not very good. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing is the story. It's totally silly! For example: monkeys lie on the ground, but humans do not attack them, no, wait until they come back again! This is just one example of the stupid story, but it will take a long time to tell them all.
