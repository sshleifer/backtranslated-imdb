I saw a mask in the 1980s and is currently on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember that I thought it was fairly nice a day and I had some games too but seeing them now ruined me. I had not realized before how boring and nice this cartoon show was really. It's just plain awful! It's not a place close to the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and almost everyone has forgotten it once it stops production. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after it (if the mask does not put me into sleep first). One of the less cartoons of the 80s that I hope to completely forget again when it ends on Fox Kids!
