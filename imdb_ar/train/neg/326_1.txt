Adam Sandler's early film can be compared to his life as a comedian during the same period in 1989. It seems that his constant recognition of his hidden comic fascination and frustration with humor comes more from Sandler than the script. The film is not compared to his big feature films, such as Big Daddy or even Billy Madison. Unfortunately, Sandler did not find a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny way when the film was produced, such as his character. The majority of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler, who has talked to himself, usually through his unrecognized comic talent and beating himself because he is so ugly and can not get women. It's hard to see the film too because it does not treat itself as a real film. Sandler talks with the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to a low budget film or questionable content. The film is awkward at the end and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I saw this film after it was over, fearing that if he found out more about it, he would ruin his career at Sandler. Pass this offer from the video store and rent it for free and it was still a waste of time.
