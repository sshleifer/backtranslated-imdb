Three Russian aristocrats absorb the deterioration of Monte Carlo, despite the fact that they have reached another franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use fake services and use notes in casinos, hoping to replace the pseudo currency with the grand prize. Andrew Hughes, the US envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife, Helen, and the three decide to cooperate with the visitors, hoping for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with steady progress towards Helen, while the Countess servant, who loves Sergius, is disappointed. In the end, circumstances play their hands against the three aristocrats. It is clear that von Stroehm was trying to convey a message (foolishly American women and inappropriate behavior to aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the film can really carry modern audiences, like me, easily by doing so. So acting, something fantastic in EVS like Greed and Wedding March, is just a mill here. Movie enhancements can be used at different levels. Evaluation, 3.
