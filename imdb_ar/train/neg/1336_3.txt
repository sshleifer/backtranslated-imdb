This film was certainly not one of the best films of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and I was disappointed in this film. For some reason, it seemed like a movie they had really quickly assembled. In some parts, the situation became so boring that I had to progress quickly. He did not have any blots or any exciting parts like their other movies.
