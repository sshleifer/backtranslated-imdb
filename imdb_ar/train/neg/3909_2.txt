When I discovered that there was a film that had both his favorite actors, Merrill Streep and Wayne Rider, I went to the ceiling! But I faced a severe fall after watching this lame movie and still get a bruise. Jeremy Irons (actor I still admire even after these disappointments) were horrible plays. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not approach or sympathize with any of the characters and I am not proud, but sex scenes were not really necessary or could have been mitigated. It was possible to develop much more Wynona and Antonio characters and their emotional relationship may be more enthusiastic. What was with Merrill and her "Sufi forces"? Why did not they go to this more? The film had a lot of dead end, and in short, this movie was really poor and there was a lot of lost talent here.
