Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a printer and misses something in her life. She entered the Miss France contest against the wishes of her friend Andre (George Charlia) and won. She sets off to get the title of Miss Europe leaving her boyfriend behind. She won again but returned home to Andre because he asked her to do so. When she turns back, her life becomes so bad again, so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame Miss Europe is waiting for. Followed by Andre ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with a piano piece all the way. It's also fast so everything looks fast. A limited dialog has been added after that and is very fake. The cast is fine taking into account that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes in the end but the story goes on for a very long time. After watching this, I'm not really sure of the big problem that characterized the appearance of Louise Brooks - she has an awesome hair story that makes her face look fat. You do not need to see it again.
