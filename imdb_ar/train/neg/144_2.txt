There is no way to describe how bad this film really is. It's a shame that I've already sat in this film, this film is very cumbersome and predictable. what's wrong with that? Representation: There is no single performance close to being substandard (at least they are all very beautiful). Soundtrack: "If we get Orgy in the soundtrack, everyone will know they're watching a horror film!" Soundtrack (Score): Well, anyone with a keyboard can make good soundtracks these days. So do not make me start in "What the hell?" Moments, these are some of them: the killer can move at the speed of light, the door opens actress rolls, there is no one, back, there is something sitting in front of her; Moviemakers get points to connect at least, but can I really believe that the killer took time to find the power outlet to connect it. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy See and I want to say, "Where will you get the strength training? I can continue in this film and how bad this film is, but I have only 1000 words ... I will give this 2 out of 10 stars. Other for each split. Seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
