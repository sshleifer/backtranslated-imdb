This is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. She makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although, technically speaking, it is well-made, acting, cinema, music, output, etc., good. However, the rape scene of the closing gang is the most shocking and violent thing I've ever seen, and I really hope I do not see it. I'm afraid he'll haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think anyone would find the film very disturbing, my wife and some friends were victims in a very similar way and I did not really need a frank reminder of the horror they were exposed to. She watched the film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas and did not attend any of the actors or crew. I wish they had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I felt was excessive, unjustified and unnecessary. A previous scene shifted the mood they were apparently fighting for, but without rubbing your face in clear and explicit sexual violence. This movie should contain a large warning label. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
