Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment to me. While the actors did a good job, especially Smith, there is no cure for bad texts once production. The film was really a kind of "sequel", featuring partial events from the first film. It was a story, a word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out and seemed very volatile and sometimes uncoordinated. <br /> <br /> In the first click, MIB had a sense of "elite" power. You had a few private agents and had a "secret" type of sense. In sequel, MIB Organization has the appearance of JROTC Summer Camp. <br /> <br /> The movie was not terrible or anything .. It lacked "coolness" (because of the lack of a better phrase) than the first movie. Much of the same old humor has been recycled from first to second, and no originality has really been added to MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> The ideal analogy is Episode 1 to the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Do you deserve to bear the title? Not right.
