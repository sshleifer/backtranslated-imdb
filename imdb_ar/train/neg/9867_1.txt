I saw this before the awards season last year, and I did not really know why they went out after the voting ended, but whatever it was, maybe at least, but the film was in a state of chaos. Sure, some of the parts were funny with a kind of black humor, but none of the characters were real to me at all. There was not one person I could contact, and I think that's where it failed for me. Sure, the plot is a little thrilling and very subversive towards Scientology, Wow! What a great idea ... Let's see if this mining has already been done to the point of tampering. The whole ordeal feels like a faking, from lighting, casting, script, and even horrible visual effects (which are supposed to be intentional, I can say so, so anyone else, no one can laugh with you). In any case, I hope to make it available for sale on DVD at least, I do not want a project where it is clear that many people are making a lot of effort without noticing any attention. But they are intestines in both directions. The intestines are boring in that.
