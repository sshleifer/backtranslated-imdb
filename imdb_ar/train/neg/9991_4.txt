First, I'm not here to make this movie. I find it quite enjoyable despite the poor quality of production. The act here is as abhorrent as the beast that haunts them, although the beast itself has been well done ... it has been done admirably, in that. It really looks like some other earthly things, like a foreign family on a Himalayan holiday landing, and while my father was out ... he was attending a nature call, fell down and had no time to chase him. This, or is the Caucasian brother of Wishmaster. I did not decide which one. <br /> <br /> In fact, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in the snow country, yes, but most likely in Canada somewhere more than anywhere in China. She tells me the trees and views of Canada, and it is good that the specific area never takes shape or feels the extreme coldness one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Moreover, apparently (as we have just established) science fiction managers do not travel much, because they do not realize that commercial aircraft fly over the weather like what is contained here, and the subsequent collision actually will not happen. But as I said, it's Sci-Fi Channel so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes beautiful, and runs between "Alive" about Donner Party and "Predator" about the alien in the jungle, and any bad wushu movie where it flies on wires. It's obvious that Yeti can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... Remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer!" <br /> <br /> Also, I miss the Yeti Dabah. I've been looking for him high and low, but he does not seem to be working hard. Poor Yeti! You can only feel sorry for it. It has survived and evolved for thousands of years just to undergo a severe teddy bear loss. The bear has missed him. Or maybe you want to mate, but this thought has faded! do you hear me? Well, he seems to be an unmarried man. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> He is superhuman. Well, she's not human ... she's the queen of Yeti! But then again, what is natural Yeti? I do not know, but he has the specific quality of Michael Myers quite alarming. He has got this wonderful way to clean the fur. Wonderful Dahlink! It's sometimes spotless white when it should not be. It is superhuiously superhu - ... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? This was a lot of fun to watch, has some great murder and some honest plot elements. Despite its pebble-style production, it is actually very entertaining. I can only wonder if they are planning for another? <br /> <br /> 6.0 / 10 is evaluated on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> 4.4 / 10 on the scale of the film is evaluated ... <br /> <br /> Wicked :.
