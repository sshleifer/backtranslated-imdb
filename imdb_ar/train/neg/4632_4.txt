Maria Bello does not seem to care what people think of her choices in film roles. Once again, she chose a very difficult and unpopular film to star in.

It is her performance that raises this film. This along with the theme is almost a strange trick for me. But in the end (even if you try to overlook some of the flaws, such as rhythm speed and drama), the film is still long
