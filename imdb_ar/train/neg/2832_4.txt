Michael Ken has always claimed Ashanti was "the only film he made for money" and "his worst film". Wait, Michael, were not you in a squadron and Harry Sandon? Were not both films worse than Ashanti? Ken may recall with great sadness the physical demands of shooting Action at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (director Richard Fleischer entered the hospital as a result of a stroke during the filming). What Ashanti actually shows is not the low point in Michael Kane. Instead, it's a very exciting movie chasing with talented actors, weird sites, boring stretches and a very high-profile storyline. <br /> <br /> d. David Linderbay (Kane) is a doctor working in Welch and devastated by the loss of his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) during an aid trip to an African tribal village. Lindervi gradually realizes that his wife has been kidnapped by slave traders - led by Solomon (Peter Ostinov) - and embarked on a continent-wide drive that eventually leads to the Middle East. <br /> <br /> Along the way, big stars appear in inactive and unnecessary guest roles. William Holden has a poor veil as a helicopter pilot. Omar Sharif shows little of his charm or great grace as a spoiled Arab millionaire. Rex Harrison seems genuinely bored during his short role as a helpful contact person helping Cayenne in his quest. The film is based on the bestseller Ebano, by the unknown author Alberto Vasquez Figueroa, but the thrill that made the book very common is largely absent in this amendment. Ustinov is an attractive character because the slave (he appears in all his films is unable to make bad performances), and Ken generates incredible dreams as a man who thinks he will never see his wife again. There are flashes of work from time to time, but on the whole, Ashanti seems slow-moving. All in all, it's a thrilling piece of motion - not at all terrifying as Caine has repeatedly suggested, but it's not a very inspiring film and certainly of all the talent involved.
