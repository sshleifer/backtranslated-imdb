I do not know where to start. The film looks like one of those children on a sabbatical Saturday morning that shows they used to come back in the late 1990s. Kind of like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital sequences, "secret agencies" and really bad guys. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it is not funny. The trend is terrible and there is little continuity now. It seems as if someone threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film comes early, when many villains plant an explosive device in a car dealership. For some reason, although the device was clearly shown to have been "remotely detonated," the bad guys decided to chase her on their motorcycles as she drove away. This hunt carries on. All this time with the bad guys who make the bike ridiculous and ridiculous. Stand on bikes, do wheelies and so on. At some point, a crash occurs and one of the attackers is thrown out of his bike. We see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown at the vehicle of the agents but the rider has disappeared. After that, after a few seconds, the rider and the bike returned ... apparently without damage due to the accident. At this point, although the car has an explosive device, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving in the past, then blow up her car. Which has also been clearly identified with CGI. Sound confusing? It is, as well as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It has been pointed out that when I say cgi, we are not talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We're talking about the cheap cgi type of Power Rangers cgi, in fact I think it could have been better done on Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why did Savini and Todd make this film that I would never know, I can only assume I did for money, for someone's sake or because it was blackmailed ... maybe the last one.
