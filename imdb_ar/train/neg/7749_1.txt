This movie must never be. From bad animation to do, to beyond misconduct. I'm not sure where the people behind this film said, "Well, it looks good! Let's do it!" I was in awe of how terrified this film really was. At one point, perhaps the worst point is, the computer created a tooth saber of gold falling from the ceiling stabbed an idiot creator of cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the paralyzed film was killed within minutes of his first appearance. The other two managed to kill a handful of people before they were burned and shot. Then, there is a random person waiting for the victims in the forest ... which frightens me for one reason. Will there be a second part? God, for human beings everywhere, I hope not to do so. <br /> <br /> The film was pure trash. From PowerPoint point credits to the end of the slide show.
