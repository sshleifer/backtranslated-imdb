I've done a bit of watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I feel sorry or not. I felt like I was watching the film produced by that group of film school students that did not penetrate the film. It plays a role in all imaginable Hollywood cliches, while flogging us with the message "Companies are the ultimate evil." The accuracy of this film does not know. As far as it goes, it can even provide its own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to have become a computer science fiction world. The main character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet he is a genius in programming and a virtual intruder (I think) among many other elements of real fiction that you should see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Well, I should have known that it would be a z movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... tends to be a good communication. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this one, I'm afraid.
