This is one of the worst films I have ever encountered, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I have heard have been found to be unjustified. <br /> <br /> With regard to pure filmmaking technology, this director is competent. It's stumbled because of the limited budget and VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene layout are very professional. I have seen many films where the "output" was much worse. The scenes flow at least in a confusing way and have a few smart shots here and there. Also, forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. You can only do a VHS camera, and it does a great job as far as technical means are concerned. As far as artistic merit, there is nothing. The scene in which the camera rolls so that we can see a man urinating in the forest for 15 seconds is a kind of artistic feature for the entire film. This trash basket is pure ... total garbage. <br /> <br /> The right image is suitable for a movie within this budget range. , It is obviously fake but there are many of them, which is very strange .. <br /> <br /> I have seen the American version with the dubbing deliberate intentional. This was a good idea (and this is the only thing I was allowed to take out through the film) ... Unfortunately, it has gone beyond the minimum, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it because it is a camp value. It's really hard to find a worse film and this kind of film puts it in a unique category.
