I loved the bright clicks of the 1980s and remember that when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled out of our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these photos on Fear.net. I've been better off watching what I expect from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was laughable by today's standards, personal development for a long time, but everyone in all was laughing out loud funny! <br /> <br /> The scenes he loses are because Santa, nicknamed Abby, feels his mother's sense and later when the mob actually shows the lighting flares - not the light bulbs as they did in the eighties, but the real torches! - Really tickling funny bone. However, the scenes in which he checked the children in his neighborhood gave me a false sense of a different character. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who these representatives were. It took me some time to figure out that the main character was a lovable teddy bear on the brothers.
