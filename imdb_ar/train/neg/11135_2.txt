What will I say more? Representation was, almost without exception, amateurs. Routing and continuity are pitiful. Sainsplay was predictable down to the last scene and the boring dialogue. One of the features on the DVD was named "Gag Reel," but it could have been a description of the viewer's reaction to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things about the manager's comments on the cylinder. He said, with a straight face, that he started producing a film with high production values ​​and names - and it worked. With such illusions, it is easy to understand how the film appeared as it did. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the monster is the most frustrating side. The Darkwolf suit was a modified monkey suit (according to the "make" feature on a DVD) and instead I looked at it. The mask and tentacles were a bit better off off the shelf than any fashion store. The effects of CGI were painfully clear and of a similar quality to cheap video games.
