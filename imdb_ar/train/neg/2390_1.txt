I loved all Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and I was interested in seeing a film that was produced after one of his books. I knew there would be no way to capture the film for half of Rubens' magic, but after watching the film, I never wanted to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls does not include the eighth content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love relationship between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak line of conspiracy in the film, I think it is certainly possible to choose the best actors to play characters. The only actors in the film whom I thought played their roles in line with Robbins' descriptions in the book are Julian's friends, in their five-minute clip at the beginning of the film. Those who did not read the book might enjoy the film, but as a huge fan Tom Robbins, the film was nothing more than a disappointment.
