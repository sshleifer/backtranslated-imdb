Worse than the rating given to him. It's a typical SciFi movie at the moment: bad to bad acting, poorly written script, and bad direction. From the opening scene where Demille is buried by his group until the end, this film is very bad. At the beginning of the film's scenes, Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the film Demel), Pharaoh (Jol Brenner) and Nefritere (Anne Baxtor) look at a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that would represent the above three icons were horrible and had to resemble the people who were "presumed" to be. The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is injured and they all cry by ambulance. It is clear that the screenwriter is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morina Bacarin decided to produce a film of this inferior quality.
