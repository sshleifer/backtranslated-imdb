I just returned from "El Otro" I play here in Buenos Aires and I must say I was very disappointed. The film is slow to move (do not miss, I enjoy slow motion movies!), So slow that it leads you crazy. All you hear is that Julio Ch√°vez breathes heavily throughout the film. This is a badly made film, but more importantly, it is a film without licking inspiration, and I did not feel anything about the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> The film "El Otro" was produced in order to make a film ... make it forgotten. If you want to watch good Argentinian movies, check out movies for Syria.
