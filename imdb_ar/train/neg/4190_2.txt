I saw this movie a few months ago in the town that appeared as Gryndale in the film, and that's the only reason I've ever seen her. Another local person who had just sent me an e-mail ad repeated the offer because the first version had been sold and the people were removed. His editorial commentary on the front is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of Neil Young or live in / near "Greendale" (if you finally know the real name), skip this movie. It's mostly the ego journey of the director. It does not have any discernible plot, the music is fine, and a lot of words are incomprehensible making it impossible to follow what might happen from the small pieces of the plot. <br /> <br /> You do not need to put a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give up. <br /> <br /> I will give this 1.5 / 10, but this is only for the entertainment value of seeing places converted to a movie. It was not worth $ 6. I could rent a video camera and walk around "Greendale" and make a better film myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good environmental message film * Without a plot, rent Koyaanisqatsi.
