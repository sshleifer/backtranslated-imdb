If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good film. But I read the book. Ever screen writing ruined a story. There are a lot of changes that were not worth the title. Changes in personality, changes in schema, changes in timeline ... <br /> <br /> First, who was Henry and the investigator? They were not in the story. Henry was somewhat Mitch, but Mitch was not a policeman. No, I've made you so Roz, helped in "drowning" his body and used it as a blackmailer for Zenia against Roz. The so-called real blackmail was that Rose thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted to get away from him. Her son was being blackmailed because he was hiding and being gay about his mother. Her son was not mentioned even in the story. I did not believe he was his lover, Rose's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and Wiste were not together at first. He was actually with Zenia first during his university studies. The black-painted apartment was their idea, and Tony went to visit. This is where Zinia and Tony meet and become fast friends. Tony hides her love for the West. Zinia then left the West, with money from Tony, then the West and Tony. Marriage eventually, at some point Tony leaves West for Zenia again for a short time. Just be broken heart again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony wrote a test paper for Zenia. Being now a college professor, she did not want to let her out. I will tell the character who played Tony's role wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Charis's personality was dark, not really important. Zinia did not deceive her because of cancer while Augusta was alive. It was not there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father, was a fugitive in the Vietnam War. In the end, after taking care of Charisma in Zenia for months, he was not in fact a drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair under the nose of Charis while they take care of them. Then Zinia turns to Billy to the government and leaves him on the ferry. Not with Augusta, Caris was pregnant with her. Charles also had a divided personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zinia did not die because she was cut into a piece .... and she fell or maybe was pushed (we never knew) from the balcony and landed in the fountain. She had almost pure heroin grade in her blood, and she was likely taken some not know and fell as ODD is. She was already dying of cancer this time. <br /> <br /> None of the childhood memories or anything loved by the reader. The book was planned even bare bones. Then go back to see someone else. Why not only can you write your own story like what you produced in the movie. It was quite different, and I'm sure it was possible to do more.
