A tense comedy, a sketch-like review that was initially a way to show Jack Perle's one-time radio star, but better remembered now as the American presenter for The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Carly and Moe are being held alongside comic Ted Healy like Ted Healy and three officers. Although supporting actors are Jimi Durante (who is completely lost on dark matter) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the movie these days is addicted to Stooges, and they will not even find much praise here. Incredibly loud and overly arrogant, it shows how much Hollywood has to go to a certain level of distraction. * 1/2 of ****
