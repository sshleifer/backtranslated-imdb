What a snore festival. <br /> <br /> Of all the nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to reproduce and update, this is one of the most senseless games. This was a totally useless show in the first place, and we really do not need a modern update. <br /> <br /> You do not care about the intolerance and sexual discrimination inherent in the system from the beginning, so much progress has been made socially, since the presentation focused on the fact that the full point of the offer (if any) was lost. <br /> <br /> Also, what is the purpose of getting a character named Boss Hogg if it is not a plus weight?
