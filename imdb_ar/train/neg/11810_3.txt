I noticed with some entertainment that at the end of the credits, Detroit PD is thanked for its participation. The police chief has one speaking line that plays himself (and boy, can you say he can not act). The reason for entertainment is that in this film the police are shot first and ask questions later. This is not the kind of PR, I think the police force wants. Other than that, this is your movie of policemen and robbers dressed in the 70's with an ethnic angle. Alex Roque is given a disdainful role for a policeman who can not move forward and takes on a mental wife. He makes up for it by hanging in a local prostitute. Harry Rhodes is his loving partner who has a wonderful wardrobe and loves to chase suspects in a coat. The film goes on until the penultimate, never-ending exchange of fire (why do convicted people only deal with theft, with full police force?). We do not see just one correction, but because there are four of the bad guys, we'll see four. Then there is a crooked end that is supposed to leave one guessing what was actually going to happen but just let me think how stupid he was. When I saw that director Arthur Marks was also behind Fred Frindy and Packtown, I did not wonder.
