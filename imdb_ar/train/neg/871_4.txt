Nicholas Walker is Paul, a local town of Riverand who married Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also a usual fake woman and decides to falsify his death to escape with his current relationship, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also at hand as an old madman who conspires to reverand good in the shadows of the "misery" kind of way. Sad to see a wonderful team wasted like this. Not least John Savage in a role that can be terribly forgotten as a poor private investigator. In a film called "Black Comedy," you have to insert both elements into the movie. While this does not bring the first in the spades, it unfortunately does not contain any of the latter. Moreover, you can not confirm with any of the characters and therefore, you have no interest in it. Technically, it is not a very bad film but a very forgotten film. <br /> <br /> A candy eye: Dara Tomanovic is naked; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
