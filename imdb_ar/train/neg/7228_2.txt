Good: Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top Production Group. CGI buildings and vehicles are well detailed. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> A great mix of actors with all CGI actors mixing Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI players look worse than video games a few years ago. Defective logic. A giant pyramid appears and no one is looking for it, and no one really asks about it? There is no explanation for the exclusion of God Horus, and there is no reason why he does something trivial like the generation of impregnation? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> The script is awful. Lots of unnecessary sub-schemas with lots of ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost laughable at some points. Random characters and random events are not required. The characters are boring. Generation is supposed to be this puzzle, but it seems to have been just a puzzle for the writer. There is nothing to it. They are monotonous and boring to watch. It has no material, no texture. Her personality has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is no single character in the entire film has any purpose, no goals (besides one clear of Horus), no motive. They are weak and poorly visualized. No quotas - screen writing key. Horus will not be immortal, but he is a very bad man. One can not even decipher whether Horus or Gill is the main character. This is the problem: the allocation of half the film to each character means that the writer never fully explores one personality, and never leads to fruit. They are cardboard cutters walking and talking and doing nothing but exploring the beautiful pieces. First Time Speed ​​Manager. Slow, slow, slow. I still watch the movie as I write this. I can not pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. So the procedure is not interesting because it is short-term and sometimes unnecessary. Story Threadbare, the development of substandard character, cliche cGI does not save a nice collection production.
