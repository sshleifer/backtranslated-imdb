I am a big fan of war films, and as a veterinarian in Vietnam, I have some experience in technical details. I have worked with bomb men more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, and Iraqis in particular, summed up the inaccuracy in this film. The poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy, and it failed badly because of it. No unit will be tolerated for bomb disposal, or any unit, with this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military contingents enjoy compliance and discipline for some reason; they save lives. The opening scene bothered me in particular. The man carrying the cell phone was shot instantly. Screaming, "off communication" is not an effective deterrent. The situation is worse than there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly horrific. As others have noticed, the normal EOD person you do not know Jack about being a sniper, thinking that any Arab sniper is that good really extends the imagination. The kidnapping of an Arab businessman will not happen to a form of personal revenge. Someone may shoot it, but that kind of risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but as I said, others pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good film, and if he wins any prizes at all, it is an additional reflection of why La La land is named by that name.
