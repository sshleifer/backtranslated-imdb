You can not withstand this knowing that it was manufactured in four days, and I expected it to be a camp anyway. Except for Kevin Calisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the actors play them straight in the middle of the road; and Riley Smith is very bad.) The funny story actually drives attention to what kind of shock; The full purpose of these low-budget horror films is to satisfy the most basic sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story, but they use a lot of words like "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their point of view across. (Although it is possible that the story is important only to explain why there are very few members of the acting team). No one cares about this stupid story, and the only interesting things in the film are the irony of rituals and soft homosexuality (which is not all that flustered). I would have enjoyed it more if there had been some random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a TV-quality appearance and level of representation. There are some "erotic" scenes that are fine - boys flocking in bed in boxers, feeling themselves; or being constrained and making orgasmic faces while the wine is poured on them - some of them somewhat funny. I liked L. Ron Hubbard's fossils and the intended irony of a story about religious cultures that she told about intense gay detail, but it is still not good. 10/03
