Jungle fever is very stylized, stereotyped, and happens to be basically dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong in the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Anibella Ciorira. Although there is a lot of talent in this film, it is mostly lost due to the shrinking of the parts into more than just a decorative veil. Also, instead of just showing racism on this ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee chooses to flag him like a flag in the most disturbing way. I've managed to make most of the films but I could not complete them completely, and that rarely happens to me.
