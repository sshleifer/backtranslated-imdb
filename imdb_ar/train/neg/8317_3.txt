For a film about a killer, it's amazingly boring. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens much, and even when things happen, they generate no real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> Representation is good from the two lists, Cassetti in particular performs a wonderful performance that combines the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the actors also do what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is bad writing and direction and the fact that it is not an interesting story, Succo is not a unique character, it is not sexy or sexy. <br /> <br /> Films of this kind usually try to generate tension, sympathy or anger and this only generates a sense of regret because you wasted your time watching it.
