I just finished watching "El Otro". I always took my hat for Julio Ch√°vez, because he is a great actor, but this film is very frustrating and slow. I thought it would have been worse if it had not been for Julio. In any case, this is definitely a film you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I advise you not to rent this movie in order to spend a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... It is really frustrating and incredibly slow, The plot is meaningless as well. The director may have wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is impress the audience and admire them with scenes that shock you a little. Gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I certainly do not like this movie.
