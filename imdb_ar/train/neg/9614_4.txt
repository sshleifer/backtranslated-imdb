I would not recommend this unless you are keen on David Copperfield and would like to "complete the collection". There are some good shows (such as Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (such as batting), but in general they are dwarfed by the 1999 BBC release, as well as previous releases. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes to the story that really do not serve a great purpose except, perhaps, to omit them (stolen jewelry is an example). American actors were badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong like Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is slightly better than Cockney Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Mikauber; he weighs too much and becomes troublesome. He also speaks of his lines in a tone that transcends strangeness and simply becomes futile. Anthony Andrews is threatened by Mr Murdstone, but one is almost expected to wear a black head and tie David's mother to a railway line (although this may be partly Dickens' fault). <br /> <br /> I got this for free with a newspaper. That helped me through Sunday afternoon, but I was more disappointed than his charm at the end
