This film was very disappointed in the direction, the intellectual plot, the plot and the way it dealt with his theme, painting. It is a slow motion film like a cycle of wonders, with a terrible lack of depth. He also fails to deliver his message convincingly. <br /> <br /> The approach to drawing is extremely eloquent and is limited to vague and subjective terms such as "beauty". According to the makers of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in reflective landscape paintings of the Bob Ross style. Good art can be achieved according to this film by applying basic color theory (such as primary school level) and a lot of emotions. In the film's disturbing film parts, for example at some point it is mentioned (instead, it is celebrated through dancing on the tables) that mentally disabled people are not able to get feelings or express them through drawing, as their actions by definition "Nonsense" has no value (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the film can get such a high rating, and then again, so far not many people rated it, and they chose very high or very low grades only.
