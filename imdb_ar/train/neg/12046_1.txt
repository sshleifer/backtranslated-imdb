I had high hopes for Troy and I was very disappointed. The film was so badly taken out that it made my stomach sore. The speed was very slow, the dialogue was funny and the film - apart from a nice fighting scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (PANA) - the rest was shallow. <br /> <br /> Why, why? Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris outside the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It bothers me that this classic story turned into soap. <br /> <br /> You do not even show me the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. The woman who fought the war did not look as if the two were too interested in the other. There are no sparks, no passion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I must say in the defense films that Brad Pitt and Eric Pana and Peter Iolle were well behaved in a film line but that is not enough to keep this film awful. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the Â£ 200m budget went? Perhaps in all the trees they used in funerary columns - where did they get all those trees? <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed because this is painful.
