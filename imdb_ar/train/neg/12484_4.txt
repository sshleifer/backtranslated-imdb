Woo ??! a man?? What can I say ...? <br /> <br /> The opening scene, perhaps? We see a bunch of Mongolian barbarians with bad make-up jumping from the walls of some of the ruins. They infiltrate and attack some of the dude with a captive girl in a few clothes. The dude escapes, followed by the Mongols and one of them seems to be behind him to rape the girl, but instead reveals one of her breasts and abducts her. After that, the dude (still running) sees the horse and tries to steal it. Suddenly?? The blonde hero looks like God with a bad wig, saying "This is my horse!". The Mighty Deathstalker just made its debut. The arrival of the Mongols, Deathstalker kills all of them (including the dude) on the tunes of some inappropriate Western Mexican points (supposed to be the swords and sorcery flick, what happens with 'tribpettos'?) Go up to Captive Girl and uncover both of her breasts. Just as they are about to reach him, this old man appears, interrupting what could have been the perfect end of the day for Deathstalker (and a possible end to a short film). </ P> <p> > <br /> Now tell me ?? Is not that the point where any feminist closes in with the fury of the film, or says any scenes? "The plot is as simple as throwing a little cat out of the balcony: Deathstalker must get the sword of justice and use it to steal the life amulet and the magic trophy from the evil wizard Munkar. <br /> <br /> Head-cutting, And the embarrassing sword battles, this film also contains a huge amount of footage and clips $ $ At first I wanted to add an extra point to this film for every free shot of the adventures I can rely on. After 9 points (not even the middle of the film), I had to give up counting. He distracted me from the rest of the film. The rest of the movie was worth it. Stuff completely crazy. Check out this Munkar-like creature as a pet that feeds eyeballs and fingers. Here's an interesting question: What would you do if a man walked into your bedroom and tried to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple: you slapped him a bit, took the knife and then tried to rape him. Then you discover that he is not actually a woman, so get rid of your bed and ask him to leave your room. This works fine, I tell you. Deathstalker does it too, and the Deathstalker method, is the right way! <br /> <br /> DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie, as described in other comments. Lousy villains. The women are delicious. There is blood, sex, violence, rape, and delicious chicken. There is a useless tournament behind them, characterized only by a group of barbarians who beat them and penetrate them and penetrate their folly. My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer, used to beat a poor competitor in the bloody pulp. My favorite opponent was undoubtedly the brute with the head of Warthog (reminiscent of the Gamorrean guards of the RETURN OF THE JEDI). I will not reveal how the film ends, but just get ready to be pleased when I tell you to tear 4 directions at the height of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a fantastic display of incompetence throughout the entire film. He saw a man being dragged behind a horse on a dirt road. The next shot from his point of view showed that he was dragged on the grass (without a road). See this wonderful tattoo on the head of the magician magically changing sides within the same scene (the picture appears on the left side of his head and the other on the right). Well, after all, Munkar is enchanting. It is, or has been filmed in an alternative world where there are no such things as "continuity" simply. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed this and as much as I look forward to the other 3 installments in this series, I have enough shredding disrespect left to me not to let this movie pass through. I'm ready, however, to give it as many points as I can, so I can cut a few more points for a sequential sequel. DEATHSTALKER may be a wonderful, fun, fun and full of fun, and it's a hateful movie.
