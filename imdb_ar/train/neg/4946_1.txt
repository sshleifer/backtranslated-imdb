Admittedly, I have seen this piece with very low expectations already. Dieter Bohlen is a somewhat uneducated musical composer whose size has not been as great as his talent. <br /> <br /> It was the first animated film I saw and was 100% humorless. It is shameless, offensive, backward and blatantly hostile to women. As such, it is a fitting creation of Bohlen, but the normal viewer will be somewhat delayed. No wonder it was never shown in a movie theater: it was possible to bomb a great time! <br /> <br /> Not even a 6.5 mega-euro account was able to save this comical piece. Save time and money!
