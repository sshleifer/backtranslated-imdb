To face it; some lame child dies and his soul has been moved into a scarecrow. DAS will not happen Niva! OMFG This stupid loser child who can not defend himself gets his ass delivered to him by some drunk drunk drunk his mother. When he dies, the scarecrow is seen and his spirit enters into the scarecrow. The drunken man covered up his death by making her look like a suicide bomber and was believed to have gotten rid of her. We later see that he was thrown out of the trailer and later gained another confrontation with Scarecrow. They had a brief meeting involving wine which he described as a loser and a scapegoat "one takes to know the loser!" Scarecrow scatters the building, calling it "Papa-o", then cutting off the poor man's head. We can see how this wonderful film unfolds. Go on to kill a lot of people, then. He basically kills people who gave him a hard time and explodes to kill some people who exercise their ass randomly, just for some laugh. Do not laugh here. Adds a punch to each kill, too. Every time he kills someone, he does some karate and finishes everything with one of his signature lines. In case someone was suffering from hearing impairment, he would say "Here, you have ears of corn!" Then the donkey shakes it. Or we can take an example of the film! He just finished killing a policeman and was on his way to kill the only person he stood for. Her father, Sheriff, shouted at the crazy man to stop, said, "Hey, stay a moment!" A dagger threw his chest and held it against some tree. At the end of the film, two players were killed and thrown into a punchline "Gotta split!" Two players were killed by pushing the sickle in their heads. Wowzors, this film made me want to wet my pants very badly. Maybe next time this man makes a film, he will not be gay.
