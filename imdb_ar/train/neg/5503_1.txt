I grew up watching the original TV series in the 1960s and one thing I can tell you right away, there is no comparison. This film was completely ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. Mars took different forms. Special effects that looked like something would be created by a toddler. In contrast, originally, the characters were developed and developed by Tim and Martin's viewers. The only distinction occurred in this film, yes, in fact there was one, happened when Ray Walston finally appeared in the end. He was wearing dark glasses and pointed to live on the planet for 30 years as a kind of greeting to the TV series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save Turkey.
