Underground Comedy, maybe the worst train wreck I've ever seen. Luckily I did not pay for this film, and my friend reluctantly agreed to see it again and he said it was so bad but he needed to prove to me how terrible it was. I love off color comedy. I figured at least they would get it and I would not be amusing, rather, the acting was extremely awful, the "jokes" were very cheesy, and the plot was not a place to be found. Maybe it was not supposed to be a plot so I can not afford this against this movie. It is very sad that the most extreme thing in the comedy is an old woman wearing her head with a bat ..... by Batman ... a man in a baseball uniform and hitting a bat. kidding. Simply a genius. I felt like watching this film made by the creators and they laughed hysterically with their friends around him. Perhaps this was full of internal jokes that we did not understand. Or perhaps the worst piece of waste ever made, and must be closed in a basement and dumped in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
