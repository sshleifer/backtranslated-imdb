This film does not offer any imagination at all in its hypothesis and its implementation, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this alleged comedy that does not have the energy to talk about. The story is about the picky on the director of insurance risk analysis Robin Viver (Ben Stiller), who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheated him with the diving coach (Hank Azaria) just one day after the honeymoon. Upon returning home, Robin and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) went to a party and entered Paul Prince (Jennifer Aniston) who went to school with previous years. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is tolerant and dirty and lives indifferently and is the opposite of who is Robin as a person but they start so far and Robin begins to change as a person as he begins to experience new things like salsa dancing And eat spicy foods. But one day, Lisa returns and wants to marry Robin, but he does not really want to, but Polly decides to leave because she does not believe in getting married. <br /> <br /> This film is the second effort by director John Hamburg, who wrote two unusual scenarios in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films appear to be classic compared to this meaningless piece. Very easy to say something is not funny, but I think that in this film, easy to find out why. This film is completely predictable from start to finish where each scene seems to be happening only because of the absurdity of the scenario. Hamburg, who wrote the script, also seems to have written this without thinking about trying something different. Sometimes he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as "There's Something About Mary," but instead the events seem incredibly compelling. Did anyone really think that the blind man was funny? If you do, your easy! Sometimes, during the characters of the film, these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is the exaggeration of clarity. Stellar works a lot, but maybe he should do less and wait for better scripts because it does not work as a comedy or as a friendship.
