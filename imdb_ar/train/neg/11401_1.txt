The script was too weak without enough character brackets to make you care a little about letters or what happens to them. The script is a very talkative and not gore or enough action so call it a slow paced. The story reaches as much as you wish only to silence everyone and die as soon as possible so that you do not have to listen to them talk about this hidden dialogue. Technically, the music mix is ​​a high way and makes it hard to understand what is being said most of the time. Then again, this can be called grace. In general, it was better that this same story be listed in a short film with a run time of less than 30 minutes. It was clear that "in your face" for Sam Remy and "Yves Did" was good if they were smarter, but here they seem to be like a sweat facing baldness. Come on, this kind of 35mm budget is the best that can be done? However, the cinematography, lighting design and footage were very well done already.
