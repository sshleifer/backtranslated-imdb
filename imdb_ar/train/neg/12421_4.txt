Mark Pero is "Deathrow Gameshow" of 1987, a very cheesy black comedy in many parts, but sometimes very funny. Sure, this film was a lot better, design is terrible, and some strange scenes make it difficult to see at times, but the concept is funny, and has some fun moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a show called "Live Or Die", where convicted prisoners on death row have a chance to play for their lives and for money. Candidates who fail on air are executed using many different methods, such as guillotine, electric chairs and other more unusual execution devices, followed by applause from the delightful studio audience. The show, of course, is more than controversial, Chuck has made a lot of enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is very cheesy and crazy in many aspects, and the representation is terrible, but it is undoubtedly fun in many parts, If you are a lover of dark humor. You did not miss anything if you have not seen it, but it is definitely a funny and fun time. 10/04
