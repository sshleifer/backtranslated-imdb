I'm sure that Operations Dames was my favorite day for drivers. There is absolutely nothing at all in a plot that you might miss if you are busy otherwise. If you need to get a mood for other activities, you've got some violent TV images that appear on the screen to get your mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not much to do with Ladies Operations. . She was appointed in the Korean War, where a platoon of military soldiers with a British Tommy moves forward a little and has to return to the UN lines. Bad indeed, but these men also encountered a group of stranded girls and dancing girls in the same predicament. <br /> <br /> You know that what saddens this film is that it took generations of women to be finally accepted by the army and in cases of fighting. These bimbos of the USO re-edit women's light year. In fact, even the biting professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can not keep him in his pants. <br /> <br /> But maybe it's better to remind some of what they were driving. To on. This distinguished name is no better for me and I do not realize any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operations Dames are definitely a flop team.
