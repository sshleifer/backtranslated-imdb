This is a review of Mercy The Untold Story, a play version, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the finest documentary films I've ever seen. If the movie I saw in a movie theater was originally shown on television, I beg with its producers and distributors not to deceive an audience with a false promise of documentary merit. Although the documentary film specifically designed for television, the emotional piano accompaniment of those who interview and sit in front of arrangements for flowers in the hotel rooms and pseudo-literary narrative ring more than the bed. The only aspects of "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" are the original music and video clips - Freddie Mercury and the Queen. Interviews with eyewitnesses are not connected with visions, such as: "It was a liberal spirit" (I really thought that Freddie Mercury was a man in the company ...) Reduces those Freddy testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Kapal who looked New and affectionate light in the complex life of Mercury and her personality. And ... what's up with the inner school classes that resemble Harry Potter? How did the interview with the first girl crush ("Who works now in a travel agency") and members of Freddie's first school team in what I really want to know about Mercury? The vital landmarks in his personal life, his sexual life, his artistic style and his growth, Queen, the band is still unexplored. These filmmakers do not pose a single provocative question. They do not participate in independent research or insight into their subject. Instead, they offer a hard, polite and largely empty commentary on the mysterious and brilliant rock legend that you do not deserve to remember through this history channel. Snooze on Sunday night.
