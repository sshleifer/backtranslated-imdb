I always thought that Cinderella 2 was the worst movie I ever saw, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other shots like The Lion King 2 and Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea. Because the film has no plot, they try to compensate it by filling the jokes. I do not say that jokes are bad, but they make up most of the film. The first time I saw the movie, I would give it 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not care about the quality of the original film, they just care about the movie being fun. I still think that the movie was a bad supplement, but that does not mean it is horrible. Now I think it's worth 3/10.
