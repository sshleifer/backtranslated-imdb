I hope the saints will keep us because this film will not help. <br /> <br /> Someone who has access to the e-mail needs Mel Gibson and tells him that we need a loyal production of Beowulf. There is something already common with the epic poem that forms the basis of all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> Beowulf's recent (since 2000) versions make us wonder about two things. First, why is there so much interest in the story. Second, why do all these directors waste huge sums on this nonsense? <br /> <br /> The only reason this made two gets is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed to be. <br /> <br /> What's worse, some people will be watching This and they get the wrong idea about the poem. How can the industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary transformation into a movie is completely wrong to make mistakes. I really mean, the Roman Forum as a model for the Herut is very many. <br /> <br /> Please, horns on helmets? Forgive me. This is an insult. <br /> <br /> / hjm
