Whattt was with the sound? It looked like it was all called a name. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = Bad. Accents = bad (even Dougraye, we live in Scotland), proxy = bad, harp = bad, sex scenes - bad / worthwhile. <br /> <br /> However, we have seen it to the very end in disbelief. How can such a good call for actors perform very poorly? Will they get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we have given it 3 because we are at least eager to see it to the end because of its strange plots, etc. <br /> <br /> For the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s. How was it made in 2004? <br /> <br /> Well, there were some bits. They had a lovely house in Bristol. Dugry was a beautiful boat. Jennifer looked cute in a little outfit. But how did the sister get all the men?
