I can not really think of anything good to say about this film ... not one thing. The scenario is a nightmare. The writer blurs the line between chemical and biological features and does not seem to understand the difference. You think they will get at least a technical adviser. The performances were bad for most of the actors ... although I do not really blame them. The editing was just as bad .. I'll stop now .. all bad 2/10
