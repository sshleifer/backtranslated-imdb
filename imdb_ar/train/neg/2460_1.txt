I really wanted to love this movie, but it never gave me a chance. Spinal Tap is supposed to be the subject of hip hop, but it failed miserably. It's always like a high school kid's writing and acting in a school project, and it's also the level at which humor appears to be aimed at. There is no accuracy, and more impressive than irony, I have never felt like a documentary film. Although the lines are not funny in the first place, the attempt to deliver on the deadly path has helped - certainly, nothing will be better than the over-shouting we are experiencing. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend this to people who like "comedy" in the context of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are hilariously funny in nature. Others must get away and not waste their time.
