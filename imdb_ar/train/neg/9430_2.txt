I too, was fooled by the packaging. I too, fell because of the amazing packaging and DVD covers that claim "sad fans where every copy of the shelves were pulled" although they were inexpensive ($ 6.99), it was not really worth it - no fear, very limited gore. The end was very cheesy and did not give you the hole you should be. I really do not even know how I became a "nasty video" with how tame it is. The story continues, the characters are clearly amateur actors ... do not live up to the promise. The DVD Reward feature ("interview") is very strange as the director seems very incoherent and not everything there. The leading actress talks like she appears in the production of Shakespeare. It's a big laugh.
