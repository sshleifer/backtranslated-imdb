We all know even before its broadcast, the little Ron Moore series is not Battlestar Galactica. this is good. This only means that it must stand on its own. Can not lean on Star Wars Galactica. If anything is good, he is good at his own merits, and has Ron Moore who is proud of him. If the reports are true, that's what Moore wants. However, if his mini-series rot, he has betrayed all the excellent actors who performed on the screen, not to mention the countless staff outside the screen. That's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a new edition. I will not even call it re-imagined. It is a new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. Not happening in the world of Galactica, with the same places, terminology and technology. He does not tell us about Galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. Nor do they depend on the myths and mysteries on which Galactica was founded. The small Ron Moore series is a space opera, flick off action with a celebratory gesture to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, another space opera, just a movement. Because with plots approaching, he has little or no original or even interesting. I can tell you the whole thing without warning from the spoiler. But I will not bring you this. I just hit the most important point. ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything that is in the story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the creations of man occupy man and seek to destroy man. (I think they forgot Azimov rules, again.) They look like humans, so there are all the aliens among us. At least there is no time to travel. Oh, a lot of scenes of fighting and acts of sex and indiscriminate violence. The end result is that when Moore took Galactica, that ceremonial gesture, was more disturbing than respect. I mean, can not even think of anything special about it? <br /> <br /> Since the first few minutes, I wanted to see something else. I did not care about any of Moore's characters, since I could not communicate with any of them. This fact shocked me in the face when Celon began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, I did not give a damn. How frustrating. <br /> <br /> Mor heroes when they face an insurmountable obstacle, rather than overcome them, instead of the pointy tail and saved by their heels. After all, it was the only way to save mankind, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe route, instead of risking their lives to defend others. At least, disgust is not carelessness. <br /> <br /> But in the end, the miniature Ron Moore series was just an aimless activity, a film on a vicious circle, not working forever. I just wanted it to end. By the time it was over, the power of my life had absorbed me. Despite my own will, I was transformed into a mindless coma, perhaps of the kind that this mini-series would attract. I needed to renew myself. You need to - I swear this is true - you need to watch a ring of Babel 5. Two episodes, I felt a great improvement. And happier.
