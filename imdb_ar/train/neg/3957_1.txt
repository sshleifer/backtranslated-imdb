Boogeyman was the original silly but supernatural fun flick. It was not a wonderful but enjoyable film in the right frame of mind. The third installment in this series, Boogeyman's return, on the other hand, is simply awful. Consists of two things. First, new shots are cheap and lifeless. Second, loads of recycled bits from the first film. The new material is incredibly amateurish but not in an amusingly inefficient way, simply incredibly boring. It is clear that these shots were assembled quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for endless footage from the first (and perhaps second) films. And boy, do they like those sections of previous movies? Sometimes reuse the sequence repeatedly. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that describes meaninglessly what we can see with our own eyes. The experience of watching this whole thing is really startling. <br /> <br /> Back Boogeyman is an example of the worst types of exploitation. The kind that exploits the audience in a very cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and to this extent because this film is not worth more. Nothing here is of any value at all. This is worthless.
