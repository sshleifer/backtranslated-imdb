Tarzan Monkey Man is a remake of a 1932 film at the same time, and like this previous film, it is very much like Burroughs literary character. But while Tarzan was converted in 1932 to Tarzan-Jin, Terzan, played by Miles O'Keefe, does not speak or even cry. He does Tarzan yell several times, which seems to have been sampled from the previous film. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays the second bananas for Bob Derek as Jane. Or, rather, as a third clone of the left breast of Bo Derek and her right breast. There is no meaning to this film only show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The motion scenes in the film are presented in a slow and very slow motion. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Strange enough, Tarzan has a side kick of the orangutans in this movie. He might have gathered in a car from Sumatra with the Indian elephants being displayed as well.
