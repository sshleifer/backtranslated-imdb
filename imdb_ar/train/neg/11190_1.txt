First of all, I have to say that I have worked in popular films and watched so few films that it is hard for me to find something I have not seen. With this in mind, I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made. It made me look like Gigli, My Boss's Daughter, and any other piece of trash you've never seen before. BeLyt must be away from his mind, I found only one person I liked, and so they could not tell me about the subject of the film. If you are able to decode this movie and you are able to tell us what it was, you must either be a writer or a knight because there is another way that anyone can discover. <br /> <br /> To love GD stay away!
