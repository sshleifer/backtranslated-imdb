You watched this movie on Flix after it was temporarily recorded. I grew up and I watch F Troop and it was very hard on Jane Wrangler, so I was shocked and shocked literally to discover after watching this movie that the decaying killer nurse was Melody Patterson, who looked very good but looked quite different and unfortunately filmed badly. I never thought she was in a million years. What the hell do you do in a picture like this? I agree with the players here that the film lacks what it pays for. No sex, no gore, no tease. It is also a new version of the atomic brain known as Monstrosity (1964 or so). Most of the work is boring. The main character spends a tremendous amount of time around the house of the mad doctor and the basement, the neighborhood in general, or being hurt by the policeman, all this boring and full of time. Now if the Italians were to do this, half of the film would have been Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam, who loves naked girls. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
