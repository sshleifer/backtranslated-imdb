University student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celluzi) suffers from the nightmares of the Ghoul who inhabits the basement in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting off his hand and spitting a worm and opening the bullock on his chest and roasting it on open fire. After his friends saw him climbing six feet above his bed, a frantic handy teacher (Donna Denton) points out that they are sneaking into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when there is no one to help out when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The group becomes stuck, Richard's brother Richard becomes a king and begins to kill everyone. Tony Bassel's fame "Mickey" appears as a useful ghost to Sami Mitchell, the lead singer of the "Bodybag" group. She teaches Alex how to lift him out of his body and perform rock music with repeated passages of the nightmare to calm the jogging time. All victims appear as wise ghosts in the form of Griffin Dunn's character in an American wolf film in London. The script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy. Good work in FX and nice opening credits (both from Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that gain any advantage. "Whip It" plays some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
