The premise, although not ridiculous, was that it was certainly ridiculous. What must have happened, through the second encounter with Tritter is that he should simply waste Tritter. The house rents some guy and removes the tritaire. In real life, Tritter could have been excluded from the harassment, and the rectal ring could be detected in the courtroom, providing motivation and opportunity. The hospital lawyers had succeeded in getting rid of the meat from the Tritter section and the special section for which he worked. He will be in jail as anyone accomplishes in harassing House, Chase, Furman, Cameron, Wilson and Cody. The suit would have won the home with a delicious settlement, enough to keep him in an old age. While Tritter ends somewhere driving a taxi, trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people retreat to the fact that they've seen it all before.
