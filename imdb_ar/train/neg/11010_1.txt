This movie is not worth even one. This was a waste of time. It was a waste of cinema and money. It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is the one I think everyone should read. There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only this, there is no plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are a small time, I've been excited to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason he was hired was Brian Van Holt (who only got fifteen pieces by the way). I think this may have been a mistake in the parts of the directors and editors, but they repeated the same slides two or three times, adding a new sentence only. <br /> <br /> A movie similar to this one is Eraser Head, perhaps the most disturbing film of existence. There is no plot line, not funny. Although they do not try to be funny. You do not see any movie.
