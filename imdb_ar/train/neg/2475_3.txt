I was disappointed. The film was slightly anticipated and did not rise to the hype that was everywhere. Having said that, the characters were developed well, the windego legend was used in a unique hypothesis and the house was very nervous but I missed. I kept waiting for this great AHHHHH or Boo! But he never came. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film was suffering from misrepresentation of bad special effects. Thus it appears to many bad things and not to use the atmosphere of the viewer and imagination to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you're looking for a horror film with a low budget but good design.
