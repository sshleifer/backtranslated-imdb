This 30-minute documentary made by Bonwell in the early 1930s about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain became richer than it was at the time (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can cause problems of its own, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, Better than extreme poverty portrayed here). If poverty in Spain receded, it was not precisely with the kind of socialism favored by Bonwell, but with Western-style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things in the film is: In one scene, telling the narrator that at school, children are taught Pi value. Teaching math to the poor, horror! Bu√±uel's shortsightedness is at its most severe here, and it does not realize that it is able to access the latest knowledge and technology, which will help the poor overcome their situation. What does it suggest? That children are taught exactly what is in school? Does not Bonwell understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor compared to other people?
