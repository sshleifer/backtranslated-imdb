This is not a boring film. The audience may still be fascinated by this selfish personality, Miles Berkowitz, the filmmaker and actor here. The story is simple: After a divorce and ten years of non-Hollywood work, the author plays is looking for love in front of the camera. The first question revolves around the validity of all this: what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no" portray M.Berkowitz as an average mortal being. If you are looking for a self-love fantasy like this love, I would recommend reading some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Besides this, I was very disappointed to hear a lot against my country, France . I know that the American people usually say that the French are arrogant (it may be true at the time), etc., and certainly the French (and the world) have a lot of sadness against America, but why this hatred? I do not think I do not like this movie just because of it anyway.
