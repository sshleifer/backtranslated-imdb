I have read all the rave reviews here and I was impressed by the imagination of those who loved this film. I can not say I found much to recommend it. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not only heavy but very bleak. The film seems authentic enough, but something must happen so it does not work, and nothing much: a flashy plot (not a real problem for me), not a great personal development, nothing objective. It just slogans along. Because of a flaw, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has moments of real admiration, a film I was watching fast again. For a great re-discovery of the West, "Deadwood" for HBO is far superior to "McCabe".
