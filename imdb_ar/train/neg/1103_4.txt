As a young black / Latin woman, I always look for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie in the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I did not. Although the subjects presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story is not properly developed. The film continues to appear constantly, and many of the characters on the screen come and go without much contribution to the film as a whole. If the director did a better job among the scenes, maybe I would enjoy it a bit more. Frankly, I recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" on this film any day. I just was not very impressed.
