This was probably a popular film because of its humor, the fast-moving story, a consumer character that closes all high voices, etc. But "white" is also considered anything else racist by computer police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harleyson as a white man who seems to be good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is as interesting as his main Wesley Snipes. Snipes had a lot of funny lines, which provided a lot of humor. The bad part of the film - which does not bother a lot of people - is the strong profanity here and the corruption of all the characters. This includes a friendly and friendly, played by Rosie Perez. There is no really nice and clean person in this film. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or to those who are insulted by the great profanity
