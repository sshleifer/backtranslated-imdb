Lord, what were they thinking? !!!!!! Here's the spoiler's warning, although I do not think it will really matter. You will not see this piece of trash anyway. <br /> <br /> A group of hand-picked carpets chase after a bunch of really stupid people, who go looking for really stupid to try to kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out of their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. <br /> <br /> You know that it must be so bad when even Mike and Bots can not save something !! They did not! I know that some of their lines were funny, like what should be added to the "HIT" tag and hand comments, but this was a bit sad. <br /> <br /> All I can say is "no" watching this piece raw. Not worth your eyes.
