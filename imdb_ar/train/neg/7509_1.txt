"Why?" <br /> <br /> This simple question should have been on the lips of every New Yorker during the 12-month period of terrorism invented by David Berkovich in 1976-77. This same word will surely become the same as the puzzling question of summer 22 with people coming out of the theaters that show "Summer Sam" vulgar and exploitative. <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee is weaving a story of a pack of mischievous thugs looking for a famous mindset - who hit New York City for more than a year - with a stern and formal portrayal of the killings, demons inside Perkovitz's head and thwarting the futile NYPD hunt. It offers a group of hateful losers who hear their "pulsing dogs" living a life free of love, honor and humanity - no different from Berkovich. In almost every frame the audience applauds me for "not one of us as it seems." Often criticizes the institution, and perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where Mira Sorvino, who is playing with a cheating husband (John Ligisamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "at the back of the big black Cadillac." An Italian mafia man tells a black informant that the famous field fishing at the center "Willie Meiss" was "lucky". "I'm happy because he's a white man who kills all those whites because if he were a black man who killed all those white people - there would be the biggest race of riots in New York City history," he says. <br /> Unlike the opening opening shot of her arrival at a disco (reminiscent of footage from Goodfellas from Martin Scorcese or Orson Welles "The Third Man"), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. He marches the characters on the screen stripped of human decency. Although we do not learn anything about the real victims of this terrible wave, Spike Lee seems to say that New York City got what it deserved during that scary and boisterous summer for more than two decades. <br /> <br /> "How can anyone beat such a ruin on his beloved city?" "How can someone show such hatred towards his fellow men?" <br /> <br /> Are these questions suitable for Berkovich or me? <br /> <br /> You decide that.
