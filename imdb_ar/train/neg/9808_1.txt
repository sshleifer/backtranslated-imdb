The worst show I have ever seen. The story revolves around a group of teenagers who, inexplicably, have super powers, and when they use a private device, they turn into strange, ill-designed allowances. Representation when they are not in cases of backward appearance is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst representation I have ever seen. However, when wearing their suits, representatives act from bad to worse acting; much worse. Extreme idiots in animation have a myriad of unnecessary movements that they do. Even when they talk, they seem to be suffering from fits. The bad guys are stupid of Rangers. Every episode, some stupid little villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends a powerful force of aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then start changing animation for 10 hours, then exterminate the aliens. Then, the bad-styled villain, who can be either the armored villain who actually looks and evil acts, has a creature that looks like a human beetle with horns placed on its back showing clear signs of mental retardation. The evil Power Rangers fights, and the villain turns to Godzilla, whether through a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they fire nuclear weapons at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants). Power Rangers takes 5 minutes to over-represent and call their own Zords, which are obviously games that producers used in special effects to make them look real. Power Rangers win, the villain's anger, they all teach a lesson of "value", and the show ends. This is. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fight.
