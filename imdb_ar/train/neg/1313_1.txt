Do not bother trying to watch this terrible mini-series. It is a six-hour cavity, an incredible love triangle between three people who have no chemistry at all. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It is dry, dull, elongated, and uninspiring when it comes. It does not even meet the level of technical competence expected. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
