For starters, "Hobgoblins" tries to eradicate "Gremlins" the most successful. This is bad enough but they are not even trying to make anything resembling a close-up film. Instead, it looks like a bargaining chip, removing everything to watch from the embarrassing scenes, the inappropriate sound FX, which acts like a unpopular tapioca, and a text that takes everything that people keep sacred in their animated images and casts them in the old tube. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr .... Children floundering are tracking Greek-like creatures from many movies before they kill people by presenting their fantasies. Great voice, is it? Well, you see this wall on the other side of your room? Run right at it, top speed, face first. You see, this is cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Fast, mention something else that was another expected customer. What other texts have the book done since "Hobgoblins"? The name of another effort made by Rick Sloan. How many characters do "Hobgoblins" do you have? We see? thank you. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I took too long to write about such a terrible film. Better write about more important things. Such as the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, this kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins", it's bad - as bad as the background of your ancestors, as bad as the pink flamingos in the lawn, bad like underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... I think we will stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots are fighting valiantly but trying as hard as they can, they can only do a lot with "Hobgoblins" before they realize, yes, the manager needs to kick. br /> <br /> real, real hard. <br /> <br /> One star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
