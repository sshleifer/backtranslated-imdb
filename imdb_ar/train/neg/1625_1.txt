When I was in school, I made a film about a couple walking in the trees and talking, and I realized halfway through the editing that this was not just a failed aesthetic strategy, but a cliche of Canadian cinema: an angry lyricist married to a vacant metaphor stabbed with social commentary. But whatever my failures in the film, I feel a lot better after seeing this ... this thing. For one reason, I ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content in it: every part of the meaningless business of the business here is fading for four, five, six uncompromising minutes. The men's lead is unbelievable only, an amazing creep, loud to the improvisational drama-level symposia that have been drawn from the U-T bar, which gives plenty of space to make it hate. It is recognized that if there is no such hole, the third act will be less logical. Some men who are thirsty for far-off echoes may appear to be quite useless for exploitative values; but this does not make it easy to see the cage crawl. Closeup until the magazine runs out. I recovered what I said about AUTUMN BORN, which at least had the corrupt and misguided courage: this movie crater will remain the worst Canadian film ever. At least, I really really hope.
