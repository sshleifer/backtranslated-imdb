So, the night concert was supposed to be a thriller and thriller. I was very worried and I was afraid to watch this film at first, but when I watch it, it is not a horror or a thriller. <br /> <br /> I mocked the film mainly in my seat because it was very predictable. You can predict what would happen next. The young actors were good at playing their characters, but I have to say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wisely. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will provide props for the scheme because it was good, but it is not exciting or scary. There was almost zero "jump in your seat" scenes. So, do not waste $ 10 to see in the theaters, wait until it comes to the DVD.
