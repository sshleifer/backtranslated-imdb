I will admit that I loved the first, and I was really looking forward to the result. <br /> <br /> You failed. The special effects were certainly technically amazing - but they did not seem reasonable. It looked like a caricature. Well, I admit that I admire 80% of the chase scene, but have you fought with Mr. Smith all? The animation was very clear. <br /> <br /> I can accept all of this. What I can not accept is that the parts that did not take action were nonsense. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in a speech that went on forever and did not indicate anything. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed by the small plot that existed. What the film did was tell us that there was no truth in the first film (except for the presence of the matrix). This film was very similar to watching a DALLAS episode where you discover that the entire previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
