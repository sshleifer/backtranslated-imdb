It was a bad thing, a bad thing. By the time the old lady attacked the old lady, I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed and choke C ** T to death with him. Avoid this film, a little good cinematography and some abstract footage, would be almost acceptable if I was 14 years old and I had never seen Gina Jameson naked a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend that you spend more time, for example. I would say that trying to cram a Lego home into your place without any lubrication would be a good start. I hear this film was not the original version, and I would like to see it a lot. It seems that this version is devoid of all the plot, and most of it seems to be nudity. Can someone tell me how I can get it in contact with Christian Phil? My life is back!
