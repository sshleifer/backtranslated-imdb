The first ring caught the bar considerably. He starred William Hurt as a contractmaker to kill a playmaker. We are provided with very little information about who he is or who is being killed. Indeed, this episode is worth noting because there is no dialogue at all. Upon returning to his own modernity shed, he was handed over to a pack containing soldiers, which gives him a smile but refuses and continues to do so. But on a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and about to go to war and drive jeeps and shoot with machine guns, bazookas and even helicopters! The special effects are good for a television program and become very tense because it evades the apartment using its intelligence to survive, and sometimes gets the upper hand and sometimes other. It will not spoil the end but enough to say it's a small clever development. This hope gave me the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, and the other episodes were all nonsense and I lost interest by the fourth episode. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixed bag and this is no exception
