Except for FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror, you can tolerate a lot of reckless and corrupt disorder, but this series gets worse with every picnic. I can not imagine how frustrating it must be for actors and crew to go to work every day, scrambling to get rid of these wastes. a story! Is this too much to ask for? Letter! How can we give a curse about the fate of anyone in these stories? If we do not participate, who cares if it is sculpted or not? Almost every episode ends with a stray bloodletting, which leads to a severe shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or why we have been exposed to an hour of bloodshed. Even Dante's efforts this season have had some disturbing sexual violence and have come to a useless conclusion. Ironically, the values ​​of production and its performances tend to reach speed, while the content is completely nonsense. I have high hopes in VALARIE for Exec product for Exec product, but we will see.
