Well, let's get to this point. We have five newly graduated students (they must be specialists in the word F) on a weekend camping trip. They run to someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set him on fire instead. A bunch of nice people. After that some patients start the disease - there must be something in the water in the cabin where they reside. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Well, when things get really bad, they lock one of their guys instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals do not like them. They chase one at high speed through the forest for several miles, until the truck collapses. Ten minutes later, he appeared in the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin realizes that something is wrong, so hiding in a cave to let this strike. Then he decided the next day to return to the cabin thinking it should be a kind of mausoleum. He feels dizzy when he survives (he must have thought it was a 24-hour error). Unfortunately, he was met by some unfriendly police officers. The other couple decide to have sex while the physical eating insect acts on its magic, and then the women realize they need to shave their legs (with plenty of skin cut off with shaving cream). Anyway, you get the idea. Nothing logical here. These are five people I do not want to be friends with. You rooting for the body eat bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were also somewhat entertaining but also totally undesirable. Ninety minutes of good life is lost here.
