This movie is similar to the cat and mouse movies that preceded it. (The next may look like a spoiler, but it really describes a large category of movies). There is the main emotional, wise personality, and his bustling but disingenuous good intentions with his bad attempts at humorous comments, initially hostile but soon relaxed by a wonderful lady who launches an "unbearable" love story, loved ones taken hostage, and of course a villainous villain opponent with his beastly followers. Everyone has seen a lot of these films already, and the "national treasure" looks like any one of them, with a little bit casing. It was easy to predict every turn of the story (and I can assure you that I am not the most sharp instrument in the shed). I was so fed up with the sense of deception for money after going out of the theater of a movie in Hollywood, and if I had felt that way too, listen to my warning; stay miles away from this movie.
