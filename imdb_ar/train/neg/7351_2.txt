Sometimes you need to watch a bad movie just to appreciate good movies. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This person will always be in the bad movies category, simply because the performance of Xu Chi was so bad. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel tells of Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who turned straight after leaving her lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years ago. But her past goes back to chase her while Chi Lam is kidnapped for ransom from CAT's security programs. In order to save him, her old friends from her orphanage days, and six other women, are calling for saving the day ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps the cheese is told, but this is a cheesy story. In fact, the full text and trend lacked any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was meaningless, along with a conspiracy that was as thin as rice paper in the water. If you can summarize it, take a bad movie from Jackie Chan, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a fantasy piece of work without imagination at all. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I have to give credit where credit is worth, and Zhou Zhi is perhaps the only person who came out safe from terrible work, as was her performance affected. Well, you can not say she was excellent - after all she had nothing to do with him - but she managed to exclude a character from her role. Other than that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lane had no other impression - although this was mostly a very brief glimmer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie has fallen into pieces. The scenes and the dialogue were totally unnatural and unbelievable. The special effects were obviously cheap without any attempt to clean the edges between the people and the blue screen mask, the poor editing that involved many interruptions in the fighting scenes and camera angles that were prim and unattractive, Which I saw better than a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a matter of too many chefs. Most likely, the budget was blown up by the enthusiasm of having seven children on the same silver screen. That left nothing else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way he made this film was like a cheap porn movie without pornography. Charlie's Angels, are not. In fact, while the sisters could do it for themselves, none of that was already clear here. <br /> <br /> Definitely will not forget one.
