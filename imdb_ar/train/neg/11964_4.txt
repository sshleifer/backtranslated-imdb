Billy Crystal participated in writing this safe and comfortable comedy drama about parents and children, irresponsible adults, and older, writing and producing. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), making him look for his scatterful father (Alan King), an additional film that portrays himself as a big star. The script is nonsense without Simon Neil with an abundance of one-sided, flat-headed and uninterpreted Henry Winkler (stuck in the sitcom mode) and a family conflict when ready. Both Crystal and King try their best, but King is very eager and often beats the top. JoBeth Williams has one of her other flawless roles, but she has been able to bring her glamorous character to her famous friend. I think it's a comedy, but it's a flash of tears ... ** From ****
