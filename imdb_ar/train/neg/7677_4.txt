I stopped losing in this episode because I thought that the death of I-Lucia and Libby was not really necessary and necessary. Then I discovered that they kept Libby about to die in the next episode! Jah! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show for the first season, but it certainly dropped in the second season, and found Jack and Luke's little religious feisty annoying. The death of the characters of Rodriguez and Watros was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode 4/10, because it is the end of my viewing of this great previous series created by Alias ​​legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series will improve in the future in this series.
