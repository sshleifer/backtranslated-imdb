Rob Marshall was impressed with Chicago, but Gisha's diary turned out to be another failure to comb Western and Asian arts. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after focusing on the bizarre scenes, some may find themselves fed up with it. The excessive cherry blossom, frankly, was exaggerated. Probably the cultural difference of perception here: Final beauty is not the flashy type, because the beautiful army will not be the western pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest drawbacks. Katayuani, I have no doubt that the actress is wonderful. The actor / actress can play any role when it appears. Gong Li is wonderful, but the power of the emotions she showed in this film did not translate into the Japanese style. All I saw was a sweet and bitter Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite representatives, did not even look to the Japanese. Some comments mention female-sensitive characteristics of Japanese women, which I can not agree with anymore. These are so sensitive that I do not even assume that all modern Japanese actresses are qualified for roles in an army, not to mention the Chinese and Malaysian actress who originated in different cultures and may not know much Japanese culture. <br /> Geisha is a good shot to excite the curiosity of the American fans. But it would be an affront to both the film itself and the art if the film won the Academy Award for Best Costume, Best Director or Best Picture.
