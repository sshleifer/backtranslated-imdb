... but this does not work and I'm surprised to see how many people they consider good. on what basis? There are some loose hints here and there, but the whole article is characterized by self-indulgence and unconvincing. Lynch films are generally interesting because they generate a sense of confusion. However, they are very playful when doing so. There are some visual meaning, there are some sub-schemas, characters, ideas, etc. Because all that must be explored is either "small", either elusive, or simply told by a superior manner. It's just Lynch explores DV, nothing more, so you have to deal with it this way. 10/01
