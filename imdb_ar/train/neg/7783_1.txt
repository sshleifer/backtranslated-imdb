Hey HULU.com Play Elvira Horror Movie Show late at night on its site and this movie is under the name of Monsteroid, good fun to watch Elvira's comment on this Crappy movie .... Enjoy with bad movies. However, this film has little value other than seeing how poorly the 1970s performed horror jokes, bad influences, bad dialogue, bad filmmaking. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While you are in the HULU, check out the other movies that are now available, there are 10 episodes and some of them are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480 pixels as long as you have a decent speed connection.
