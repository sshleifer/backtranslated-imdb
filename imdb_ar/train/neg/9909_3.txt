This was not good Western. I've got this nut walking around under the blazing sun in a buggy with an umbrella above it, killing people for their own reasons. You have this same person sitting in a snowy cave during a snowstorm, cutting off pieces of his anatomy that had frozen. Then you have some women in a house in the middle of a place where they are wolves are not there. What is the purpose of this film? Bruce Dern can not find anything better to do? It was a waste of the film.
