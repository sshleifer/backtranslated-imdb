I'm really surprised because this movie gets rated like this! I have not seen a bad movie in years. This was a really bad film. Spraying, not enough to describe unnecessary blood sights (almost ridiculous). If you do not like hostel2, Wolf Creek, or Halloween (2007), this would be ten times worse. RL Stine goosebumps. <br /> <br /> I can not tell me to act because the script was so terrible. Clichy all the time. (Why should I write 10 lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == Here the spoilers come == <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a butcher who kills people all the time in the metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one has been noticed. In fact these people are just missing. There is a good man who tries to solve the mystery (well, there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts the butcher's clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!
