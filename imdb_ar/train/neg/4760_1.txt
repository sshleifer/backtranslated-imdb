The rephrasing of Anthony Shaffer's classic play was short-lived in cinemas. After I recently suffered through this cable, I still congratulate myself on not wasting money on a card. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star / producer Good Lou have been deceived that their place alone can keep this farce in 93 minutes without end, without fun or the longest original class. <br /> <br /> Michael Kane has boosted his reputation by playing the second lead in the wonderful 1972 film. He seems determined now to destroy them by trying to advance, played in this version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscar, but lost to Marlon Brando at Goodfooter.) Because he is puffy and washed, Cayenne slides through the part less deeply than Batman's. He had already undergone a guest appearance in an awful new edition of GET CARTER. What is next - ALFIE II, or the son of the man who will be king? <br /> <br /> But then, no one benefits from this uncommon adjustment by Pinter, who believes that repeated insults and an additional sexual angle can compensate for the absence of the shiffer's personal interaction. Branagh's direction is based on the bluish lighting and stark design of the collection, which does not withstand a second-rate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the narrow close-up can help the law overcome its dull character. The result is failure in both direct drama and detective fiction, which often makes you forget behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of original theater production (with Anthony Coyle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Seo Sen will look at this project as a bad dream. The late Mr. Schaffer, who wrote the screenplay in 1972, along with Hitchcock Ferenczi and many of Agatha Christie's articles, should be in his grave, wishing he could plot a real kill or two!
