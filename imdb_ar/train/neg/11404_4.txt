It's great to me that many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I'm not special about high-quality films, and I agree that from a technical point of view for photography, as well as for many picture characters, the film deserves a prize. But there is no meaning (to me) for this film actually going anywhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. It's a series of moods, maybe fantastic as such, but I want more than a movie. I'm looking for a story, a movement and an achievement, I did not find any of them in this film. Yes, poetry can be considered in the film. . . But there is a lot of poetry that I can not live with for the same reason: it paints pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Another thing to say is that it documents an English childhood in the middle of the century, and is necessarily limited in its universality. I felt the personal shock of what a young British boy had to live in, at the time and place. After growing up in America just a decade ago, I can say that the contradiction is enormous. I can not help but wonder if this disparity has some effect on those who review the film positively. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the entire film on his "cinematic charm" (which he acknowledged exists) and completely ignore his lack of importance to the nature of the actual person's restored experience?
