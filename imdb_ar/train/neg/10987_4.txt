I enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel "The Robber Bride" and was happy to see the film. A woman puts her police boyfriend to kill him, and his friend, a former police journalist, tries to clear his name by searching for the crazy dead woman's friends. Fortunately, the film script is working to fix Mrs. Atwood's clumsy plans by focusing on the story of these two men, the victim of the schematic women ... <br /> <br /> Hey. Well, you got me. If these people are mentioned in the book, and I am sure they are fully qualified for the film, I will eat the dust cover for my cover copy. It is clear that the three main characters in the novel are not enough to carry the film. Zenia manipulation is not interesting unless we see it happens to a man, and the man's life is tight. Rose, Charis and Tony tell their stories to a man. Because it is not important if the man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It is painful to see them pushing to the side of a man's story. I usually do not look for feminist angles on the media, and try to enjoy the movie as it is. If I did not read the book, I enjoyed the film a lot. So if you love the cop and the former cop, and you want to read more about them, then you are lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy the luscious prose and characterize the layers skillfully through a plot. It is the same plot: the film has been excavated, settled and sprayed with male concern. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
