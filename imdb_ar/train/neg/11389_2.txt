If you like movies that go around with a small sex-spiced plot gallery, this movie is right for you. On the positive side, the main actress / actress (the new transgender) enjoys an interesting presence on the screen, but not enough to add up to more than just an impressive film - if that. Basically this film is about 3 socially ostracized (transgender prostitute, male scammer, and Russian gay immigrant) who somehow developed a bond. Why is unclear. We are expected to accept that these non-core people are the most honest and decent people who have the ability to love while embracing their bodies on the street. right!! Anna Nicole Smith really loved her ninety things from her father! The director shows an angry and unpleasant aspect of life, while he wants us to believe all these seriously dangerous people to the extent that they have a Troy administration that helps them live. Just a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a real look of life on the lateral side. In short, no plot, no truth, no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless of course you just love to enjoy it!
