I am probably one of the few who have already read Stephen King's book, the film on which this film was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the film, I was very disappointed. The only thing this film shares with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is placed in a game show. The main goal is to survive. But it is not in the arena. He started out in the city and had to run away from the show (I think you would call him) the bad guys who do not resemble the characters of the film at all. This hypothesis was built a lot of tension and commentary and ended largely with its climax. The film was absolute trash. There was no cinematic quality for that. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as a representative, but he spoiled it.
