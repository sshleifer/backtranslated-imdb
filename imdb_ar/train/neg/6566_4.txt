I watched this movie after having encountered a lot of trouble downloading it through forums. I have to say, it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Barinda was so volatile that I was looking forward to seeing him. <br /> <br /> Barinda is one of those films that fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite having a wonderful story. It was even more pathetic that the story itself was not original, but was based on the classic "On the Waterfront" rule. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. The direction of quality lacks several times, except for some internal scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this text to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a great movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It was not good enough.
