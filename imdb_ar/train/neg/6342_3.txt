I took this in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like this, go to f & ^% yourself!") In the box ... sounded like a ringing support .... I was expecting something a bit more like "Proof of Death "... is not really substantial violence in this person, conspiracy, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the label. Everything is there. Erotic works, rocks. Go back and forth. A week or so in the life of the Los Angeles band offers a dramatic magic show, at a level you might see in one of the little casinos off the bar, a new Australian stunt in town finds his feet ... They work, meet girls, party. end of story. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the band needed all these things because they were in second place frankly and played a style that was already dated in 1978. It must be said that the real pieces in the film are aware that the Australian colleague is really something , And the film seems to be driven largely by love and respect for "art." I hung there to see what madness he would do next. I just wish he had found a better car.
