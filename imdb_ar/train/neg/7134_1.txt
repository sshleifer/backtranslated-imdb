So it has come to this. Expensive cars are expensive that will only be driven by 1% upper. The girls who form beside them in the magazines of Gerhard. Second-class actors without a name. Cheap promotional features by people of specialized culture. <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood's trash. Do not get me wrong. I like the flick about working with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, will you stop the collective Braintrust that highlights these things, please stop, count back to ten, breathe, and have "Woooooosaaaaaa", then rewind twenty years and remember what made the movies enjoyable once in a while? Then actually make some movies like this again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop culture explosion I have enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother now think Maverick (not this half of them will even get this reference). Some executives said, "Hey, what demographics do you want to get rid of at $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, market 18-35." "Well, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Great idea sir." The result? A film I saw one hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not misunderstand me, I'm not a movie fan. My high-tech works, such as The English Patient, do not float on my boat, but the general films that were supposed to be made directly to DVD do not bother my hell either. Only the gears of the gears are the ones that will drive their engines through it, and I imagine that those in the top end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.
