Have I ever seen a more incompetent film? I can think of much that equals this one, but nothing can overcome it. Cast is all the terrible stereotypes filled with flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in making this. Each wears an expression of fear that is not caused by the plot, but by the realization that this project can easily leave their careers. So many of Mrs Diaz's charm do not provide enough reason to subjugate yourself to this. To avoid this, it is clearly a cinematic style that Americans have not really understood. See the end result if you have to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but not less that I did not warn you ...
