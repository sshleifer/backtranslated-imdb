This movie contains all the elements to be a smart, glamorous comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass way. Perhaps she did not really know who her audience was; but it was hardly a film for the man because of the plot and the plot, yet it was an absurdity and an idiot of poets so as not to attract women entirely. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a blonde legally and supplement her, then this is like a horrifying sequel sequel. Major actors like Luke Wilson should expect better materials. Jessica Simpson could have managed a lot. Rachel Lee Cook and Penelope Anne Miller play a role in supporting silly roles instead of entertaining. <br /> <br /> Many of the things in this film were numbers by number, different uber-clich√© tunes, the last minute "misunderstanding", even the children's party chaos. This suggests lazy text writing. <br /> <br /> You can find this movie interesting if you do not take it seriously, but it is very hard to be frustrated and disappointed as the scenes roll past.
