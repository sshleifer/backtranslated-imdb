Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 to rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the greatest regret of my life. Whoever has already thought of this film, or financier deserves a kick between the legs, because that is where they were thinking when they made this film. It is about a person who is overweight, a hopeless romantic, and writes a group of buzzing leadership trying to turn into poetry. He joins his strange friend on a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls as well. Only the chubby guy does not get a girl. Skin clicks do not bother me, I take their nominal value. But this movie tries to be more than a flick. It's about a fat person looking for love in some girls, but then meets another girl with silicone bikini enjoying his hair. He finds his talent in volleyball that gets money for his family and impresses ladies, he only has his mistress anyway. The dialogue is so terrible even for film C. It supports many black stereotypes, there is no evolution of personality, it is a pornographic film glorification, without any pornography in it. Never watch this movie ever.
