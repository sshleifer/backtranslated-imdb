Wow, this one sucks. I will summarize them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Count invites 4 naive punks to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some soft and attractive sex scenes occur. Some girls cut their heads (outside the screen) - the end. <br /> <br /> The only things that will make this girl are collections, fashion with decent appearance, some bad dubbing that lead to unintentional funny dialogue and a few nudie shots brief. Believe me - these things are not enough to recover 90 minutes of this movie. In fact, the best of it is the beginning of the distributor, which features some of the gothic snakes in a blood-soaked hook and shows the breast - and again - this certainly does not deserve the price of admission to the trash. As everyone has noticed, the title of the film is completely meaningless - because there is no blood spilling or dancing of any kind in the film at all. He was also dubbed "The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk", and then at least he would have won a better title that does not belong to anything in the film. The exact title was "90 Minutes of Torture," another seductive title that was at least honest ... for the viewer. Frankly, the trailer on the disc shows the best parts (and I use the term "best" too loose ...) so I suggest you watch it instead if you're still curious. I can not imagine anyone who likes the movie debris - please take my advice and leave this on the shelf. 10/02
