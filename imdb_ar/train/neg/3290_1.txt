Sucked this movie! They took something from my childhood and raped him in an outside building! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and grabbed the DVDs "Dukes" and I cried at the corner. The cast was terrible! It was not the Dukes, Steffler and Jackas were driving a car. When was the evil Boss Hugh? When was Rusko a strong man? They have never been! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rusco was a fool. When does Jesse smoke pot? he did not do! Now do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal, and there is nothing wrong with a small shiba, but he had no place in this film! The only good thing about this movie trailer is before the credits end of the movie. It was a waste of time, money and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
