An old man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse and seems to wither. Destroy it or bite it with something. Soon he gets ill, and in the hospital spits a large white larva of some kind. A subsequent attempt to revive him with the shovels leads to blood splitting. <br /> <br /> A policeman is in hospital because his partner was badly injured in an exchange of fire. In some way, the policeman is associated with a doctor, as well as an insect specialist brought in. There are many young children who walk around the hospital, and I assume we are supposed to find adorable, but we are a little teased. This happens to roam the room where the sample is kept, and the growth hormone secretion occurs. The logic of horror films may say they deserve death for this, but they have never been at risk. <br /> <br /> The creature grows and begins to multiply. People flee from it, sometimes towards it for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by soldiers ready to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the movie, and people seem to be looking for the monster most often. It was fairly boring. She clearly owes something to strange films, where the monster is born within a human being and has several stages of its growth. There is also a character called Bishop, whose main actress is Sigourney Weaver.
