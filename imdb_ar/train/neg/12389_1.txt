Fashion model Chris McCormack (Margo Hemingway) was brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) and her sister Cathy (Mariel Hemingway). He was put on trial but was completely free. Then Kathy is raped! <br /> <br /> A rape film is satisfactory and satisfactory. This film was announced as an important drama dealing with rape. What a badly written drama (for the most part) behaved badly. She is supposed to be sympathetic to the rape victim, but she is pushing the scene in our face. To be absolutely honest, Hemingway's behavior is so bad in this sequence that he loses any real influence he may have. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. The film went very far when Mariel was raped at the age of 15 (fortunately it was not shown). I admit, however, that it led to a magnificent end when Margo grabbed a gun and shot Sarandon. But seriously - the rape of a young girl is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. For example, Margaux was not represented. She was definitely a beautiful woman (and a real model in my opinion) but her behavior left much to be desired. It reduces the film. Mariel was fine but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. It was not bad, but the terrible scenario was working against him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that when this movie was shown in 1976, some women stood up when they killed Sarandon, so maybe this works with some people. I found this boring, simple and really sick. 1 along the way.
