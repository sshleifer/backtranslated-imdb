Nothing will destroy the film as much as it leads to a combination of weak text and bad direction. This is the case with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> The script is the lingering ideas of the old world's best horror flicks like Dracula and Frankenstein. The trend is vulgar and meaningless. Representation is average. Even Khaniz Chani is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand", and the producers are enamored enough to add much better footage of Christie Kappan and illustrate their film's weaknesses! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this film was, and then rephrased it from the beginning two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better screenplay and a better director. The result is probably the best film in the film's "Mummy" four, although it is not close to the quality of the original Karl Freund film of 1932. <br /> <br /> Cabanne's photos raise this movie to 3. He 2 perfect. Dick Furan and Wallace Ford may have been happy to see their characters collide, so they will not have to appear in such a situation anymore!
