I just watched this movie yesterday ... I can not believe reviews on this site. Those who give it more than one star must be fanatics of Buffy. Well, I'm impressed with Buffy's first class, but I know crap when I see her. On each level, this movie is terrible. Technically, you often do not know where you are in this movie, even within a single scene, it moves to POV as crazy for no reason. There is no logic at all in cinematic terms. Emotionally it is bleak for a bleak and trying to be a suspense film myself when it's just confusing. Throwing bad red necks into your film is a cheap way to transport the "atmosphere". She had run out of patience long before the last job, but I had a lot of fun with my MST3K competitors. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had two successful titles, even if you can include "Scooby Doo" on your resume. Gilar is a fantastic actress, but she (or her agent) certainly can not find her car. Mr. Shepard, if you are having trouble repaying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to appear in a movie like that again! (Also, the legacy of Patsy Cline must sue for defamation!)
