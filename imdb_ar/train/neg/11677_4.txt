Critics have spoken about this to death by critics when it was not wonderful. Certainly, "CHAOS" and "MAN INSIDE" are the same movie literally, with variations in suspense. But I found the program "CHAOS" more fun because it was a fast paced movie like the silly "Swordfish". The reason why this movie is more common is that it was shown in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide in foreign film festivals and theaters, but no distributor was found in the UK and USA <br /> It is true that This film offers a lot of tribute to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's good to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch it if there is nothing else on TV, but you may feel bored after a moment.
