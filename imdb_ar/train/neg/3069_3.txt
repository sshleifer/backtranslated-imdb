YUK! And again I say ... damn it! The original version of this film was a well-directed story of a man who had already died and was driving through torment. The original film had a lot to say and did not stop saying. They had a shark on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version surprised me as something that a producer bought his rights and then abandoned him without interest. It seems as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit in with the 1990s and changed races and races just to be nice. The film is not about exhaustion about to commit suicide at the last challenge. It's about a man trying to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this movie to make it angry ...
