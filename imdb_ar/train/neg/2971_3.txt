Batman the mysterious of Batwoman,, in a word, meaningless. <br /> <br /> The plot indicates that a mysterious woman ("Batwoman") sneaks into Batman's meadow, and while Batman tries to fight the Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne trio, he tries to find out from the mysterious Batwoman. <br /> <br /> There's nothing amazingly wrong about this, but there's nothing really special about it either, though it's always made unclear. <br /> <br /> The Fantasian mask convinced Bruce's long-lost love story and anarchy with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a major event in Mr. Friz's life. <br /> <br /> Even the Batman Beyond movie, Return of the Joker, is deeply engraved with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But the secret of Batwoman was he had some secondary subdivisions, much of the formula topped by a medium-sized fixed piece on a boat trip. Frankly, this is more than the Scooby Doo of Dark Knight, and lacks the punch and bite that the animation series carried.
