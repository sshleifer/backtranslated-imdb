I saw it for the first time when I was 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague scheme of what had happened. It is now clear, 15 years later, that I remember everything with great accuracy because it seems that the book did not go beyond the outline of the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no personal development, no background story, no personal arches, nothing. Good people do things because they are good, while bad guys do things just because they are bad. An unintentionally hilarious part is when someone you think is important dies and no one cares about it at least. They ignore their shoulders and move forward. There is hardly any dialogue. If you cut scenes of fighting and ongoing scenes, you will lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see some good animation and for any other reason. Or if you want to look at the hotly clad little chicks (or the crisply dressed cardboard men).
