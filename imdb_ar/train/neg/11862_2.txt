Perhaps this film has some potential for something; my puzzlement is how these unusual and unfamiliar themes continue to reach theaters, as if ideas are being recycled for generations. Truly that the dark sun rays that lag behind most of the films resemble dogs, they return to absorb their own vomit. Well, they've become $ 19 richer now because of me. It was not a fantasy at all, there was no recovery moment, nothing funny was shown remotely in the trailer (nothing was fun in the trailer), and the performances were tense (especially Molly, quite unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic satisfaction is a homogeneous friend with a tendency to Disney movies; none of the measuring instruments came to the house, his small moral speeches were flat, and I literally waited to keep saying something meaningful, just to know that it had been. The so-called "steel 10" is the most obvious plastic creature present (apart from having a horse-like face with a strange smile); I honestly found that her friend Patty (referred to as hamburglar) looks much better than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that the society is superficial and if love is real it transcends all social interfaces; the way they showed it, His hatred and beating him to death a million times (with clear hints of American pie and happiness - the last to remove the disgusting feelings) family dog). I feel as if the film was like the silly jokes next door in a miserable useless ball of raw sewage. Go to the marketing show can push anything out there, shine any stinky block and call it golden, people will come (they worked for me). Been with tirade.
