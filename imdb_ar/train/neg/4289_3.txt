Teaching a small tree is not as good as it could have been. Little Tree is about things like life's circle and how you should look at a star to help you. All that happened to three r? Read "Retin" and "My Account"? When the idiot talks about the teacher at the boarding school, he begins to cry and talk to the sky. My God. Sure, the lady was a bit harsh, but the character of James Cromwell comes and takes him away, leaving the public thinking that Little Tri was absolutely right. Must learn to adapt to the new discipline. Those were the times! Talking to a star will not change anything! Little Tree needs to learn that his guardians are not always right.
