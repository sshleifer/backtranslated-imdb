Recognizing the existence of fantasies about Brad Pitt is a very harsh confession for the other sex. But what can I tell you? Maybe this is the famous extra thing that everyone talks about and makes the star a star. Cross this barrier. It draws you to an unknown sensory and emotional area. Brando had it in their real names, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course, and more recently Tom Cruise, Lou's presence, Johnny Depp, Ioan McGregor and Billy Crowd. The women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Charlotte, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and, most recently, Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt redefined the concept unilaterally. It's the only reason to get out, get into the car, find parking, buy tickets, popcorn and go to the theater to watch "Troy". If you like the saga of Jupiter's Darling, you might enjoy it. But if you do not, keep it going, we want to keep Brad Pitt at work.
