This "movie" is a bad job! Nothing seems to be trying to be realistic. The scheme is weak, acting - miserable, actors around him wonder as in production in the first year, and trying hard to act without any chance at all from the start. What a flipping! What a waste of time, money and effort for all concerned including the public. Well, as in any thriller film, here are also murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine a person who committed a murder with a knife 5 minutes ago, and came out of quiet and smiling, not to mention hygienic cleanliness, as if the cut of the throat was done by a virtual client. Also, this murder was supposed to be by a fragile little woman on a strong male, and she cut off his throat !!! Did you politely ask him to bend over? Being so stupid of the same kind, leaving the public wondering if this meant being a joke turned into a bad joke. Continuity is another big problem for example: the hungry groom is keen on the bed, waiting for his virgin bride to emerge from the bathroom and after a long time, he falls asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the couple entering the reception area and asking for the landscaping! Not a word about another night ?? This is a waste of time even to try to write about this "movie" supposed to be low.
