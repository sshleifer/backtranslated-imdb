Evil Breed is a very strange bitter flick, which unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the film looks promising, but it is generally a disaster. The dialogue is very bad, but it is not as bad as acting. The act is brutal and unbearable. The characters deliver the lines horribly, and even if it is intentional, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the dead are innovators, but it took a very long time to reach them. After about half an hour during the film we got the first death (other than at the beginning) and then almost every character is smoked within the next five minutes. Then the film turned into a kind of parody with silly characters, karate like unreal battles, and a scene in which a man pulls out of the intestine of the * sscrack. Nothing funny, it's just ridiculous. The film then becomes very passionate and useless. Most characters are vulgar even for shaded standards and be tough leaving it on the table for 5 days. Evel Pride is not so bad, so he fails in his main mission. Watch the Texas Shainsu massacre, just before dawn, or do not see any evils of a real condition.
