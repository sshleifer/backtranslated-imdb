The first film is very good. This is so bad. <br /> <br /> Recycles lots of footage (including opening credits and closing title) from Criminally Insane. The new footage, filmed on a video, clings to it badly. The viewer lacks proper lighting, and sometimes the sound is almost inaudible, but there is also a defect in the video, such as the rolling image and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequences, it repeats only the first story. Ethyl kills everyone who shares her living space, often for reasons of getting the food she wants. <br /> <br /> At least, this is only an extra CD on the DVD for the first CD, which also includes the movie Black Devil's Wedding Director. Too bad does not include Death Nurse movies.
