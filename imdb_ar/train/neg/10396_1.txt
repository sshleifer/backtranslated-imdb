As a cinematic director, I have a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was in therapy when I went home to "My Wrongs ..." (Not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead I choose the mystery adapted from the controversial director, Chris Morris, "Short Film Includes Scenes"). I should have known better, and avoided this blurry (and often offensive) piece of the scene. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is disgusting (especially since we are all aware of Maurice's distorted attitude towards sexual exploitation of children from his famous TV series, named Brass) and serves no purpose other than trauma. How this movie was named a comedy I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The suspension of hostility seems like a new idea in principle (after I was a self-animator, it is often an interesting and unrestricted view of the filmmaking process), but unfortunately this is not the case here. Instead, we dealt with some noisy schoolboy about the dogs on the film, before concluding that there were no really wonderful movies starring the dogs. All this is very interesting, but it is not worth a single frame of celluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie does not go anywhere will be an understatement. Depends very much on his escalating style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer unnerved and unsettled. His simple message - that a man must take responsibility for his actions - is clearly clear and not badly explained. <br /> <br /> The film contains moments of pseudo-surrealism - Kafkaesque, but in the end, fails to convince, entertain, enlighten and end up being irritated. If you want to see a really great film about short filmmaking, I strongly recommend "by Franz Kafka it's a wonderful life," by Peter Capaldi.
