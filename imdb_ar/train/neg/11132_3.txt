The documentary, like any film director, must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe failed quite well in this effort, collecting scraps inspired by Chomsky's wisdom from visiting McMaster University in Hamilton. Amateur footage was filmed in the video. Pasco's sole effort is to hold the parts together in an obscure title on the screen: "9-11," "Activity," "Truth." <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> Compare this with documentaries such as "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" that create narrative narrative material from interviews, stock footage, and footage taken. In the end, each of them presents an effective and insightful message brilliantly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only graces to save the film is Chomsky, who was handed over with indifference to the historical creed, and the fact that the show time takes only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's account of his experience with the National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as being more accommodating to dissenting views, while liberal orthodoxy in NPR of personal interviews and restricting messages is largely permitted. There is another media outlet that should be skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is directed only at Naomi Chomsky's faithful.
