I, like many Bachchan lovers, were eagerly waiting to reproduce Shulaee. This film was not. Thank God they did not allow them to use the name "Shula" in the title of the film. Ram Gopal's new edition is not worthy of the title. The camera, the sites, the fashion, the dance are quite out of place, and the dialogue is combined to produce the worst film I've ever seen. You wonder if the representatives of the actors agreed to produce this film because they needed money Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money to the actor's only unpaid actor, Ant, is the only resemblance to the first film. Your father's role was absolutely ridiculous. Did he need the money to pay for the ash wedding? Save your money, your mind and your time, and do not care about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
