After the disastrous revolution, this film was the last nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and thus the British film industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from trying to revive jazz in the mid-eighties and based on a book and a writer who was short popular at the time, and deserved to return to mystery. Templ looked for ages trying to find Suzette and reached Wonder People in eighth place of the long wonders of Patsy Kinsett. By the time the film came out of the post production, the jazz revival was over, as was his career at Kensett and he met the film with a film that was not quite moderate. <br /> <br /> The average will be too low for some of the worst / camp / the most pathetic business on the British silver screen you've been watching for almost 20 years, and the film is really worthwhile.
