Let's start by saying that "Joan Al Diwani" is just a pathetic film. I agree with another person who said "I missed the joy". Haha. <br /> <br /> The jokes were very bad. The performances were mediocre. There was a terrible error in the movie. Imran deserves quite a bit better. All CELINA JAITLEY did was detect. Hrishitta Bhatt was OK. Imran Hashemi was also fine. <br /> <br /> Man (Iman Hashmi) is a desperate man who wants to become famous. Therefore, RADHA uses and pretends to love her, just because her father is a music director and can help him become famous (because the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA for some fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and completely drops her gaze and tries to flirt with BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then, that night, ROMA can not open the door to her room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not, ROMA goes to ask for help. During her departure, the MANN is able to open the door and decide to come in and sit on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes and has a platform for one night. However, that night, Rome falls in love with him. That morning, they discovered the underworld Don (Mahesh) who sees everything. Donne loves ROMA and could not bear what he saw. Ordering them to marry and be afraid, Man obeys the command and ROMA Merry. Then, their marriage news ends in the newspaper. Man later discovered he liked ROMA after they made a music video together. Is now besieged between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is terrible. The songs of "SINI NE SINI NE" are a fantastic remix release. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also great. Men, avoid watching this movie.
