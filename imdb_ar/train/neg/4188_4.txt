I am a great sign for Neil Young's music, and yet for the glamorous praise that the film has received in many independent press circles, I have seen Geraldale's premiere. The excitement of my life was not short, because this mysterious story and the weak lyrical momentum left most filmmakers either asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the film began as a soundtrack, and the characters have come back to life a lot. Just filming sound. Not the best way to formulate a story. There is no real bow character, and when "important" events occur, the viewer does not care, because the levels of discomfort in the film technique are very high at that stage. The film is every song, and to that end, the characters eventually mouth the lyrics while singing ... This technique works in the first section that was performed, and insists on the nerves after that. This does not seem true or false, it is not welcome. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, where characters find one mood and play it all. Poor lighting sometimes. The only fame I can give to the film concerns many of the scenes filmed as a news story, but this technique is used in cinema today so much that this film did little to promote it. The soundtrack is okay, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad movie.
