"Fungicide" is probably the "film" inefficient, awkward, deplorable. Criminal representation, the trend is virtually nonexistent, and special effects are supposed to be put through the launch of a monkey with learning difficulties on an unarmed laptop. <br /> <br /> Far from being stifled by creativity, but I actually think that things like this should not be created. I am sure that the filmmakers will say, yes, the film has been blocked with a low budget (as in nothing) - but in this case, they should not be bothered. As it is, they have offered the world something very bad, and so enjoyable, so that only those interested can get the best shades of enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Starting a "movie" was not as if you were expecting Citizen Kane or anything. I was expecting a little horror in the budget with little creativity, a hint of fun, and even some energy. What I got is a film equivalent for a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, look at our anti-hero world, which works in the basement of his parents, moving a man in a cup. It is clear that such a high-level science is the end result of years of research. Then his parents send him to a strange place of a hotel type in the countryside to relax. There are some other people, who are simply too awful to write about. Anyway, the world drops the test tube on some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (F, I get suicidal just write down the plot summary). Our heroes are saving today by blowing up barrels of balsamic vinegar (by attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string - tags). Barrel explodes in an uncalculated manner with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the fungus. End. (Praise be to God). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "movie" (and actually makes it seem more interesting than it actually is). It really should not have gone beyond this development phase (which I mean by a scratched-up plot of land on a back in a color envelope). Someone had to really intervene and give someone a strong shake and said "no". <br /> <br /> These are "special" effects. Well, they're "good". This is CGI went crazy. It is believed that the bike pump is the epitome of modern technology, carried out by someone I can only assume. When monsters are not mushroom-like home computer graphics package of 1984, they are represented by representatives traveling along covered in a paper (I dont you). <br /> <br /> One of the most unforgivable things. The film is lazy. This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero takes his guns (la Clint Eastwood) and fails to stumble into his pockets. I mean, hey, a few acquisitions and he could pull them out, but just to leave them as they are - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that money was spent on this litter that was filmed by the camcorder. Filmmakers must hang their heads in shame and prevent them from entering the 50-meter range of any film-making equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think it is wrong for friends and family to come IMDb makers and post false comments and give stupidly high user ratings which give a completely inaccurate picture of the "movie". "Fungicides" is an absolute farce for the film industry. Mr. Wascavage is either too stupid or too cynical.
