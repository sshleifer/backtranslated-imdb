I saw this film at Sundance 2005 and I was surprised by how strong it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. It is supposed to be a "mockery" of two high school students making a documentary film about life in high school. The film was characterized by bad behavior, bad direction, and a lack of attractive characters as written, all of which represent a complete statue. I love good movies about high school, this is not one of them. The unidimensional characters are consciously "calm" although they are supposed to be pariahs. You get the general impression of a handful of people sitting around making a bad movie deliberately to show their friends, yet he has entered Sundance in some way. Confusing.
