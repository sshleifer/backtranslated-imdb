The film revolves around two stories: the first is the murder of a girl call, the other is a political party of the upper class. The crossing point is the public relations figure played by Al Pacino, as he witnessed the crime and instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the scenario is terrible without any decent dialogues and space to direct any sense of drama, the performance of each unforgettable: how many colleagues can be hooded like a strong and scary man (like "godfather") as the server (See also Donnie Brasco). <br /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become tired. These ages are very moving, because they make the public wonder about getting older too. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is only makeup because he can regain his energy in the church scene. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's good to have a very awful movie because it highlights the talent of Al!
