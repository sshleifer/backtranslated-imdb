Debbie Reynolds launches tango taps, and yes, dances her way through this wonderful film that has a distinctive atmosphere in the thirties of the last century. Two women, brought together when their children committed murder, tried to start their lives by running a small dance school in Hollywood. The problem is, one of them suffers from neurosis. Can you imagine this thing 10 years ago directed by Robert Aldrich directed by Beth Davis and Joanne Crawford ...? Nah, a house that would not have allowed Joan much of the screen time to pick her stuff, and I can not imagine that Betty Davis on the other end is losing her heart. This is a purely false piece of horror, written by Henry Farrell, who died (his idea of ​​a good "shock" was the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). No oz of honest fun in the whole lukewarm package. * 1/2 of ****
