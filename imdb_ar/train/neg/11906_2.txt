Watching the movie "Der himmel Ã¼ber Berlin" as a teenager in the late 1980s was a profound experience for me - "That was what movies could be like." Along with "Paris and Texas" and "Until the End of the World" still retains a special place in my heart and my mind - a testimony to the genius of Wim Winders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, subsequent years saw a steady decline in the quality of his work with the "million dollar hotel" and "land of plenty" hit a terrible low point. Gone are the pictures or captivating music. Do not look for or display great insight. All that remains is veiled political figures and statements, which are nothing more than mere cliches, and frankly ironic in the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Are things going well? Whatever the reason, it is time for Mr. Wanders either to intensify it or stop altogether.
