Because I am an independent filmmaker and a great fan of Edward Woodwood, I bought this documentary, believing that this will finally set the record for how talented and wonderful are actually. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing combination of conflicting and contradictory self-contradictory homogeneity. <br /> <br /> Where people remember Ed Wood Jr. , Do people really remember the guy's second cousin with a tape that knows someone who was on Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems as though at the very moment that Ed Wood is renewed interest, these guys are getting out of Wood's work! Just to take a mean means a person actually gave him a chance when no one else will! Fifty years later, I suggest that many of them abandon the fact that they did not get the $ 75 they promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a great creative director who knew how to entertain. In fact, that was all he lived for. You may laugh when you watch Ed movies, but one way or another you realize you're laughing with him and not AT. <br /> <br /> But I'm going back ... go back to the movie at hand. If you're watching a film about Edward D. Wood Jr. , You will not get it here. If you want a movie about the old actors bitter eccentric, this is the movie for you!
