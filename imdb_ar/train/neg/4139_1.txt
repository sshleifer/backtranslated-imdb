Well, look at the title of this movie. <br /> <br /> The title says everything is fine? The title is wonderful ... I mean, there are a lot of things you have to get into your head after reading it. In fact, you may be very careful to see it. <br /> <br /> Well, unfortunately, you will not see any of that. <br /> <br /> Just a bunch of bad actors, some leaking blood, some hot chicks, and some homosexual actions. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I think there are about 5 to 10 minutes of zombie and vampire ... ... from this if you want to see a good movie. Another get it.
