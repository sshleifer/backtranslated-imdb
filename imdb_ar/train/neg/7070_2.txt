The most interesting thing in the movie is the joy of the blue screen effects used to create the "disappearance" of my mom. They looked like they were filmed on cheap video, and it seems totally unrealistic, not even in a good way as it's funny that you end up loving the movie ... <br /> <br /> I did not end up loving this movie. Attempts at "fixed" shots were pathetic indeed. I mean, hey, if they have a budget flick, that's fine. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, BAD film has a low budget and effects. This makes for a bad set. In this case, such a combo created the fate of craptastic film, "Invisible Mom". If you have children, and your children have no taste, they may stay awake during all this.
