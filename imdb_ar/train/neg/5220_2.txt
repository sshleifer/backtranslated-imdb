A young geneticist who plays basketball conducts research on gene sequencing using human embryos. Hope to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He has been pressured to complete his research because it has not been published, so the university faces a problem in justifying its funding (I think). <br /> <br /> An experimental injection on a monkey died quickly. Then he tries it on himself. Starting a relationship with the only mother of a very annoying little boy is what prompted the search results. <br /> <br /> Initially, it seems to have no traces of injections, except for some new strength. Then realize that he has some memory loss, and starts to remember what happened. In addition, it seems to be very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is named Transition, it eventually turns into something else. You will not believe your eyes - either what is turned into him, or the very obsessive outfit worn by the actor to portray what he has become. Incredibly, there is another change in the store - the end of the film is really unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie is going to do is that Laura Jimeser is there, but she has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw a square of video for this purpose with a carved plastic pattern on the box. Maybe he could have some electronics in it at one time, maybe the eyes that light up (the eyes of the main character sometimes turn green in the film). The copy I saw in a box showed only torn marks where the glue stuck to the plastic that had been removed. The cover of the new box, if still available, was the only reason I kept this film; I certainly get rid of it.
