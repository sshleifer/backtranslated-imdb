This film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was not seriously trying to act in any form, form or form. He sucked outright. Nothing about the film was reasonable. The first problems were in the foreground - where the man gives everything of value to Salvation Army Santa Claus, but he does not explain why. Then the grandmother sticks her head in the oven - really beautiful, and has nothing to do with the film - it is not even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation for Ben Affleck's motives for choosing the house of his choice; there were no credible reactions from the family he chose; people swayed here and there without any reason to swing (eg Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck turn into a steep slope - She suddenly fell in love with him ... There was a funny moment or two - but it was rare in the film ... she desperately needed to rewrite another (or 4).
