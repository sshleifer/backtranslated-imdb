The film is a complete crap. We have two good actors - Miscast and Meat Chief Salman Khan - only to attract female audiences. The story is crap. Bad drawing characters. A story that does not exist. No modification to talk. Ajay Devgan is a rock star. It's a dream in itself. The film extends to the point of decay. The whole mess about Arjun who brought Mana to London, let him groping his girlfriend and let him not play in Wembley (Vimbley in the process of dubbing) is ridiculous. Salman Khan's highest acting or rigging is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this Vipul Shah product but this is not one of them. All the good managers seem to be the victims of box office obsession. This is what Moroni Media has done. It's another "Wanted" junkie with an idiot like Salman Khan who has no place in Good Hindi Cinema. It's good for Indian cinema where Titanic was working at Winter Cruise Business. On the plus side - I love Asen's character as she dances in Bhartatnam when she becomes Western-style and dances when the teacher does not search.
