Really one of the most horrible movies that has its session. I did not spend time writing one of these articles, but I felt compelled to do so after I saw this insult to filmmaking and I felt angry because I was wasting my time on a piece of weirdness to be honest. There were a lot of parts that infuriated me with total randomness and lack of feeling (eg when would the police fire on people with contagious diseases?) When were the hospitals in need of healing? Why was the man who discovered he was spying on his wife while he was traveling abroad? He wears a pistol while he is around the bed?). The characterization - as we were expected to expect in such films - was terrible (for example, the way the blond man did - I do not remember his Frikian name and I do not give a toss in any case - I completely turned on his girlfriend and ran away to leave her) All in meeting the horrible ends! The production was terribly broken and cinema had nothing to write about the house.
