Americans are interested in Drosophila fruit and if nothing happens in the scope of a typical ad, we tend to lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I discovered an interesting fact from this film: Someone should draw high-voltage columns and do it according to a schedule! And guess what, they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored to watch nightly ads late at night and decided to watch this movie already, I found interesting characters and very attractive. <br /> <br /> I do not usually watch that TV late at night, so I can not recommend this movie unless the dry paint is your idea about two exciting hours of your life
