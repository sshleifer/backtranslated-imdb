It is without a doubt the worst film ever created. There is no controversy here. that's it. end of story. The story is an eccentric event, seemingly made by a three-year-old child fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just plain stupid. It is inconceivable how someone can come up with something very stupid and I think it was amusing. Jokes are also completely lame. If you do not see this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If you are very curious about how bad this film is, please do not let me describe it. Words can not express how horrible this film is altogether. This is not as bad as being a bad film. Even those who have cohesion, if not entertainment value. this is. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story of Rot ever and multiply its level of abuse by 5000, not yet close to the magnificence of this film. After giving Pokemon to the film one point, it seems that giving one point to this movie does not seem anything fanciful. This is how bad it is. Have producers and directors taken lessons in films? Because this is an ideal example of how not to make a film. It seems that some amateur on thinner paint making this film. If you have rented this, please restore it and request a refund. Do not think about renting it again.
