Watch this movie when it was first shown in the seventies of the last century and hate, hate and hate! Easily the most prosperous movie I have ever seen. You do not know where he got my inspiration, but this is one of those movies that wants to shake people to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this film, but a very long silence with people who are unable to express what they feel (presumably). If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink, this is the right thing for you. If you do not have anything better to do for two hours, stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you will get from this! Yes, he created me a lot of really worthwhile things later in his career but I gave this thing a miss.
