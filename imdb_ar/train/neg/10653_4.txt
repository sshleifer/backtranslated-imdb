One two three four five six seven eight back, haha. This is a must, first of all to see the work out. There's a lot of work to show out, see that close-up guy you'll enjoy. A few years ago, the video was definitely based on this film. It is italic but without suspense. The end is very funny, the clothes worn in the wood facing the brass, Jesus, looks like a clown. Murder is mostly done on the screen, where the blood flows but is not bloodied. There is a lot of fighting scene also, hey, no one hurt. And what about the weapon of murder, which has never before been seen as such, will not spoil, you should see. As a threat, there is a lot of T & A as well. To guess who is the killer, you will be besieged several times and this is the best part, but what about the copper story in the forest, huh! But still because of his cheese this is still one that many would like to have. I'm happy because I have a copy, one of those flasher failures. But man, those clothes not to mention hairstyles! If you're in your forties, it's back to the memory lane.
