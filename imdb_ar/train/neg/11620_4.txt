We were given this more than 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and they provoked some thought and commentary from my wife and I. I have been acting and talking modestly and I must admit that I came out and I feel that I was beaten on his head with this God, God who and Christ is our Savior. No movie and storyline you do not need. If you, as I am, a Catholic or a Christian recovering from this, it will make you feel nauseous. The film did a good job of showing the fine line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focusing on what might be.
