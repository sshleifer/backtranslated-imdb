Once you reach the screen, they destroy all the smart life forms around it! But on behalf of its producers, I have to say that it does not fit into any known film category, it deserves a new class of its own! It's "neural drama"! It grieves and affects every single neuron in the brain of a person. <br /> <br /> It is the closest a person gets to a stroke without suffering any of them. It makes you unable to speak, all your friends are numb, your mouth is open and remains so, and the most unusual symptoms are to make yourself want to turn a blind eye to you and circulate. <br /> <br /> Such a kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind after I finish my trial is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
