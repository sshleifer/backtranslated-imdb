This US-owned opera, Knots Landing, has all the entertainment value of falling into the elevator. Each episode contained conspiracies such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not unlike the other dramatic plots of the period. As for the cast, I have seen better actors on a grain box. From the mid to late 1990s, "Knots" replicates his rise in the UK like Gold from Light Diapers. I regret to say that I had to suffer because my mother was a fan of the show and you would see it religiously. However, the restarts were few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said about "The Knot" is the tune of the signature saxophone, which was later used as the title music in the first sitcom of "IT.
