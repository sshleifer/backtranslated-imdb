I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a very disappointing experience. Regardless of surrounding background music? Who really determines the mood of the film? It lacks almost all the qualities that I came to associate with the work of Lynch. Images are boring, to say the least, and the dialogue is ambiguous and monotonous to be of no interest. <br /> <br /> This sounds like an awkward student film trying to make a movie more eclectic than an experienced manager's work. I have seen lots of amateur movies with camera action, landscape, sound and scenario. This film lacks almost all technical qualities. I feel as if I'm watching one of Davids' home videos, produced during the weekend trip with some friends.
