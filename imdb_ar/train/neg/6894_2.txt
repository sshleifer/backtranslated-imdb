It's sad when you can see what the film was trying to do, obviously it was far from the mark. Cinema students must take this as a lesson and a warning. A graduate will have an idea. He wants full control. So he writes, directs, produces, his own cinematic masterpiece. Usually, his concept is beyond his budget. He usually writes an exaggerated text filled with each line a tag can reach. Usually, he is more concerned with the great discovery of the story than with the great interest in working with actors on individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a weak film trying to create miracles with a small budget. It usually ends with a series of encounters (we can not do justice to them by describing them to the viewer) who feel like she wrote at the age of 12 years. It usually ends with bad-behaved scenes fail to attract the viewer. When you look at the judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it is the usual fare.
