What can I say ??? This film was so stupid and stupid that I thought it was a psychotic DRAG comedy - it should be renamed "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time, if you want to see (die! "I want to give your baby the queen of the fetus) Jennifer Tilly being a terrible owner then renting one of the movie" Chucky "Oh Oh," Bride Of Chucky. "It's fun to see the ugly plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly and turned into Ugley's female version of Chucky) and she has the rubbery rubber band and then you see Daryl Hannah, pregnant, Dumb & stupid; Jennifer Tilly Grinding up. Homework!
