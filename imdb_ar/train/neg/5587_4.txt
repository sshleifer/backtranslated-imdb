In addition to his own Tarzan series, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although few of these books were filmed apart from the book "In the Heart of the Earth." The only exception is the novel "The Lad and the Lion", which was shown on screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), a film rich in speech, fixed, old, slow-moving, and mummified, although filmed at sites Real desert. In fact "movie" is the wrong word. The narration does not move, but it goes fast in a sudden series of tremors. For example, at least five characters are given detailed opening scenes and then disappear. And the most frustrating for passionate film lovers are the characters that leave an impression of some kind (like the girl in the hall with pissed wine) but are played by players who are not credited! The pay-thespians generally come worse than the unknown. The only exception is the Australian actress Venice Barton, who provides a good description of the kidnapped harem girl who saves the young Master Ferry. It is recognized that most of the cast are charged with the awful King James dialogue that he must hear to believe! But the way this garbage is played is the tongue in the cheek, a trick that does not seem to have happened on the list of one of the film's players who have no talent. Director Jay B. McCarthy may have made that idea. In any case, it is sad to see the beautiful Kathleen Burke forced to trade with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her father) and John Hall (her suitor). It is recognized that Mr. Hull delivers his lines more faithfully than Mr. Carlyle, but this is not a recommendation.
