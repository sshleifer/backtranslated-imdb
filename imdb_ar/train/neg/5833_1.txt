Obviously, 3LBS is just a program that indulges Stanley Toshi as a deep and productive physician. Unlike the house, he has no personality, and unlike Graz Anatomy, brain surgery cases are not interesting. This program is supposed to be in a leading position for neurosurgery - but nothing interesting or exciting is happening! Not even the pathetic "hostility" between him and a competitor adds anything to the show and does not do that hallucination. In the pilot, there was a brief overview of the social life of the two leaders cap - afternoon nap! Boring and useless. <br /> <br /> This show is made up of pants, and there are plenty of medical dramas right now and it does nothing to make it distinctive.
