Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of rotten sludge from Troma. This horror film of the events is weak and stupid about the budget of some teenage girls who spend the weekend in a mansion. The assistant professor attracts evil girls to a strange scheme. To perform terrible experiments - using a brain transplant that transforms its victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of garbage with full heads featuring a lot of nudity and some cowboy gowns, not to mention the funny musical result. Awesome and the scenario is not quite coherent. Why this piece of waste is distributed widely and beyond. Avoid them like plague 1 out of 10.
