I really liked this movie to the end. Sure, it was cheese and it was somewhat unlikely, but my attention was still in the rainy afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical music institute where she struggled to catch up with other classically trained students, what did the main character do? Wow them with their understanding and implementation of this time honored musical traditions? No, she torments and slaughters the great Habanira from Carmen and transforms her into the totally forgotten Bob Brittany Spears-Winaby song. My ears are bleeding! In the moment of supreme terror, her teachers gave her a warm welcome! Any teacher not in the fantasy caused by Spears would have failed at once. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
