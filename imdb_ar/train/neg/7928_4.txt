In fact, the film is not a horror or a science fiction. With a very strong Christian religious theme, this film offers minimal content and no suspense. Second-class actors do inappropriate jobs by reading their boring roles. The only good performance is Sydney Benny playing the role of a mother ... will not spoil the film, it is either Christ or Christ. Avoid watching this movie unless you are a fanatical religious fanatic at the end of the world. <br /> <br /> Being non-Christian, I had to force myself to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review. Unfortunately, Sci-Fi was broadcasting this movie in the evening.
