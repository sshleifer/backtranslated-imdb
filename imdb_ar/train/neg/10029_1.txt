I had no idea what the film was about before I saw it because Tashan only had trailer trailers during his promotion. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it. "It was the first appearance of director Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the Dhoom 1 and 2 scenarios and Ibn Saif Ali Khan Ibrahim makes his debut for the first time in the film by playing a child in the flashback," he said. <br /> <br /> After seeing him, I understood that the reason they were not an appropriate trailer was because there was nothing in the film to display. The story was very strong, and even the 10-year-old could get a better line. There was hardly any movement, the camera was shaken at every possible angle, and it was hard to tell who was killing. The action was also mild and unrealistic, for example one man managed a gun with about 100 men killed by machine guns. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Tashan, he reminded me of three films: Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor English Horrible like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The ridiculous ridiculous jokes that are not so funny. <br /> I also heard that the budget is 40 crore, the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all this money went. However, if you do not like Dhoom 2, there will not be any chance at all to impress Tashan. The race was great on the heels and this is a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya, both of which are filmed in Greece in good locations but what is the point in the trash film? Even the terrible English Anil Kapoor could not save this disorder.
