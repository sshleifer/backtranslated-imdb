Haha! Not a bad way to start it. I thought this was original, but I later discovered that it was a copy of the King Kong edition in 1976. I never saw King Kong until I was 15 years old. I watched this movie when I was 9. Not to mention the theme song of the film by Elayyan. This is the worst effects of the creature I have ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a sacred gift of B films. Memorable quotes: "Take the calm and go to bed." "Put the yellie in your closet and you have the power of the Yeti." I remember watching this movie on the movie "MOVIE MACRABE" hosted by Elvira. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in the opposite direction! In KING KONG, the girl grabs and climbs the building, but in this film the building climbs and captures the girl (who was falling)! In the same year, another reproduction of MIGHTY PEKING MAN from KONG (1977) came from Hong Kong. There are plenty of non-glamorous travel scenes and automatic body parts. This movie will leave you laughing. It seems like I said, just another version of KING KONG. PG rated violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.
