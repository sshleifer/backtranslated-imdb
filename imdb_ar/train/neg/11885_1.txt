I will dispense with the usual comparisons of a legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New York character, because quite frankly, the comparison between the loser Josh Cornbluth is just an insult to any such exit. I will also avoid mentioning the instant irony of "office space" in the very same celluloid disaster. However, can I compare them to waking up during your surgery? It is painful to see you wondering whether surgeons really know what they are doing. Haikou Tunnel is the type of film you wish to have assembled in its early stages of production. It was tough to let him live, and as a result, the masses all over the world are suffering. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film ?? If it is already one? Not even worth discussing, but for caution I will do. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with intense commitment phobia, offers a permanent job. His main duty is to send 17 high priority messages to his boss. But ironically, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Great deal! This is not a story ?? It is a fleeting idea at best - an idea that must be passed by any self-respecting director. <br /> <br /> The main actor? If you can call him that? He is a clueless clumsy man, with chubby features, my hair receding, no tame, and a series of facial expressions ranging from making a fin to a normal annoyance. Where? Where did the director find this schmuck? What are you saying ???? Is the director? Oh, my fault. Playing yourself in embarrassment from one scenario is something, but I think Mr. Cornbluth is not convincing as a human being, let alone a representative. Rest assured, this is by no means an aimless assassination attempt, but I have never felt angry about having a representative on the screen! My disobedience was more confounding than the constant efforts of the camera between the scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to understand this leadership, Kornbluth will insult us more by "explaining" the procedure (the first rule of filmmaking: "show the play"? Show, do not tell). Who thinks this young man himself? He has no charisma, no charm, judging his t-shirts in Hawaii, and no sense of elegance. The casting agent must be empty! <br /> <br /> Supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom that I have felt, with one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts on a very funny look like Helen the former secretary, whose old boss has pushed her to madness, and phone calls are being harassed by her while carrying a flashlight under her face. This made me laugh at myself, but soon the moment passed and I returned to check my watch for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also a misnomer. Haikou Tunnel has nothing to do with the old form of Japanese hair. Do not be fooled into thinking that this movie is a "house of art" movie due to its apparent title or the fact that it only played in a few cinemas and did not get any money at the box office ?????? There is good reason for that! <br /> <br />
