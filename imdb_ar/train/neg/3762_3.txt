I got this movie from Blockbuster in one of those shelves that you can get like 5 movies for $ 20. I would say I got the value of my money in this. I was expecting a terrible dialogue, crazy monsters and fragile cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, there are two not bad ones. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad, though not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe you've watched a lot of low-budget movies recently have lost their perspective. There are some bits where acting is terrible, but mostly at least high school. <br /> <br /> CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought about when I saw him (I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man wearing a monkey suit was better. It was possible that the animations of Clunky would look better. <br /> <br /> So you might ask why I call CG the second worst part. That's because the worst part of the movie is sound effects. They are loud, annoying, and constant. I've been living in the camp, I know how insects look in the woods at night, and while they can be high, they do not deaf like wildfire in this movie. Usually the "background" sounds have sunk into the dialogue of the film. This is bad, but what I discovered in the dialogue of this film, I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The procedure was rare and tedious. Tension was lacking, and there was no feeling of sympathy for the characters. Talking about the characters, they were all cut off and cute cake. It was the only interesting interplay between ... In fact, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two lines made me smile big, but it was about that. <br /> <br /> Cinema was appropriate, or a step or two above what you usually see in a movie like this. However, he still enjoys the quality of "home movies" obtained through films made during pocket change and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and get rid of budget-quality clicks, and you see this in the dollar box, think about grabbing it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
