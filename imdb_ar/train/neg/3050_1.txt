Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie rated "bomb", I brought this famous stranger's friend to my house last night. I was afraid to be the worst to know her reputation and was as terrifying as I expected. It is a Mexican-made mess, called K. Gordon Murray. They contain horrible collections and effects, and are characterized by the dreadful Santa Santa that does not work in the Arctic, but instead of a cloud in outer space, which has little elves to help him make his toys but all the different groups of children from almost every country are there. The opening sequence, where Nick laughed sternly as he observed observers showing that all these children were working hard while singing the terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seemed to continue forever, without a story. It is clear that Santa Claus does not abide by child labor laws! <br /> <br /> In the end, we get some pretty apprentice trainees who walk the devil himself as he travels from hell to the ground, just to make the little kids hooligans and turn Christmas Eve Santa's tours into a nightmare. Watching this movie is an exhilarating experience, and young children must be intimidated and stopped from Santa Claus and the holidays forever. It is strange that the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, making it somehow creepy in the context of all the strange things that happen. This makes my personal list easily "the worst film I've ever seen", but I'm sure this is not something unique.
