Not one of the best Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two of the legendary Pokemon movies come to the story. You can see how powerful Celebi is, although it turns out to be evil first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also appears, did not seem strong. <br /> <br /> Was not Marauder strong you have many strong Pokemon at all, except taranitar? Maybe some fighting scenes with the Pokemon game have made it better. <br /> <br /> Ashe and Pikachu met Mr. Ok, younger, although they did not realize it. Misty I was thinking that in the end she did not approach. I've seen this in credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much here, the worst in the series so far.
