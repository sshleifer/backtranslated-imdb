This movie was deceived in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think the MST3K was at its best when this movie was ripped off. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad make-up, bad influences, chicks with tight underwear. Give it 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of make-up. The assistant says things like "Not you" that look like NACHOO! (Think of sneezing). It's just a poor speech. The long eyebrows are fun on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what "fallen guy" means in terms of plot. I missed some start though. <br /> <br /> What's the matter with this minimum of 10 lines of deployment?
