From the beginning, the political subject of this film has become very clear and heavy, so that the outcome can be fully predicted. A good textbook for script writing will advise you to write layers of characters, merge character brackets, and three verb structures. In this film, you will find nothing of it. The police are the bad guys, and thus appear as shallow and incompetent and cowardly. It does not seem to happen to the makers of this film that the police may be honest citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer does not get a chance to make up his mind whether Ned Kelly is a good man or a ruthless villain. The film begins with his arrest for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the door of a rioter, but we only know that he stayed inside for three years when we hear later in some dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many Ned footage and looks at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real duty to watch. This is the trend of modern films, and this put me off watching any more.
