I've just rented (yes! I've paid the money to see!) This movie. My God. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As one of the other reviewers, Ms. Colagrande, said, get out of the movies, please! Please do not make or show in another film! The lady has a charisma of cantaloupe. No, this is not fair for the cantaloupe, which is probably more. She does not know how to behave; she has a disgusting look all the time (she reminded me a lot of my younger sisters are always disgusted by Europe). It's not a witch. She's not pretty. There is no real story. Editing! There was not any, I can see! It's very bad when you watch a movie, and to get past it, you press "Forward Forward" on the remote, nothing happens! I mean! I kept screaming involuntarily, "Cut! Cut!" As they were thinking? Well, obviously they thought they would make a movie together and get paid to make love on the screen! Very good deal for them. A pretty rough deal for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw now ....
