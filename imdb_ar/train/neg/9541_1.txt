I assume that many people comment / review their first film on IMDb because the movie was amazing or terrible - I write because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the sequel of "Wargames" .. I thought the original was very good given its time and content, I felt it was worth seeing more than once. In 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this film. Computers, games, terrorism and military overheating have grown dramatically since the first movie appeared, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" has agreed to make them all in a big click. <br /> <br /> The film fails on every level to a large extent, but I particularly blame the book and anyone who has any input regarding the realism of the aspects of the games. The "Dead Code" was a flight simulator in 1990 with a few people on the ground waving their arms. In the meantime, Will Farmer will destroy about 7,000 orders - none of which affects what happens on the screen. Until the end "wins" by clicking a box on the screen using his own mouse that triggers gas that instantly kills 20,000 defaults (no one near the gas). Because it defeated 5 levels in 15 minutes, this RIPLEY (Real Life War Machine) tells it to be a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Although any child between the ages of 5 and 16 can complete the same task - the government believes it is a mortal threat to humanity. They say things like "He has an expert knowledge of bio-terrorism" ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first three paragraphs of a wiki entry on bioterrorism. So, it was followed by a long and lengthy scene of films with about 0.1% of the budget and excitement of any of Bourne's titles. They have about 1000 chances to catch him and clarify the whole issue .. Sometimes they are crazy, barely miss him. But at other times they create opportunities brilliantly, just let him go on purpose to follow it. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I was writing more .. But I've already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, best watching Broderick and Joshua playing tic-tac-to-to for 1.5 hours.
