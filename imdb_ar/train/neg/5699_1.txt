Wow, this movie was terrible too. I am very happy that I did not have to pay money to see this terrible film. It was like a history nut went at a coke party! The previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad. I'll say the idea looked decent but come on. It was really really bad. If you sit and think about it you will also realize that it is unrealistic. Come again the day you think they have all these things to work with. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a damn mystery. It was totally ridiculous, you want to watch a bad movie, then go watch this movie by all means. All and ALL HORRIBLE, may already be in the top 10 films I have ever seen.
