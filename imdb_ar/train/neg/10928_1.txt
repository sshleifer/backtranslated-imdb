I just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. The film was expected and slow. It basically bears the bad news of Mormon that plays the church basketball punishing it. Instead of watching this movie, I should have had a root canal. It was clear that the delusional offers were sponsored by the sponsor. This film has potential because of the horrible behavior that Mormons offer when they play a basketball certified by the church, but because it ranks PG, the true nature of the scene can not be transferred to the film. The representation is terrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thorl Bailey in the film was absolutely unnecessary.
