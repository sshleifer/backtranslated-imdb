When in Rome it is clearly improved in getting there. To get there I found that I was predicted and very slow, and to this day I still consider her Olsen's worst twins. However, when In In Rome is a terrible film, it is not a great film either. If I have to sum it up in a word, I would say acceptable. It's good fun for teenagers, but I think adults will not have much to do. <br /> <br /> When Rome has its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are in fact a very beautiful actress, and certainly very pretty as well. I will admit when I was ten years old or so, I really liked them, and in general, I still love them. I enjoyed some of their films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Returning to the goal, the girls do not do a bad job, but are very attractive. In addition to their clothes are to die for, the scene of Rome absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not too bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the movie is dropped in the plot and the scenario. The script is mostly clich√© and has hints of deja vu. The plot, like most of the films of Mary Kate and Ashley, is highly predictable, and anyone who is familiar with any other action of Twins Olsen will find some non-original elements. Most characters are thin cardboard, do not recognize them very often, and sometimes the speed is uneven. Unfortunately, the stunning scene is spoiled by the somewhat deceptive camera work, which seemed hasty and constantly. <br /> <br /> In general, you have good points, and you can definitely see them. However, for my taste, teen fluff is harmless and predictable. Bethany Cox
