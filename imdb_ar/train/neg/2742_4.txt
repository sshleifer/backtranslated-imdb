There was a stumble in browsing this movie channel. My first reaction was, "O God, not again!" She hip-up play delay these days has become a buzz and frankly blunt. For some reason, though, I stayed and watched until the end. Perhaps my faith was with actors, hoping to give me something to express. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Hill and Helena can work. Also, the film progresses towards something better in the end, and in fact gives way. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me by her personality. Jane has the average side that you use to keep the distance and repel the pity. Then again have a soft side looking only for love. The only thing that surprised me more was the character of the program ... This was a triumph of acting, and the film itself is not unique. <br /> <br /> Learn if you are a student acting ... If you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. It's Sean Bin serious! Oh my God, it was a bit harsh, he had some jokes ... not for escapees.
