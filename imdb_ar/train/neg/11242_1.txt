I saw this movie last month in a free sneak preview and went out. It was very terrible. In the very trying process, they acted too much and made a terrible film. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had taken decent choices in the past so this could not be far from the mark - but I was wrong. I was hoping to give a poll at the end of the film so I could tell them not to make that movie. I took the free side of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I'm usually amused easily. I have tried to be creative and imaginative through images and ideas of photography, but because they collected many ideas simultaneously, they failed. I do not usually get annoyed at the movies, and I do not usually feel the need to show my views about films, but I had to warn everyone to see them. I registered on IMDb just to let you know all of you guys
