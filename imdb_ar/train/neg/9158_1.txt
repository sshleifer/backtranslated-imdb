My God. I bought this movie and ... I watched ... and ... all ... something. . . Well, you'll be fine ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. Soon I hope to get rid of the appearance of the flash. I was eating something after the film, but I can not seem to be brave enough to try and grab any food right now. Bad? Yes bad is very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, the bad message does not appear to show the message correctly. They are ... there is no word to describe how awful .... not awful ... they are disgustingly cast / acting / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do but throw it. Maybe I burned it I do not want to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now. Worst movie since "Hey Happy"
