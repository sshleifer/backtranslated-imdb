The word in the summary summarizes the command "Oh"; five girls were lost trying to find their way home when they stopped at a shop for directions where they collided with a parked car. One of the headlights crashed on them, swallowing the scene in an exhibition of trouble, They see one lamp coming out behind it (Oh). <br /> <br /> From there everything screams and cries and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it from the lamp;), as well as screaming and crying greatly through the entire film (very annoying) filmed with cheap camera Trying to make it look "real" or "awful" I think, it's embarrassing and useless though. In the absence of anything better to compare it to Blair's "charming style." <br /> <br /> It was yelling and crying to a large extent with the entire movie in a curly voice ending up annoying, literally meaning you're having a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but that was not scary, Just an annoying painful piece of nonsense film.
