I saw this film with my rock climbing instructors, and we found it all so ridiculous that it transcends pity. (For example, if Stallone is outside the free climb on his own, there is no need to carry any equipment, but I think these hackers seem to be sort of "mountaineering," so let's take them.) For those who have lobotomized who think that Colorado resembles anything resembling dolomite in Italy (where the film was filmed), Hollywood diameters have got on more absurd and foul-smelling things to swallow.
