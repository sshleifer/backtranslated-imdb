Sam Mraovich should not be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested immediately ... at least because of minor theft. Any person who pays up to 10 cents to rent any of his waste must make a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of "work" ... I will post. Ed Wood looks really good now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of waste to the video store, I will personally ask to remove it from the shelf. I am an active supporter of gay cinema, I feel angry and angry because this deformed child, who was not very talented, allows him to distribute and pack something like that, with a nice polite boy on his cover (Jimmy Britt Gabel, who has no doubt other appropriations acting on IMDb ) And an interesting summary on the back used as bait, then marketed as a "movie rent." Trust me, this has nowhere to go. It is simply not a film in any sense of the word. Junk, junk like this harmless efforts to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those seductive to hire this because of the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel does not seem more tempted to look at the film as it is on the cover, showing once or twice without a shirt - that's all. Instead, the subordinate Mavavich follows us with his disgusting, disgusting nude figure. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that "collected" is a reverse project for Marovic. Both he and his friend Michael Habboush (who, as I understand, put a labyrinthine garbage) are terrible in this. Mirovich deliberately poses as a full force free of talent (in all areas), desperate to grab any "loser" attention he can achieve for himself. It is to pity.
