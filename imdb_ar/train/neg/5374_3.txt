The Crimson River is one of the most chaotic, most common, and most of all I have seen coming out of France. There is nothing worse than trying to produce French movies in Hollywood and CR The best example of such horror / movement / friends. I stopped working almost halfway because I knew it would amount to nothing but the French men who are trying to confront. <br /> <br /> The film begins consciously, like a kind of expansion horror movies, but it quickly turns the species, from horror to action to type x files to flick off friends, and in the end, CR all of them and none of them . It's full of clich√©s that at some point thought it was comedy. This painful dialogue and these silences of silence, with the gradual disappearance and fading in the right moments of the presentation, made me groan. I thought only Hollywood-made films used this vulgar technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene, where Vincent Casel runs after the killer, is overly directed and over-done to the extent that it is almost a beauty. The peak of the mountain, with the stupid revelation of the murderer (murderers) with Casel and Renault's "friends" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 hours, completely removed the little credibility that the film had acquired by then. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that the director of CRIMSON RIVERS has directed GOTHIKA, though he had his share of problems, but he has not come close to the horror of this overbearing movie.
