The film seems disjointed and overall, poorly written. The scenario moves as if 10 different people had written it, and none of them had communicated with each other. Obviously they wanted to take a page from the movie Miracle on 34th Street (the original movie), but it is done so badly that the movie breaks down. This movie is for young people only, and they will even see the fact that none of his books know anything about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels have died in another place, the owner does not seem to care, and does not bother him the fact that his manager entered into a battle with his jug ?? on the mountain ?? Or he played a team play by playing an announcer live. However, when the team is just one match away from the title, he bowed from a story (from a 6-year-old boy) that the manager gets help from a child who claims to see true angels. What seems worse? Violent loss control manager who lost his team 15 consecutive? Or a winning coach on the verge of qualifying that act a bit eccentric and help take care of children? The owner's reaction is meaningless. He moved to change his mind by Maggie and her speech "Directly from Clichy Land" at a news conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The angels are supposed to play with the division in the weekend series against the White Sox, but at the end of the game the announcers say the angels have won the flag. "The flag did not decide until someone won the LEAGUE championship, not the regular league title. /> Whitt Bass, the goofball jug is the first pitcher and wins the game that broke the losing angels series? So, is it the attractive start? THE VERY NEXT today. <br /> <br /> Mile Clarke (Tony Danza) The ninth is to cast 156 playgrounds in a low ball game, usually the number of stadiums is less than this, usually around 80-90 playgrounds. <br /> <br /> "AL" says the angel at the end "You have to win the championships on their own," although he and his angels are manipulating and correcting the games throughout the second half of the entire season. <br /> <br /> I can continue, as there are many other examples where the story is bad writing. /> <br /> For young children (less than 10), this movie may be amusing.It's too bad? Did it true it could have been a classic.It ended up such a mistake, a mess you can forget it will live forever as a UHF / cable Saturday Morning.
