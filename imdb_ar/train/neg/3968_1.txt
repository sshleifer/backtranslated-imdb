If you've seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compared it to IMDb, you know most of the comments and sounds are fake. Trust me: You'll be bored! The production team writes their own observations (sometimes they admit it). But this is not enough: they also click on "No" whenever there is a negative comment on the film. That is why negative critics always put these intellectuals behind. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad and bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad texts and bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you'll believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avent Bradley may be a good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who are still funding his films. (Well, it's cheap, but with that.) But as a creative person, it's a complete failure.
