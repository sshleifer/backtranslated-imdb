Maybe someone heard about Alberto Tomba. A former cop, a former Sky champion, is now a wonderful actor. Alex Laretti was set to be a "mini" television series, but Italian television itself refused to show the film on its channels. Now it is, believe me, a ridiculous film. The script is simply hilarious (supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 year old child. But what really blows you up is amateur acting: Alberto Tomba, who could not really be believed as a policeman himself, plays with a completely ridiculous character: an Italian special operations officer who opens doors. ("ariete" is "ram"). This supernatural man will try to save the life of a nice young girl (a little "little Italian" television girl, married to singer Eros Ramazotti): nice but totally incompetent in acting. Lose this one and make yourself known. A disgrace film on the Italian film industry: John Travolta has just approached Earth Attack.
