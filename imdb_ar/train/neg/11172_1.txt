The unpopular "I Love the 80" in 2002 was an indecent, disgusting, humiliating and popular culture that showed it was the first in a long series of hideous TV programs that eventually identified VH1, Real-oriented music left on TV! I used to live practically on the VH1 until spring or winter, and I forget what now, in 2002 when such garbage began to appear without any reason at all. Out of the obsessive curiosity (I think that's what you call it), I decided to go ahead and get to know him anyway on the first night of his appearance, even though the ads seemed like complete folly. At least I can honestly say that I was not disappointed because of that, because my expectations were at the bottom level of the basement at first. The focus of this presentation, which I discovered during the first five minutes, was less every year of the 1980s than it was or was not of cultural importance or popularity (which I expected to see), but instead was more than an improvised platform for a large number of actors Comedians who do not give a name from God, to show what they think more than others, their comic skills * rolled eyes ... ... like a lack if you ask me! It is now very easy to know why no one heard of any of these idiots before they appeared in this show because they are all very unsophisticated and pathetic in their attempts at so-called "humor" to the point that I swear I felt my bowels knotted with each one One after the other! All in all, I have no problem saying that "I love the 80s" was the waste of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I never saw VH1 anymore.
