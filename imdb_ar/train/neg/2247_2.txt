Chris Christoferson, at his narcotic climax in the mid-1970s, finds himself barely able to press on the screen, along with the loose ego of La Streisand's femininity and female femininity at the discount store. <br /> <br /> Loved; I was happy when the Ferrari Christopherson passed this hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stars, try The Buddy Holly Story_ (made only for a year and a half after this Drake).
