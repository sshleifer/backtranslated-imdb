No one is more fan of the Flashman papers for McDonald's Graser than Fraser than I feel. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see Richard Leicester now guiding Royal Flash, where I also see that he made the three / four knights. With Fraser which I offered well though. <br /> <br /> It was not Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie was shown and I could not have been more enthusiastic because I had read all the Flashman papers that were published up to that time and was drunk with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still, but really did not give a chance then). <br /> <br /> (I saw him again when I was about 20 years old on TV and it looked worse). <br /> <br /> No sharp dialog in the books has been moved to the screen. It seemed to me that the personal comedy of Flashman had been misinterpreted in the same way that we can imagine a group of high school students trying to parody. The dueling and fencing were terrible and unimpressive. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed to learn how to exploit the direct irony of earlier versions of Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with the transformation of Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg into fast friends and play a game invented by Rudi: Russian Roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments will be more direct if you've watched the movie recently, but I'm glad I did not. <br /> <br /> If Fraser reads this in any way, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but based on my appreciation for this work group, it is hard to believe that he wrote the script for this film , As did all the films Roger Moore James Bond terrible.
