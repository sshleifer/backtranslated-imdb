I just rated this movie as 3 of the sad because it tries to be worthwhile. I would like to commend a wonderful film and I am not biased towards "masculine" films. Blonde legally was an excellent film. On the other hand, the Georgia base was an unregulated, weak, weak, unrealistic example of filmmaking at its worst. At the end of the film, I did not care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is a good story. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep, does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic personality is a personal that is experiencing a major change in personality and is preparing for this change throughout the film. In Georgia Georgia, personal changes were sudden and undeveloped. Second, there were too many dynamic characters to try. Giving up a really good dynamic character is a difficult and time-consuming task (you only have a few hours in a movie). This means that many of the dynamic characters that have been tried will receive very little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story, and the scars of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say that I loved anyone. Every character was a mess. This is good if you write "American Beauty" but not when trying to make an exciting comedy. Georgia was either awful, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for man (no, I do not cut her from stagnation because she was harassed, crap for all, and we are all responsible for our own business). The child of the Mormon "Dudley Do Right" should have the courage not to violate his religion and his obligations ... Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of man is allowed to a 17-year-old girl who has been harassed to stay there from time to time (unless he is a representative) Or political). Worth watching this movie if you want to remind yourself what a good movie makes!
