This is probably the worst film I have ever seen in my life - surpassing the most awesome previous films, "Spawn of Slithis", which I saw when I was 10 years old. <br /> <br /> The bad representation, the silly and silly dialogue, the incomprehensible plot, the broken scenes, even the music were annoying. Have you left anything? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI does not make a decent film. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I actually spent money watching this movie. If anyone has Hyung-rae Shim's contact information, please forward them to my "gmail" username, and I will contact them to personally request a refund.
