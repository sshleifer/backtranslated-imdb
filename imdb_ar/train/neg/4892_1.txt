They have sex with watermelons in Asia. <br /> <br /> Okay. First, I doubted it, but after seeing the stray cloud, I changed my mind and was finally convinced that they had sex with the melon, with death or death alive. No safe sex of course. The leader (who is horribly ugly) unleashes everything in the lady's mouth after he has killed the dead lady. Have not heard of HIV? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is basically boring, but also disgusting. In fact, the parts became so disgusting that I could not leave my virgin eyes. Sex with the dead! How gross is it? What is the message behind everything? We need water, we need melons, do we need to be dead for sex? Sorry, but this stinks!
