This film was sporadic, incoherent and written. It was also a very enthusiastic image of women. I rented it because it is included as a comedy (this is an extension), and because the cover said Andy McDowell was rising in a storm. They were not. I watched this movie with two people, we spent an hour later in an expression of how bad it was. <br /> <br /> WARNING: Summary Earth below! They spoiled RAMPANT! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a somewhat planned plot of an elderly woman dealing with a younger man, strongly opposed to her jealous girlfriend. They want her to marry a dull man of his age who loves her. But she is very happy with her excessive gravity, which makes you root for them to cling to them, and certainly, I decided to marry the man. But her ugly friend, with the help of her faithful friend, is plotting to deceive our heroine in the belief that the man is betraying her. it's working. She has a fight with him, he went out of the house and crushed a truck (remember the title of the movie?) He has now died, two thirds of the way across the film. Although our heroine is a school principal who spends her time watching girls, she clearly has forgotten to use contraception and is pregnant. <br /> <br /> She has already cut ties with her friends because they did not have support. Alone and pathetic, she decided to marry a boring man. Did you mention that the boring man he loves is the minister? She asked him to marry her from the young man (Latif, huh?), But now she tells him she will marry him, and he seems to have no objections to circumventing him that way. But her friends save them on the altar and take her home, where they do not admit that they are often responsible for the love of her life. Have a child. In the final scene, they leave him in a bed inside her house as they come out of the balcony to drink, smoke and fail. I do not care for you, it's bad. I left the part about red herring cancer and ridiculous silly lesbian moment.
