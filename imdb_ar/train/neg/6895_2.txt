The plot is Rocky. Acting somewhere south of the high school play. Filming is not bad, but it seems to have been cut with a machete. I could not say that this was a deliberate flick or if the people behind him really believed they were making a good film. Think Death Day Valley meets Mayberry RFD. People running in a modern town "without law" wearing six firearms pads. It has more than its fair share of "cutsey" stuff. Images of "good men" arriving at an old farmhouse, and Ford Mustangs parked in front of a railroad. The writer envisioned a Western-style film (Western Hemisphere) playing a Japanese melody but with sub-titles in English. All this is really weird but may be improved when you watch it while participating in a small game. It's a real curiosity with modern similarities with all the western film cliches that you can think of. There is even a recent version of the good dance hall girl, and a Jewish harp in the soundtrack. really! If someone brings you home to attend a Saturday night movie session, tell them that a DVD player has died.
