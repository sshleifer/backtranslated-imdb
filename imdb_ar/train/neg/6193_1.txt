I can not believe I spent an hour and a half watching a weak film. If there's only one movie you have to miss, that's the movie. <br /> <br /> Robert's teenager died recently, so he starts hanging around with some local teenagers who are anti-social and drug-use. All these things make him more aware and mentally and eventually explodes this consciousness ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I do not think I can find any meaning or effect to the great euphoria in this film, not in any single character. If the director considers what I have seen in the last few minutes of great ecstasy, I must say that this is not soon. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature either. Most of the time I could not see any facial expressions from the actors and I did not feel that body language was enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was so tired they installed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is too weak. There are a lot of scenes and conversations that have nothing to do with which are supposed to be interconnected, but they are really so random that you can not assemble them together, perhaps unless you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In an hour and a half you may find less than 5 minutes of actual representation and at all other times, there are people walking, talking and moving. So I can not comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> However, I have chosen a great selection of music in the last few minutes. Maybe that was the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave a movie, but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch scary movies). This film about the date of a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets with a very upset audience. I hope you fall into any group.
