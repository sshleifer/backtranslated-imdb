What an awful film. I love the clicks of the monster, but I could not even see half of the horrible representation and cartoon characters and abysmal special effects. There is nothing to recover about this movie. The characters come either from an endless supply of fugitive suicidal cannon fodder or puppeless puppet puppets. The plot is a formula, cut and paste, and a standard set of science run by AMOC. Even CGI is terrible. You know it's bad when you can not rely on the film to provide good eye candy. No surprises here, just the same old old. It's really one of the worst films ever made. Director Roger Korman should be suspended from a light base so children can use it as a sofa.
