This film is a joke and Quentin must be ashamed of himself, and tries to come out of this movie as the Modesty Belize sponsor. If you have a problem sleeping, all you have to do is rent this movie. The number of sticks that they call an actress supposedly supposed to be Modesty Belize should be the most boring person on the planet. Maybe it can be used as a platform for the backlighting caps for a real movie. Seventy-five minutes of nothing, thank you who invented the rapid submission button. If you see this movie if you can name it on your way to RUN. I can only think of what the third world country could use the money that was wasted from this nonsense. The film is boring, the actors are full of color, the air they breathe. If you want to watch Mostey Blaise, then watch the film they produced in the 1960s, maybe the director should do it.
