It was hard to watch this film and to be fair and objective because I am a big fan of the original 1944 movie. This for me and many others is one of the greatest films made by Noir. The realization of this film is just a short film made specifically for television and most people deleted it. I did not expect much, but you can only compare it with "44". After a scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at, and I remember how he played with Fred McMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Robinson and others. Now I see these famous actors playing their famous roles, replaced by Richard Kerena, Samantha Rijel and Lee Jie Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it ended, I did not find this as bad as I expected but it was not identical to the original 1944. The two main areas where this TV movie was not well (1) were the electricity between the two missing pieces and (2) only 90 minutes, rushed the story with the difficulty of time to develop the scheme, characters and chemistry between those threads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply did not match MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson", respectively. <br /> <br /> This restructuring retained itself in other characters, such as Barton Keys and Edward Norton. He had a wonderful cup like Keys and Robert Weber as Norton, president of the insurance company. It was also somewhat interesting to see a change in the time frame, so homes, cars, telephones, dictators, etc., were all in the early 1970s instead of the mid-1940s. Otherwise, the story story was very similar, just rushed. <br /> <br /> However, one view was enough and I will happily return to the original release of the rest of my views of this classic story and film.
