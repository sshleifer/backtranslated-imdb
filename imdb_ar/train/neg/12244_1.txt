This movie is awesome. CGI CGI is a very cheap gray point CGI. The alligator looks like a large gray smudge. The worst is that no effort has been made at all to make him walk or look like a neighborhood. Most of them are CGIs that are captured for images and are placed in the viewer and almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI staining across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of the CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of Sci-Fi movies too bad. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the extreme lack of special effects, the cast consists of typical low-cost actors who are likely to work as waitresses / waitresses in local restaurants while waiting for large breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this film is when one of the bad guys tries to sexually assault Kate and jumps giant crocodiles from the water directly to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and across the porch and pulls the bad guy from Kate and instead of collapsing directly across the building (and crushing Kate), the Croc fly Back in the same corner in the water. The laws of physics can not be applied to this film or special effects. At least there is an honor among crocodiles.
