I saw this film at the AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I did not enjoy it. Starring Lucas Haas (Break, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kiss, The Five Sins, Hollywood Land) and Adam Scott (First Snow, School of Secret Arts). The director is Matt Bisonette, married to Molly Parker. The three actors do a good job in this film about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and the betrayal of the third husband. Everything happens at the lake house and it looks great. The film wants to treat his subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I think it was necessary to have it in the opposite direction.
