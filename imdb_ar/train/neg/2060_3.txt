A repressed housewife (an annoying nuisance Angie Dickinson, treated by our body / horrified with a close proximity to her appetite) feels sexually bored by her husband and decides to get away. This leads directly to a series of murders that will soon involve a first-rate prostitute (Nancy Allen, obviously in a wrong job if SHE can bring up $ 600 a night) and her psychologist Michael Kane. If you see De Palma rushing (excuse me, "Hitchcock," see "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", an elegant and artistic one, is one of the most thrilling films I've ever felt comfortable sitting around. The plot is silly and tiring. It is characterized by some sudden jump concerns and bad graphic killing sequences that must satisfy any fan of horror, as long as they can transcend the ridiculous story line, which must be dated until 1980.
