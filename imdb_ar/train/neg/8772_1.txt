There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying repeatedly on the same hill. The cast was excellent, but unfortunately, the producer / director / editor / God was wrong. He had to have eaten a modest pie (if not for his own good and then for the men who died in Cargill), hired an illustrious Bollywood manager, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, and hired a musician who somehow had nothing to do with him Seemed to have listened to a bad version of "End of the World Now" on some cheap Indian drugs), hired a real professional crew, threw all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, like the eminent figures of the Indian army, he made decisions that were terrible for his representatives, and terrible to his audience. We have died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> Note: The next time the Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest appointing more than one Nepalese to represent the team. Certainly there are a lot of Nepali men working in Bombay - the last number was 40 to half a million.
