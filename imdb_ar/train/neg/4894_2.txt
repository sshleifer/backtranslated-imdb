Needless shots, permanent shots, useless scenes are what you'll find in this movie. In other words, I looked technically bad. The musical bits are routed amateurishly (there is no synchronization in the possible dance, bad improvisation after, bad and clear improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.) <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. In the end, it makes a few points and even less logical. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some comics are already effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse, so that it is not entirely tolerable and can not be understood by the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer you saw was very dynamic, and that's not true for the film. This means that the contrast between the trailer and the actual film is very close to rupture.
