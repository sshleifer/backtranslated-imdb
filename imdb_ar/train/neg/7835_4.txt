Man, I really wanted to love these shows. I am starving for some good TV and I salute TNT to provide these "opportunities". But unfortunately, I'm in the minority I guessed when it comes to Stephen King. Although King's book is wonderful, the irony is that it simply does not translate well into the screen, big or small. With very few exceptions, King's experience can not be likened to the same effect as stories when reading them. Many people do not agree with this, but I am sure that in their hearts they must recognize that the best picture of the king is just a pale memory of the story they read. The reason is simple. The story of the middle king revolves around the mental image of the characters in the story. It gives us a glimpse of their inner thoughts, emotions and sometimes or unrealistic views. In short, King takes the reader places where you can not put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed king, we have less than half the information the reader can access. It is not impossible to claim that one becomes a character in the story of the king they read, while one is limited to a small glimmer of the same character when filmed. King has always written, Hollywood will try to capture everything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of whether or not they should. I do not blame filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent to be able to adapt Stephen King beyond reach. The task is to turn lead into gold, or to master a mysterious zen. Well, better luck next time.
