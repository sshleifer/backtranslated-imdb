Philip. Movie: Dickian. A decent one for that matter. Better Than Salary (Woo) This abomination is called the Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the end of torsion and cheese was too much for me. In the middle of the film, I am already afraid of this kind of endings, I was unfortunately right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth his time. No, not at all. The first half (as many have already commented here) is wonderful. There are some parts that begin to doubt whether the director intends to deliver a message that the art of appearing is very important in the future (we will do this kind of thing on fun things because we can) or it simply has been combined. But paranoia is there and feeling "out of joint" too. this is good.
