What makes the French contact works very well is the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Rousseau (Cheddar). In this disaster brought out by Frankenheimer (who also brought us jewels like Raineer Games and Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession with capturing Charnier (Rey). The delusional notion that the New York Police Department will allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Scharnier with the help of French local authorities is laughing out loud. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Scharnier did not hit the city with 65 lbs from the hard hit !!! The street value of 32 million but yes, let's send Doyle to find this man, he was pinch him after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (except for Wahid Hackman, who exaggerated too much of his part). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were awful. Do yourself a favor and see the first installment twice and skip this installment.
