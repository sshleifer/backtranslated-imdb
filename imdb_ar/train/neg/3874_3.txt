This film was highly anticipated, hoping all the time that the obvious suspect was innocent, and there is still another major development. However ... no. He is still behaving in a frightening way, and continues to ignore him. Mary found very incriminating evidence in place, and she still trust him? And what was "trap fishing"? There was no trap. I ran into him and said, "Excuse me, I have to go to kill someone." He left, and that was the end. They are trying to use other suspects (such as the older Carnival girl in the end) but they are completely backward. In fact, all characters lag behind. They do not have depth, just strange setting ... Who is camping in a recycling plant? Checkered and nothing was developed well. For example: When you leave his place after eating beer, he finds the pics as he runs out and he grabs them and ends up having sex in that car ... What is this? Her reactions were not photographed. I acted in the car as scared as it could have been practically raped, but all we see is bathing the next morning. booooooooo it could have been much better .. sooo much better.
