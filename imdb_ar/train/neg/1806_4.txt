Antonioni films have aged not well. What has always amazed me is that, along with the unquestioning plastic beauty, there is a dull and educational "psychology" of characters and attitudes. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and "evil capitalism" that you want to sing to him in "La notte", or Monica Vitti laugh at the peasants who are juggling the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti drops the ink cup at the end of the same movie . <br /> <br /> Yesterday I reviewed Zabriskie Point. In this film there are many nice and detailed shots of Rod Taylor's office, the streets and highways of Los Angeles, advertising ads, deserts, etc., which show the author's charm on his American journey, at the same time the road from Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are a lot of leftist cliches that spoil the film: - The boy leaves the meeting and steals an airplane and flies over the desert in order to free himself and find "something different". - The executives in the gray wings talk all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the "faces of women" in the swimming pool and leaves her because she does not want to be like them. - A fat middle-class couple in the caravan, in front of the beauty of nature, speaks of building a hotel and making a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples make love in the desert. What a hippie nonsense! Sorry, today, after half a century of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except "Le amiche" and perhaps "Il grido") are just a bunch of aesthetics and common places.
