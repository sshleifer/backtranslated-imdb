Un-bleeping-ratifying! Meg Ryan does not even look like her usual pert beloved in this, which makes me usually forgive her Shitek acting shallow. Hard to believe they were the product in this dog. In addition to Kevin Klein: What kind of suicide trip did his career have? Wosh ... Benzai !!! This was finally directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a repeat of Johnstown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
