This scares the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find her more enjoyable than the scary, but with some very disturbing moments and kind of corrupt quality that I love. To consider, the plot is actually disgusting ... but it has been treated with some taste. If there is a problem with this film, there are huge loopholes where nothing exciting or exciting happens. Also, the end lasts forever, making her climax tense and potentially absurd after a while with Scream and Barbara Bach. "Monster", after being exposed, is not very scary unfortunately. The somewhat harsh appearance of the film also works against it, making it appear more like a television movie than something prepared for theaters. But this is an example of films that are rarely produced these days, so I urge horror lovers to watch them and feel a little nostalgic ...
