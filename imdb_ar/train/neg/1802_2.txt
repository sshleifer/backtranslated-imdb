A bad movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, oh ... this is one of the movies that does not have a single positive effect. Only everything from the actors to the story stinks into the sky. I'm just wondering how low I.Q. You should see and enjoy this type of click. <br /> <br /> Is anything worth watching? Well, there's a lot of nudity involved, but that's not something special. And when you think only that it can not get worse, you realize that all the naked ladies looked like they were forty. Come on guys, where did you look for these actresses? In the old house, perhaps. <br /> <br /> In any event, the leading actresses have sex appeal and know how to show it. Again, very bad, it is very skinny and older. All in all, skip this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
