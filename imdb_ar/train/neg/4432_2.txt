The story of Tatie Danielle revolves around an old pilgrim who tortures her loving and oblivious family. There is little subtext that may be about France's colonial past, but it is often only Daniel who does things (such as deliberately abandoning a child in a garden), which will put a man picking his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. Looks good and behaves well and there is no error in this concept but just SMUG. God, does this movie love itself. Unfortunately it is not as smart or funny as you think it is. The only motivation in the program - sorry, the movie - comes from Daniel getting more and more evil, and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does it. This is true: just as it happens in a sitcom, which happens, with the addition of a "reward" for grandeur fantasies and a running time of 110 minutes.
