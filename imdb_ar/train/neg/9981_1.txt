This movie was described as a comedy and a puzzle. It failed badly both. The only puzzle here is why anyone makes such a bad movie. The only comedy is the laugh I got when I saw how high readers are here. Can there be two movies with the same name? The film I saw portrayed a girl with a beautiful blue eyes and a plot that did not exist. <br /> <br />
