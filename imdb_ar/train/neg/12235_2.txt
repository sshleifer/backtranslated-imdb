If you want to know the kind of music that white people listened to in 1974, this is the right movie for you. But you have to listen to a lot of psalms and violins, too (see my notes on My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> A lenient confession: I have dealt with My Girl 2 with irony and annoyance, having just seen her predecessor. But as someone willing to finally look for my mother, My Girl 2 made me look like a mother. <br /> <br /> In other words, anything I liked about My Girl 2 was nothing at all about My Girl 2, but as for the hero who asks, like many adoptors, "Who is Mama?" If there are home movies for my mom in the acting band, I'll be sure to make my own film about it. <br /> <br /> People without conscience. The films should not be unscrupulous. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... useless. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are fully depleted and feel comfortable through a series of small discomforts.
