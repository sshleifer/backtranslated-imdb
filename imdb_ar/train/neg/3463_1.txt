I watched this movie the other night, and I must say frankly that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Representation is fair, but the plot is absolutely absurd. A killer was born because of all the "energy used to make a movie" and if the killer film was shot he would die? How incredible that? The characters were at least underdeveloped ... For example, the man suddenly said, "Do not you try to complete the film because your mother can not?" So we're supposed to agree to this? We had no idea that she was her daughter until the middle of the film. The film did not highlight anyone, we knew nothing about the main characters who survived except the character Ringwald was a fairy actress, the man was on stage when people died and wanted Ravi to be a director like her mother. Do not really dive into knowing who they are. Things seemed just to kill. The whole plot is very weak for my tastes and I was very disappointed. It is clear that anyone who has enjoyed this exotic piece needs to learn a thing or two about filmmaking. I can not believe anyone agrees to a star or even work on this picture. Not funny, it was not scary and was vulgar through the entire film. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which you thought was not difficult at all to do. It is a disgrace and I am deeply sorry that I wasted an hour and a half watching chaos. 10/01.
