I rented this movie the other night because it was not seen by my girlfriend or myself before, although we heard from a common friend how wonderful it was. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm very conservative in my life views, but I knew that would be very liberal given who he was directing. I figured before the film began, Michael Douglas played a popular liberal affectionately loved by the masses, and there would be a conservative conservative opponent like his opponent. But I thought that this is where the political statement will begin and end. <br /> <br /> Well, the plot was solid: the one president falls on the pressure group. Well, this has potential I thought was very entertaining, where the plot was unique. But then the film turned into a commercial liberalism. The film has become more about arms control and environmental issues than it is about the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Penning). <br /> <br /> There were many silly buildings in this movie: 1) Sydney Personality Play this six figure lobby which is "nearer". Can you be more frivolous? She was constantly unorganized and looked in awe of everything. Barely "closer". I sales, she can not "close" the sale of a glass of water to a man dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more ironic than Richard Dreyfus playing right-wing fanaticism? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and played by some right wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked the way he took his conservative character and made him as evil as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech was ultimately ironic. The line around "I am a proud cardholder of the American Civil Liberties Union" was a joke. First, no president will recognize such a thing, being an active member of an extremist group. Second, why even raise something like that. I have just isolated more than half of the moderate or conservative film audience. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was wonderful and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film turned from being a "film" to a left-wing political statement, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It is shameful to see a big conspiracy destroyed by Hollywood to force its political views on the public
