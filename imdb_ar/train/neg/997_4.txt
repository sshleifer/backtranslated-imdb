After remodeling "Lipstick" recently for the first time in a few decades, I supported it by "Descent" even though I heard negative comments more than good from other film friends with varied tastes like my comments. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare how a unique place in Rape Revenge has evolved in the past 32 years, from the complete collection "I Spit On Your Grave" to the miserable thrill of "Lipstick" Good handling of the case in the "accused". But "getting off", although raising some important points, does not really give us anything really new in terms of revelation. No, the "descending" is very badly done in terms of image and sound quality, detracting from any important message that he might hope to direct - a message, when closely examined, not in the foreground. <br /> The plot is well known. What I wanted to see was the descent or deterioration of Dawson's character. Being a fan of Prozario, I was keen to see the layers being stripped away and slowly being ... as you know, the kind of photography that DeNiro brings to the "taxi driver". Unfortunately, text and director / writer options do not provide any kind of reasonable transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is Chapter Two. It became clear what the director's intentions were for this category of mobility between clubs, drug abuse and obsession with the great black stallion Adrian (the nightmare of every white and fun boy) of Q & A on DVD, but this trip to Dawson's character was never completely believable. We do not know exactly what the hell is doing half the time, or what to do, or why do it. Poor audio / video quality does not help again, but the sequence is too long and meaningless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the leading character created during the well-executed first season. By the time we reached the end, our attention had already diminished. <br /> <br /> One of the points of success Dawson pointed out in Q & A is that by the end of the scene "revenge", we are being pumped for revenge, and then realized the reality of the tragic and ugly reality. Although this is certainly true, it does not make the scene more interesting. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, see the deleted Classroom scene. It's an excellent 8-minute experience that excels energy and provocation (although it's all verbal) and really shows Dawson's slow cracking effect and is pleasantly enlivened by Francis Swift's chilling sleep counselor. If more illustrations are added like this and the third part of the center is reduced, we may have an interesting psychological study on the impact of senseless violence. <br /> <br /> While the film finally stands still, all we've got is what we've seen before, just in a more graphic view. So what?
