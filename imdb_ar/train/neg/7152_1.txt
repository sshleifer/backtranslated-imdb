Based on a novel that serves itself as her boyfriend and her one-time group. Scott Fitzgerald, columnist and gossip writer Sheila Graham wrote this painful story. Gregory Beck continues in a shameless excess as a drunk or cursed drunk addict. In contrast to Scott Fitzgerald's real gentle-spoken real. Focusing on the age of writing at Fitzgerald in Hollywood, in his late life, the much famous author, in fact, lived a quiet life and resisted his addiction effectively at a time when AA was not yet known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to recycle his stories to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Life in a small apartment and driving a used Chevrolet was 180 degrees different from that filmed in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost every twentieth-century film produced during the filming of Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as almost every film directed by Henry King, was an excellent work. The infidel was the exception.
