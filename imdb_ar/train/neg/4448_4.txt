She was greeted by a strong start to the film when Julia Roberts' character was marked by her abusive husband and the anguish played by Patrick Bergen and I felt ready to try a strong film on the same level as the film The Burning Bed. Well, the summary says I was wrong. It was not like The Burning Bed, which had the power of fur to play the role of the woman I really felt, and felt the pain and need to stay. Drifting sleep with the enemy after the first act to cheap excitement with Roberts forging her death to escape her husband and go to live in Iowa. At first, her husband thought she had died but he began to doubt that she might still be alive and then set off. The rest of the film is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity .... There is no mention of course how I got the money for this but at this stage of the film I did not care much about it. She meets a man (Mr. Nice is a coward) and falls for him and her husband in the end, but not before he rearranges the soup boxes and prepares the kitchen. This was supposed to offer a cheap bargain to the public. But I did not care much if the wife was abused because the film as I said has fooled the public. If he had stayed of course I might have felt her and her situation. Of course, the husband is killed and everything is fine for the little lady Roberts. If the real world is anything close to this .... Watch The Burning Bed and you'll understand what the film is supposed to be about the subject of domestic abuse.
