I watched the movie tonight in a free preview show, and although I did not pay a dime to see this movie, I still feel uncomfortable. Ladies and Gentlemen, Time is money, and if you see this movie, you leave Benjamin on your seat. Representation is distressing at best. Kiefer Sutherland's phone is in the worst case of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to realize that he has chosen a bad choice, leaving Catherine Zeta Jones for the duration of the shooting. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; she seems to read her lines from the remote control. If you can not discover the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, it has just landed on the planet of a world without TV and story lines recycled. If you really want to see a very secret film about the service, rent it in the line of fire. If you see and buy this one, you'll start to fear for the safety of the president because the secret service looks and acts like adult versions of the 90210 types. Regardless of your feelings about W, let's hope this "art" does not imitate life.
