I like a lot of actors / actresses involved in this project, so the feeling of insult from the film felt worse than if they were using an unknown. The main problem is that this film was just a concept created to attract newborns. In 20 or 30 years, Nbc is likely to make such a film in the early 1990s. I can see it now in a black family where the children participate in la riot, while the white family includes the rebel children and they listen to the rock music. The soundtrack will include bands such as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden and others. Such a cheese would be just like the sixties and I assure you that NBC will do it. You see that the biggest problem with cutting off the period when you are finished buying networks is that when you live in a certain period of time do not think that I live in the sixties or any decade is the modern reaction at the time. The next time someone does something like this you should put more weight into the project there
