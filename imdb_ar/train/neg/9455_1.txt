Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We have been bombarded with ads from Cat In The Hat so much that we think there should be something good about this film. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give them a chance. Well, I had to go with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Again prove that the average person can be programmed to believe that anything he says is good, it must be good. Apart from the humiliating truth that the film takes only 80 minutes, it is clear that it started with an ethereal line eaten. It's full of failed attempts at senseless humor and dreadful Bastille scenes. It jumps all over the universe without a destination or direction. Then this worsens with, ............................ Yes, I will say, bad acting! I could only feel that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was it intended to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Praslin and Dakota Fanning were not a prize, but Mr. Myers had to disappear under a rock somewhere to be ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
