The plot is clear An old man lives on the main road in the woods One day a man kills a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the attempts of the old man to try to convince the police that what he saw was not the fabric of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man directs police to the scene of the crime and no body can be found. Soft For Digging contains a trivial dialogue that reflects most of the movie's scenes, an old man living alone in a house. During the film, I found I was scared twice, that is when the child suddenly fell in front of the old man. The rest of the film I must admit did not share; I found the pace of the film a bit slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took a long time. I feel there could have been a relationship between me and the child and the old man. Alone in the forest at night, the uncertainty that your mind may lead to some strange situations, children are always scared like ghosts, see dark water.
