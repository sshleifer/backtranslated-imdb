During the first three seasons, parents were as exotic as delicious like hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it is delicious like Pepto-Bismol. Unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after watching the most recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence, leading to no laughter. Cosmo, once one of Nick's favorite characters, has turned into a non-aggressive Cretan, so offensive that Family Guy will not want to know him. Timmy jerkwad became a smug egoist that Bart Simpson would happily win out (due to Timmy's inattention, this would take a lot of beatings). The poor Wanda ... a real magician has become a victim of her husband and her fans, and is now described as "grumbling" to care for the welfare of others. The stupidity of Cosmo causes pain to anyone else, but he has not been punished for it, nor learns any lessons. Which largely sums up Butch Hartmann's attitude toward the children: They are rude, stocky and not very bright. Praise be to God. This has been canceled by Ton Al-Mormash, along with my beloved Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. At least the Butch got what it deserved - unlike Cosmo.
