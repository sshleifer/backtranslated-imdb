This film, supposedly supposed to stir, had about five sub-pieces that simultaneously evolved to its ultimate climax, but ended up yawning. <br /> <br /> The writing was vulgar, the pace was slow and unbroken and the characters were boring. George Clooney seems to need access to the gym, and Matt Damon installed it, and others seemed to read their lines from the remote control. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is that it was carefully designed to be politically correct, so it ended up saying nothing at all about big companies, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries provide more excitement. Just watch it if there is anything else at all to do.
