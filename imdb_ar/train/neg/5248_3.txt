We strongly recommend that Die Sieger be one of the few good action films produced in Germany. I saw it last night and I must admit I am very disappointed. If it is supposed to be "the last hope for a better" entertainment and challenge in German motion cinema, there will not be much left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" is trying to be exciting, bold and angry, but not that. Wooden characters and stereotypes and whenever they do something unexpected (this does not happen too much), do it against their nature. This makes it difficult - for me almost impossible - follow it or even recognize it. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the movie is very bad. There is not one person I believe in. Probably the highest administrator in the SWAT unit - but that's it. These people who try to look or act like special units, like elite police - do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not too bad after all. But I think it was said badly. Do not recognize a bad guy at all - for example. When after a "very dark" show Carl Simon (the good man) asks his dead opponent already "Why? ... Why?" I have asked myself the same question, knowing that Dominique Graf will not have the answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I think Germany can do better, even with motion movies.
