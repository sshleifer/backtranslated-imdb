What can you say about a 16mm thick marble film, where the best and most attractive performance is the German Shepherd? Nothing would be positive. Avoid this farce at all costs. In any case, it will be difficult to find, as hegemony remains a taboo subject in the United States. I strongly suggest the IMDb re-visit its weighting formula to create ratings, since the 8.8 rating for this piece of feces is ridiculous! I am, by no means, proud and spent long hours enjoying classic porn movies in the 1970s and 1980s; but this is the least expensive product even by the more flexible standards of the elk ring (and then illegal).
