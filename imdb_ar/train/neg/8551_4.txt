It is 1982, two years after the siege of the Iranian embassy in which the dramatic rescue of SAS from the balconies took place, and with the war with Argentina on the Falkland Islands that is under way, what is the best film to be produced from Gung-Ho "SAS" The siege of the Iranian hostage, while using the hero of the movement number one British today, Louis Collins. Throw in Edward Woodward and a few well-known actors you've won over your hands? Well maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the representation is completely second-rate. The movie is like a long episode of "professionals", but without the formula. This film does not go fast and completely predictable. Maybe you saw Cubby Brocoli this movie and decided to give up Louis Collins as an alternative to the James Bond Award for Roger Moore. Watch it if you have a fan of Louis Collins or SAS things in general, if not, save your time.
