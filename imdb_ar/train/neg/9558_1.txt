I thought this was a complement to some species and was originally supposed to be from 1983. But the sequel does not take the original plot and destroy it. <br /> <br /> I actually had a little expectation for this film, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No suspense - I actually feel clairvoyant, misbehaving, and full of technical errors, so I'm like a computer geek I could not believe it. They tried to make it a mix between a general war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worth a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie, it's a waste of time. Rather than getting the original. Attribute is still valid. Do not let too much energy in the device. The representation and the plot are more exciting and attractive.
