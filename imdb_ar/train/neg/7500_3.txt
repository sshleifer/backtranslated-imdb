Spike lee must be one of the most evaluative directors I have ever seen. He is my critic darling because he is supposed to make films with a "message" or he is bohemian in his approach, making critics who are flooded with Hollywood films eat his objects simply because they are different. <br /> <br /> Summer Sam does not even do it well. Cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, as well as narrative. The plot is very similar to "do the right thing". The filming of "Guidos" or the computer that appointed the Italian Americans (which happened to be one of them) directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Eddie Murphy's impression of a muscular Italian man fighting a much older African-American is more believable than the wide-ranging Italian cartoons shown here (John Leguzimo's character is a possible exception). <br /> <br /> Is anyone who has seen this movie been able to figure out how it will end? As soon as Ritchie appeared in the film, I could see the fist in his face and foot in his stomach, and I was already seeing him as a murderer. This character has the most integrity in the entire film, of course, will show me what happens to people who stand out in a crowd (who has a twisted white band!) <br /> <br /> Please, please give Spike Lee a permit Lifetime for all the basketball games he wants. So, he may enjoy himself too much to take a movie camera for a long time and we will not have to subject him to his leadership of self-importance. Moreover, I will not have to see the critics (some of whom I respect) and hate him to the emperor without clothes.
