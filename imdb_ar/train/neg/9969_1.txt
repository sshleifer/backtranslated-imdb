I joined this site to see the comments people will make about this absolute disaster for a movie. I did not need a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw every subject they could think of in the hope of sticking to something. I bet (and hope) that everyone involved in the teachers will be embarrassed. There are some great actors here but you will never know that. Thank God she did not ruin the lives of Morgan Freeman, Gad Hirsch, Nick Nolty or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no love here, no terrible effort. BTW I do not think the writer put his foot in a real school.
