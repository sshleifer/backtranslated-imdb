This semi-Italian horror film begins largely as a very soft porn film and turns into a mystery that has many loose ends, and this fairly boring fact makes this film away from tastes. The only thing worth watching really is the many breasts spread throughout the film. The story contains a man who at the beginning of the film drew the girls to his castle where he begins to take them to his cell and go berserk and apparently kill them. They show nakedness, but they never show murder at this stage of the film. Then the man finds a nice red head at a party and continues to get out and marry her. He has something for the red heads that she sees as his ex-wife Eveline loved one, and also died under conditions that should not be from the audience. After a lot of wonderful scenes, the killings involving snakes, foxes and the like begin. At this point, it is easy enough to know who is responsible for the murders and what is the motive. Then you have an illogical end where everything ends badly. This film did not work for me, he left me a lot of questions and the last third of the film did not have the first two thirds of the film. The explanation of Evelyn's death would have helped the film as it would have a kind of ending where Evelyn got up from the grave. Granted the title is not entirely misleading because it did kind of leave the grave, not just under its own authority. The top of the light is very light in most because there is a scene with foxes and a scene in the end a little bit of blood also. I have often thought that this film was dull.
