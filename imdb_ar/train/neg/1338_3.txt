I saw the switch of the goals ... twice .... and the same feeling was always the same ... you see Olsen twins making the same movie .... They love playing different sports and then fall in love with the boys ... well now about the film .... First, not all boys and girls play such big goals ... 2. Do not play football at certain times ... 3. If the game is at its end, the referee gives some extra time (minutes or more) ... Expected to finish it .... I think this film is bad because of the lack of knowledge of football .... If it was produced by the European producers will be better .. And also that the German representatives are not Khaya Right ... They suffer from a lack of authentic .. Well, I've played some seasons in the full house, but this does not make them stars, old .... you have to show your talent. ... This is what is missing in Olsen twins
