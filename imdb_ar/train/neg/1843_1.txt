Wonderful. Simply awful. I was a fan of the original film, and sat sadly through Part 2, 3 was the improvement. 4,5 The dead Freddie was very bad. But nothing bad like Freddy's nightmares. Freddy acts as Rod Serlingesq's host of this collection. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became one after the other, but at least in films, Freddy carried the attraction of movies, but here they were badly made, looked like high school productions of a horror series. Poor actors, if you want to call yourself a name, it is obvious that after doing this offer was exactly what you paid for. I'm pretty sure that this was a break point for two representatives. Those just started on the Hollywood ladder, brand new ready to take part in any part that would delay having to take up that pornographic function that was offered to them last week, or the actors tested on their way to the Hollywood ladder ready to take any part that would put They have stopped having to take up the pornographic job they offered last week. <br /> <br /> Half of Dana Plato expected to be a guest star, but she was already dead by the time this production was made. <br /> <br /> To rewrite the Nancy line in the original Elm St, "If you never did, try not to fall asleep watching this."
