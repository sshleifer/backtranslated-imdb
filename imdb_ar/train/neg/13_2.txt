A weak plot, predictable violence, and only semi-interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) He imagined his own spiral corrections and adds enormous imaginations of drugs and murder to make them "hot." From rap music to predictable soundtracks, even family conflicts, they are poorly behaved, stereotypical, and finally boring in a terrible way. So the title has been by - IMDb lists five movies with the same name that was released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw it on Showtime, which included a summary of another film. It was half way before I realized that no one was a secret policeman. Even if there was another stereotype, I made it interesting if it happened.
