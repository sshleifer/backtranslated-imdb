Others have pointed out that this film is a collection of buzzing adventures for the unemployed or masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know after seeing the house of waste and acid that Scotland is one of the most depressed places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid home without a good dose of humor or brave real movies like this does not work. More importantly, without a decent text, the film will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought-provoking about the script for this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film won a number of the film BAFTA shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Australian film industry was very bad right now, but unfortunately, the British industry was even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I did not bother renting it from the weekly newspaper section. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a chance to give this movie a wide platform.
