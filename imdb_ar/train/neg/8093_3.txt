Based on Tom Sullivan's sarcastic novel (which I have not read yet), Tom Hanks plays his stars on the streets accidentally killing a black boy while he is in a bad part of New York City stars. Willis as a reporter begins Hanks in a downward spiral. It seems that there is no sympathy for anyone in this film and for comedy or satire, there is a lot of laugh too .. Melanie Griffith did her breasts during the filming so it was fun to do is to see if her breast size changed during Different parts of the film .. This will distract your mind from other things such as not D .. text or jokes on a scale of one to ten.
