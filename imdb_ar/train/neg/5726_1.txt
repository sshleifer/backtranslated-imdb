A Clear Class B Effort To take advantage of the Hostel / Saw pulses, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) Yet it was a disappointment on every level. The acting is very bad, it's not funny, the plot line is not there and the only intimidation was realizing I had lost one hour and 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people got a 10 star rating. I can only doubt that 33 of these are the cast and crew. The 34 are perhaps the mother directors? - Although I'm sure they'll find it difficult to rise higher than 2! DVD extras include a "make" feature for an hour. This raises the question "why?" (Although it may be useful to show what should not be done!). Avoid at all costs.
