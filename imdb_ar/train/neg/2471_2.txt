I remember again when I was young when I was away in the camp and we were sleeping under the stars. There was always someone who had a good story to tell him that it involved the forest that surrounded us and they always crawled me. Well, when Wendigo found the library, I checked it out hoping to be one of those movies that had a supernatural stalking people in the jungle like the stories that I narrated in the camp. Well, I felt a lot of resentment, and I was far from the truth. Wendigo really bad. The story begins when a three-member family leads into the winter cabin, which resembles your home in the ordinary suburbs and does not resemble the cabin in the forest, and collides with deer. Well, it seems that the local retarded people were chasing these particular deer and they are very upset with the people of our city. The film takes a long time to follow the daily activities of families rather than reaching the point of the film. It was not until about the last 15 minutes that we already had some actions involving "wendigo". My suggestion is to stay very far from this movie. I will leave you want your watch and half back.
