You want to watch "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not the film. This film is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good comments here seem to be written by fake third parties (poorly blocked). The people who made this film seem to be trying to gather fake attention. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good joke. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are an insult. <br /> <br /> The film is so lively that I can not imagine that anyone familiar with the subject finds it funny. The ability to laugh at yourself is of an important quality, but if you are the person who is insulted in this way, you should hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of a large spate of banned topics but because of its ongoing pathetic amazement.
