As the front cover says "Hamlet is our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this version of Hamlet directly after watching Kenneth Branagh's copy and it was a truly disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to many aspects of the play including sexual activity; one very very gay Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that in the sixties of the last century, this was a good version of Hamlet, but can not be compared with the full Branagh version. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the video in the local video store (in Australia) and looked for DVD Keneth Branagh to buy it if there was such a thing. If anyone knows one please tell me.
