I have written at least half a dozen sarcastic comments on this tiny little piece and none of them have been published, so I have to assume that someone at imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a handful of oil men could revive a military tank they had set up in the desert for more than a decade and make a fighting machine again is ridiculous. So it is representation and direction. Pass it.
