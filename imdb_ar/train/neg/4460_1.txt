Awesome! Avoid like plague. I would rate this at the worst 10 movies ever. Special effects, representation, mood, sound, etc. It seems to be done by daycare students ... Wait, I've seen better programs than this. It opens like a soft pornographic show with a naked naked female doing a shower scene and then getting worse from there. Naked scenes are good, but that is it. Sound and light problems were constant throughout the film. Sometimes I swore that I could hear the roar of camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see another film about this story, but it was done by different people. This group of actors and crew needs more acting and filmmaking lessons. Voice 1 out of 10.
