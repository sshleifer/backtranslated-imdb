It appears that this is a French film, LOL, focusing on young girls with much older men ... Why is the French emphasis on this kind of thing? When this age difference is great, it really explodes! Valentina Serve is pretty (she has a strong resemblance to Olivia Hossi, from Romeo and Juliet '68 in Zeffrelli '68 in a similar period), but looks forward to about 15 years and the actress who plays Tassi, her graphic trainer, looks ... well, 50 is KIND. <br /> <br /> Other posters have explained the historical record (unusually detailed) of the real Artemisia, a remarkable artist and one of the first recognized painters of this period (17th century). She tells us her story in modern times, especially because of the old accusation that "all great artists were men" - they largely enforce bits - and that the story of her rape experience is impressive. She was not only plainly assaulted and forced to have an abusive sexual relationship (because in those days marrying your aggressor was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassie was armed and possibly killed his wife and child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is being horribly damaged by the heart of this wonderful and wonderful real life story - very exciting and does not need any "seasoning" - because in a hotter way, it is "hotter" A hot love relationship with a man old enough to be her grandfather. This "sexy" - the truth is boring and seems to be very feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> It also bothers me that this is only part of the life of Artemisia, which is considered interesting enough to portray. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous paintings of Judith with the beheading of Holfern was drawn after, not before the rape), and she was the first woman recognized in the prestigious Florentine Academy, which went on to have children ... boring things. After all, it is a middle-aged woman and not "hot" like teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are a lot of creative licenses in the film industry (or book) about a real historical character film. You need to create a dialog box, have subdivisions, create a dramatic structure. Surely some details can be sacrificed - it is not important if the dates were moved a few years, or if Artemisia was played by a blonde actress (when we know from her own self that she was a brunette ... and one big reward, not a slim mini), or something from Such. But turning her story into her, and making rape into a love story, is actually a disease and a worry. It's worse because the director is female. You must feel very ashamed of herself! <br /> <br /> If you like this (and I know that some people may be more interested in real artists such as period fashion and hot sex), you might like "Dangerous Beauty" with Rufus Sewell and Kathryn McCormack on a similar basis to the strongly rewritten history , With lots of flowering flowers and jeweled cups: Bon Appetit!
