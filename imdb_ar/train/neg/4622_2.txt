No wonder this film never saw the light. The timing of the release was appalling. "Gong Show" already showed "shark shark" by the time the film appeared, so who would pay only to see some of the censored footage from the original show? The show clips are just a small part of this 90-minute pathetic twilight by Chuck Barris about how difficult his life as a show host is. Do you really expect that we feel sorry for him and for his corrupt millionaire life? Do you really think we wanted to know about his life? (It is clear that, since he later wrote his biographical biography of his career as a CIA agent.) Did he think of a person, would the test be anywhere new for 90 minutes? Or the network administrator who chases him at every turn? This may be a blueprint for a episode of a sitcom for 30 minutes, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was good to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and The Comic Comic again (although to make the film "warm", it included only the most vulgar). As someone else has pointed out, this is the first part of Phil Hartman's films (although it lasts only one minute). Note that his name is written HARTMANN in credits, the name of which he was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expressions, although he is thinner and much smaller in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Tall Blues Street) also has a small part. One of his first after leaving the world soap.
