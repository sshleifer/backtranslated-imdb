This movie contains a few things that happen immediately. Danny Fleth's presence as a major actor automatically leads some people to make such a film. Admittedly, Cradle of Filth loved the soundtrack of this film well before he saw it. Danny Philth is a highly recognized personality and leads to great progress. The independent imaging of the film is great for the creeping factor. There are some actresses GORGEOUS in this film. Being low budget, the special effects were not too bad. The ways in which people died were very creative and obsessive. <br /> <br /> Now the negatives. There is very little talk during this entire film, which makes very little personal development. It is difficult to fear for the lives of sterile characters fixed. When there was little talk, the F bomb was plentiful, appeared in random places. Yes, I understand that I swear to people, but there seems to be a little boy who wrote this and I think it's great because it includes all the languages. My story, what I could do of it, was good, although leaving too many parts hanging around and not having a conversation leaves one wondering what is going on. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like pornographic for people who love sex and violence, but like a pornographic trying to dispense with a story, it does not work very well. Hire it though, if you are a sick person looking to moisten your blood and meat appetites.
