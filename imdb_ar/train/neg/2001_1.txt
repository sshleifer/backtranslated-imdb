Why was there a lot of people crowding in the evening of Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" ("Contra Todos") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a successful man," Siddiqui said. "Well ... it's Brazilian." Beautiful multi-color people, tropical weather, lush tunes, hip gang plot? The temptations are undoubtedly adequate. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us simple details: this is a very bad film, very horrible, and it's not good to watch because it's bad-made. <br /> <br /> So how did Contra Todos tour Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, and many smaller local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently because of the way the promotional process works and the film festival circuit. <br /> <br /> First of all, she won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival where she was named Best Brazilian Film of the Year. It must be a bad year. They've had a lot, much better. Then, the snappy snippets in the catalogs as well as the fictional buzz lead to crowded halls - and since the film is not being shown anywhere and thus avoids careful scrutiny by critics - it continues to take tours. <br /> <br /> Festivals are aimed at insulting. In the promotion of Goose sometimes it is very much. One of Chicago's so-called "Contra Todos", "a ball cocktail that was soon launched directly outside Brazil" and referred to Claudia's friend as "the slum-like neighborhood." Soninha is "Teodoro's teenage daughter of a booming sexual activity." The film "was repeatedly filmed by the portable camera" and the director "works on a real sense of desperation caused by domestic despair and degradation." The impact is "unbearable and fair," and the film rushes "towards a dead end like the lives of the people shown." Not the best writing, but it certainly increases the excitement of a particular type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> Contra Todos means a successful man, two successful men, a wife and two daughters who once again gave birth to a Christian friend. It was filmed - in a very ugly digital video without the talent behind camera work - mostly in a poor suburb that looks barren instead of one of the crowded "slums" or poor town that looks like a village village where great movies like "Black Orpheus" and "Pixote And "City of God", not in Rio this time, but in Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> The successful man with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with the drug problem Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a small television experience as do the actress who plays Claudia's blonde wife Teodoro (Leona Cavalli) and Sylvia Lorenzo playing his daughter Sonny They may make these actors through the rear corners of some of the telenovelas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apart from them, there are some young people who come across Tyurdoro or, when busy, gangs of thugs. The directors do not work much, although the camera swells their pores. <br /> <br /> Two observers, one at the Berlin Film Festival and one in London, saw the failures of this film but unfortunately, buried in remote areas on the Internet. Henry Sheehan of Berlin noted that "the film" (his quotations) was "the worst video work" offered. "It seems that the director chose the video because it was simply a cheap alternative to the film, and he did not use any creative means for the new mediator," Sheehan wrote. "He did nothing else creatively. <br /> <br /> Sheehan pointed out the first big mistake of the film: "It starts as a local drama that is supposed to escalate when Moreira reveals after half an hour of work that the father and one of his friends have achieved professional success with men. Waiting for thirty minutes adds nothing to the film. ; It seems to be a completely arbitrary decision, at least a waste of time, but the escalation is all that Moreira does at all, like a little boy who has a tool kit on his birthday and walks around in the din of everything on the horizon without rhyme, reason or skill. Real. <br /> <br /> In an attempt at the 2004 London Festival for Kamera.com, the Sinnacak tried to look at the E side Gabi, but nevertheless lacked the features of the recall in the call "movie easily" best feature performances. " Yes, very easily, considering that everything else is very bad. "This low-cost, violent and innovative account of the outlaws in São Paulo is not without any likable characters, and as a result, it is dark and ironic to be a novel of the human condition, the film does not help you in poor translation," Senjac admitted. "Dogm" and Mike Lee did not help things. <br /> <br /> Apart from the senseless first half hour, in which nothing makes you feel bored from waiting for the first acts of violence - which, when they come, is just "hitting everything on the horizon without rhyme, reason or skill" - Moreira clumsily tries to recover his sudden seal by adding what seems to overtake him immediately, followed by an absurdly absurd final scene where the married characters are married. There is no doubt that the director wanted to show the "vanity of evil" to low-level men in working-class neighborhoods, but he can not make the characters he sees in general, alive to us. The structure of the film explains that he can not adjust his material either. <br /> <br /> (Watched at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005)
