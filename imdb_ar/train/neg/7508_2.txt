I hope Spike Lee has chosen a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" has the impression that the film revolves around the evil serial killer, David Berkowitz. it's not. It was a gruesome picture of the life of the streets of New York City during the hot summer of 77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film follows many young fictional characters in an American Italian neighborhood, and their reactions to the son of Sam threaten. There is Vinny and his wife Deona. There are Richie and Robbie, and many other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not likable. They are routinely annoying, and sometimes unbearable. Afterward, Lee expresses their high energy and chaotic life full of anger, lust and public unrest. There are at least two scenes of protracted battles between Vinnie and his wife, disco dance scenes redundant, countless celebrations ... I kept wondering: Where's the movie editor? <br /> <br /> At the same time, with all that much, the film gives the opportunity to express any real sense of fear or dread arising from the threat of Sam's son, which is much in the background. My more successful in showing a different kind of danger, arises from the neighborhood eligibility groups. <br /> <br /> The representation is uniformly good. This, along with 70 disco music, lavish attention to fashion and production design, makes you really feel that you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York City in 1977. <br /> <br /> However, the authenticity of the film in the atmosphere is hardly enough To make up for the exaggerated and exaggerated text about the lives of people who are very angry.
