This was the worldwide release of the cheap man of the NWA during the reign of Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s on the Big 3 stations translated during the Saturday madness / afternoon of manic wrestling. When Ted Turner got the failed NCAA Crockett, he turned it into a World Championship wrestling and kept dropping all NWA references. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were renamed WCW and moved from the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, and eventually became more than just offers for Witw's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last WCW program in the Turner program to broadcast the weekend for WCW purchase from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW Worldwide video archive and the entire NWA / WCW video library are placed in the basement of the WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
