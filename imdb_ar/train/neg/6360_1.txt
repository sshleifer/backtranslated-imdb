Can I get $ 13.00? I'd rather watch "Hydropower come to North America". one more time. This is a movie with one voice. The same sound, which comes out of all mouth characters regardless of age or gender. To listen to this sound again, I will have to charge at least $ 150 an hour. I do not take insurance. It was odd to watch Will Ferrell turn into Woody. But I do not think fantasy casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. Unless he does it just to get the money. If that's the case, why not just re-issue the All-Rap version of the "Tiger Lily?"
