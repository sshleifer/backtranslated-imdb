The collusion cycle is worse than the movie "Bad Male Male Capital" for the week. This film is less fun than toothache. Jay Leno can act. It's good in his first film, Sylvie Bears, in which he performs a performance that consists of his character requirements. This film is very bad character Lino, a holy clown, less disturbing than the character of Morita, a holy fool.
