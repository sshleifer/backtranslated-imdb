This version / ramoff Paramount of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE Get GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not all that unusual or innovative. There may be marketing comments and an introduction to saving what is really a very bad Western musical film on an audio show like a live TV show. I can not find Cyclorama's use of the background, lit up in different scenes in yellow, pink, or red, or .... all that creative. As noted, it seems to me more like a film produced on a TV budget: all sound clips, with small groups supported by lighted cybers! (Compared with the new faces of 1952.) The actors were reasonably well affected, and this approach was better achieved when Paramount filmed LI'L ABNER in 1959. For example, this film often suggests the often repeated question: "What was it? They think? "
