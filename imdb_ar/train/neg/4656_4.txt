A remarkable new edition of an old English film that was celebrated. Although they may be over-disastered as a complete disaster (which they are not), they do not build any tension and betray the origins of television. Richard Burton sleeps during his role, and Sophia Loren's closed face (in this film) shows little emotion. (**)
