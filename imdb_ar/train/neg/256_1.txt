What? Is Jimmy Fox supposed to be funny? Martin Lawrence, because he tries hard to imitate in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly and unevenly, and what comes out of him is some parts that are somewhat similar to Denzel's, yet the mechanic does not stand up, then suddenly goes to be Martin Lawrence, a funny comic and not silly. There's no personal touch to all that, I mean, he does not contribute anything to the character he's trying to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. It's really Mr. Dull-boy personally. <br /> <br /> I really hope in Hollywood, and the black community in America will find a better person to launch it into great stardom, like Don Cheadle for example, but perhaps a pathetic Jimmy is the generation that adjusts the old better.
