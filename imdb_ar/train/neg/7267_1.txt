This film is simply too long, and very frequent, with the nudity and sexual nature of males (as it is said to be gay with my own set of adult titles) unjustified and unnecessary. It was possible to reduce much of the first trimester of the film to ten minutes and was equally effective without experiencing public patience (and stamina). <br /> <br /> I saw this film early on Saturday afternoon, with the audience of the film festival; the kind of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or non-traditional films, like a film without dialogue or movies Short or foreign films. The near-selling crowd began to sell in nearly 275 seats in the first half of the film, while the vast majority remained for "pay" (which has not actually arrived). I have never, for almost 14 years, attended any number of film, experimental and gay festivals And others, I've seen so many people moving away from the film. <br /> <br /> It was easy to cut this movie by more than half and was as effective as it was. It may also be in different directions, with a shorter operating time, and was more effective. <br /> <br /> Since it is currently present, this is not something that one can easily recommend or I could have no desire to see again.
