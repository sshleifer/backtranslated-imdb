The black man becomes a rich white man, and the rich white man seems to embrace the culture of hip-hop, and most of the "ridiculous" moments of this film explode. My problem is that it does not work and never succeeds. <br /> <br /> Well, so no one expects Lance to take on such a body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I will give it. But at the same time, go too far in the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a rich white man who sings rap music and plays a very volatile role. I play as if he were a hip hop hub, and people just accept him. What about Sontee, who is in love with him as a rich white man? ? This is unbelievable at all, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> I could not stop kufr and could not finish the film. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even hard, several times. But I could not beat everything "white man who does hip hop" which did not happen well in any film I saw trying it. This was no exception.
