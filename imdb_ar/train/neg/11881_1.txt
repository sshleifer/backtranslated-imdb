This film does not look like "office space" except in the foreground. The space office was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I laughed once throughout the entire film. Mr. Cornbuth's own slandering self-indulgence soon became more disturbing than the 15 Jason Alexander in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or see it in someone else's home so you can leave if necessary.
