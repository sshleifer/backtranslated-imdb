The best thing about camp movies in general is that you know what you expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or soap opera during the day or Jerry Springer's show: you can immediately follow the narrow plot and identify cardboard characters and watch them comfortably while all cliches are complete. However, sometimes, the director does an unexpected real job. It may be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange, or something insightful. Director Makinen is there with the best directors, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There is nothing good about it, but it can still be both cohesive. The film does not slow down just once - the action flows and the punches continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while other characters have just spent an hour in a bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so do not face the day turns into a night at all. <br /> <br /> Finally: There is a conspiracy, there, somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
