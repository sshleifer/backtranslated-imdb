The review must be from Poland for women's rights, because it finds that Catherine Young is a wonderful and historically accurate film. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a chronicler of Russia for many years, I have used YC for many years at almost every turn, especially her politically correct portrayal as a leader who has alone moved Russia into the direction of hegemony. Truth? She was brought to St. Petersburg only to be a wife and mother, and found that she had to "associate" with Dvorian, the boys and the army just to survive. As long as she did not challenge her, she was able to allow her to drown her cultural desires (filling artitag with artistic treasures, etc.). There are so many proofs that they were not "fantastic", but in this area of ​​postmodernist moderation guide is not very popular. YC is nothing but a fashion drama, and a bit of fluff from Ted Turner, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how badly Russia portrayed in the West.
