This must be one of the worst 5 films ever produced. The plot seemed as interesting as that of the 57 passengers. But with the last film, the performance was much better. The plot was put in the worst possible way. Just a few terrifying moments in the film, a flight attendant stands at the open entrance of the 747 and tries to close the door without absorbing 250 miles per hour. The plane then lands a few miles from 8,000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When they are on the runway (quite directly of course), they are drawn on the plates, huh !! Come on the boards are there to ensure the lift at low speeds, when you use the runway in reverse and give the maximum power! I can continue to make some small and big mistakes in the film, but then it will become my size as an English dictionary. This is the movie you want to miss, take my words for it!
