Unquestionably ambitious science fiction by Kerry Conran, who is obviously a loving work. Unfortunately it's not good. Everything begins well enough - with an epic but constrained outcome, and a combination of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and brilliant cinematic photography for Spielberg. The film also refers to numerous science fiction novels, series and films such as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. However, the film fails to be as good as any of these for several reasons: the most important is that it is a hard work of love, very interested in throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, and Conran forgets actually making a film. There is not much tension, atmosphere or magic presented here despite air battles, dinosaurs and opposing groups for the race. So the noir items fall off. This is a broad way of looking at objects - although these elements fail primarily because nothing seems real at all and is clearly fake - the green screen looks like a half-time video game and the actors are clearly pasted. . Actors do not have to do much - Jude Law Wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is lost - all because of a bad scenario - the kind that should explain almost everything. It is a decent experience and some may feel nostalgic but in the end it is a meaningless step in the world of yesterday. Nice ending though.
