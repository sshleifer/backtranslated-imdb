The story relates to the genealogist (Mill Harris) who was hired by her aunt, Queen of Estee Lauder. Her aunt (by marriage, let's assume) tries to trace her long-lost family in Europe. All they have to go is a picture of a little girl standing next to a fancy music box. The researcher travels to Europe and is researched in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scene is the real thing and is actually filmed on site (unlike a murder, she wrote where Jessica is supposed to visit an elusive language and never left Lansbury Burbank). In any case, she meets a young man who is also looking for a solution to his family's mystery and is meeting together to track the clues and threaten the bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw this because of the scene but the script was so bad that I just stayed to see if it would get worse. I did. He was also acting off. I can see why the career of Mel Harris never started after thirty things, but it's enough (it seems too old for her co-star). However, players are supporters outside the community court directly. I also lost the number of times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is clear Bood-a-pesht. We know, okay? I realized in the middle of the film that this must be one of these Harlequin films and certainly enough. I think you say it all.
