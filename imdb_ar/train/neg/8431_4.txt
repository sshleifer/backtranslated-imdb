Although actors do a convincing job playing losers on the screen, the fact that these characters can not be identified has made me look at my watch only 20 minutes from the movie (and more than once). The development of the plot is disjointed and slow, verbal diarrhea of ​​the only friend of the main character is practically incurable, and the basic quality of most of the characters' behaviors and the arrogant manner in which they treat them are troublesome. <br /> <br /> It is usual for Ventura Bones to put psychologically disabled persons. However, this pseudo-social analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where they misrepresent and despise each other for good reasons of incorporation during this film. At AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow the meanings of truly abnormal intelligence because it haunts a woman who is very depressed and separate. This is supposed to be due to depression but the text does not support it. Will not I give up the rest of the story just in case there is a masochist there? Does he deal with his obsession or is the woman shocked by her depression through his constant attention? Although I saw everything I did not care about it for a moment about either. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome all this bias, ignorance, betrayal, bad dialogue, phantom philosophy, etc. ?? The camera worked well and seemed to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. It seems that the make-up was also designed to show these guys in a rude and fun light because it's the worst I've ever seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (while she's a really attractive person). <br /> <br /> I suppose whether the idea is that we must force us to see the lower classes of society so that we are grateful because we are not part of them, so Pons achieved his goal. The almost identical sex scenes were a waste of cinema (if the actors were filmed but once in blue green clothes the background could have been changed by studio effects for a small fee). It is true that I heard a lot of male audience flocking in their seats during this but objective viewing was not the real goal of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourselves and see something else.
