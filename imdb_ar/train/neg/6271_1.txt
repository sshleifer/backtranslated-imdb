There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can turn personal things into silver balls that enter the victim's mouth, killing them or turning them into zombies. It's all so shaky it's amazing. There is also a girl with a PC in her room and a computer talking by hand doll !!!!!!!! I do not make these things. The computer also controls things like cars, although nothing connects the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> "The Movie" is a complete trash can. Surreal garbage is bad. Amazing, bad garbage one of a kind. There are lots of sex scenes thrown here and there, which are not hot or very exciting. There is even one scene where women seem to make love or want to accept French tarantulas, which made me trade on the floor. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the worst movies I've ever made. THERE WITH BOARDINGHOUSE DIFFERENT VIDEO EXACTLY TO THE HOUSE, OR BOOGEYMAN II (WIGHTMARE WEEKEND AND BOOGEYMAN II HAVE SHOWS WITH A FANTASTIC TOOTHBET!). At least, it's fun to watch it and try to understand what's going on.
