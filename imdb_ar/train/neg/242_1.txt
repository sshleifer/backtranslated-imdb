From a weak plot line it hardly makes sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the end, the bad behavior (even Peter Falk can not find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better than wasted. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or passion as with her co-stars, William Ross as his brother Hank and David Coppett as lovers of Noah's love. Jennifer Bisana In the role of Socorro, the only daughter of Abu Noah can not bear to watch her let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with such materials? Screenplay by Michael J. Murray is an event at best. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time, I look at the TV guides and eagerly wait for the advent of some classic Christmas movies and truly inspirational holidays on the small screen. Movies like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernest Lubitch "Walk Around the Corner" and of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There are classics Frank Capra "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Know John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is through advice. It would be better to spend your time searching for these movies instead of searching for "Find John Christmas". Happy Birthday!
