Thanks for killing the franchise with Turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film absorbs on many levels it is pathetic. The first game of VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget replenishment makes me inconsiderate. <br /> <br /> John Bon Jovi (the poor man Kevin Bacon) wanders around Mexico with a surfboard featuring a hidden cabin carrying his own equipment to kill vampires the state of the Banderas guitar in Desperado. He picks up some lame "hunters" along the way (including an annoying female infertile girl who takes the pill from the vampire switch), and she starts off some vampires who have not given any background and therefore we can care less about Her quest (walking in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing rituals to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first vampires, I've seen this already and have done much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter was responsible for many bad movies recently. Frankly, I think he has passed his term unable to make another horror film. His only decent film since The LIVE (1987) is Vampire. Everything else is a complete crap, down to the incredibly cheap-looking and retarded Martian ghosts ... and now this is a waste of cellulite. Where are great people like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), and fled from New York and something? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace has proved that he can not write his way from a paper bag with his paper - the text line loaded with yawns, recycled grooves and mugs from the original. Did you mention that I hated every character in the film? There was not one memorable character in the entire film. How does this happen? This movie has nothing to recommend. Not even a good DVD show; the menu looked awful. <br /> <br /> By comparison, JASON X: "The 13th Friday in Space" was a wonderful masterpiece. Now this is how you make a supplement and (re) activate privilege, ladies and germs, in addition to creating an exciting DVD menu.
