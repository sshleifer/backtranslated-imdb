I know that John Singleton is a smart guy who made Boys in the Hood, so how did he write this out? It's like a bad teen soap pilot "going to college for the first time," a display of boring stereotypes and militias with some unwarranted violence to make it a commercial show, I think. Who would have thought that a rape victim would get rid of sausages for seafood? A group of neo-Nazis will be exposed to the angry unit (and will be surrounded by black and Jew - just laugh!) And until the scary retrospective of Laurence Fishburne, the professor and the love of the man annoyed me, like all the participants in this film just lost the plot. Except Busta rhymes, of course. Big ups.
