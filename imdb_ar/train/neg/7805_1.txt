The actor's first film is usually something that can be missed - this is often the first action in which the lack of film experience is presented by all participants, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this is even worse by 1982, it's very funny. He has been filmed entirely in the Chicago area with a clearly small budget. Most of the actors' representation is solid, rough and formal - a cross between a high school play and a bad community theater. The noise from nearby traffic often causes the dialog to bypass, and the dialog box is really bad, where the ad is so complex that it is forced, appropriate, not natural, and organic. The scenes are contrived and volatile, and although characters go on for years, children and adults do not advance at all. <br /> <br /> I think it is possible to produce a Christian film with a large and secular audience, but the authors often focus on the "message" or, in this case, their own autobiography so that the values ​​of good film production are neglected. (I'm sure it's no accident that the main character has the same product name / director / editor - and cast member.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was more interesting - and believable - watching his films Subsequent. Surely careers like him are not built on films like this.
