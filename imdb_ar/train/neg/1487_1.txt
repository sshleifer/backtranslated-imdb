Thanks to this film, I can now answer the question, "What's the worst film I've ever seen?" Bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing works at all in this movie. The name of one item of any horror film and the failure of this film. Frankly, I've seen the best on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not joking." "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "Arggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
