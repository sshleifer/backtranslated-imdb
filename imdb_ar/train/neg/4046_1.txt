What an insult to the film industry SA! I've seen the best SA movies. The comments I've read about Hejak's stories, saying she deserves ten out of every ten, are very scary. "OH, a movie from a developing country, allows you to enhance its industry by saying nice things about its work, even if it's bad." We have experience in making good movies. Do not judge the film industry based on what people say how great they think they hijack stories. We can tell wonderful stories such as the cry of the beloved country and Shaka Zulu. Cry of the beloved state I will give 9 out of 10. A great guide from Daryl, great acting by two older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 out of 10. Only people who are participating in the project may be awarded high marks. I had done the same thing if it was my film.
