Warning the following spoilers. Fantastic recreation for the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film occurred. Otherwise, defamation! , Scandal! It was shot in Canada presumably by a largely Canadian cast and cast. The last half of this film was recently picked up on international television here in Canada. There is nothing I can say except what I was absolutely appalled about as I was in a blatant portrayal of American historical editorialism; and the starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian-born director Roger Sputiswood was forced to make the American Air Force heroes of the film when he was actually the real saviors are a small private airline based in Calgary; Ken Burke Air.
