I tried twice to pass this film, and it succeeded the first time - it was like pulling teeth - and failed the second time despite moving a large DVD. the problem? It's simply too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene, which deals with much of the second half of the film, I've made it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting conversations by Abraham Lincoln (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The finish touches as Lincoln sets out and sets the statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, good-behaved story like this ... but it lacks the spark of the first half and discourage its determination. The viewer is hanging out there. I think Apple Lincoln was more interesting than this film.
