If you expect to see a lot in the Altıoklar bath, as promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed when you see that the film consists only of the popular style Altıoklar with regard to most famous issues such as sex, marriage and cheating. Much of the nudity, which appears to be from nowhere and has nothing to do with the plot, proves that Altıoklar did not succeed in "experimenting with something new" as reported. It seems that sex-focused jokes show that Altıoklar has fallen because of the famous proverb "sex sale". I hope I see a very good story recounted in a very good narrative style. But in the end, I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and watching Altıoklar pilot experiment so far I did not focus too much on popular work.
