Do not make a mistake, it's a terrible film, tacky, but it's fun for Olivia Hossy lovers - it's probably the most charming beauty on the silver screen. One of the posters said it was unpleasant to look at - and I wonder how his ideal wife looks - Paris Hill is slutty? Blockbuster should really create a sub-genre for this type of film, as Fatal Attraction has become a sort of thing in itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit very well between drama and action sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hossy, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have killed his ex-wife, who looks as wonderful as Mrs Hasey. This new game progresses to Olivia's leg and thus makes her life a living hell. I like Olivia Hossy, but I do not sympathize with the characters in the movies that cheat on their husbands, so I really did not get to Olivia to make her out of this stinking alive. <br /> <br /> Violence: $$ (There is little violence in the film Don Murray and Anthony John Denison are implicated in moral fits when Denison says he will never stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she is very good in bed. Also the shooter has been pressing out of the tour - I'll let you watch). <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$ (Olivia is the Queen of Short Nudity and provides her here a little bit.) She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and has a shower scene - filmed from a distance. <br /> <br /> The story: $ (We have seen this plot before - more than a hundred times, sometimes it performed much better.The culprit, when trying to decipher the cause of this film, is William Reid, the man's dialogue was adventurous and adventurous, A man does not have the abilities to tell stories and fails to build up the beliefs of a viable human reaction to the conspiracy.These people, from the upper classes of society, speak like middle school kids - with a habit of sleeping during English lessons.Riead has put in the " Can not be seen again. "<br /> <br /> Representation: $$$ (representation was not" contacted "as insiders say, but were A lot of Reed's scenario of events, Olivia Hossy resorting to calling Anthony John Denison "weird" and "crazy" on his face when he begins to chase her, and offer Hase, still beautiful, the best performance here but Denison was equal to the task of filming a passionate passionate pursuer , Don Murray was basically present - his character did not materialize, and Edward Asner, a wonderful actor when he gave something with the content, not used badly in this film).
