this movie . . . I do not know, I do not know. Why would they take such an indelible character as Pippi Longstocking and play the unique Tami Erin character, I will never know. Why spend money on artistic direction and some special bad influences, and then will not bother to adjust it correctly, I will never know. Why are groups and costumes sometimes, sometimes not strange, why they commissioned SUCH with bad songs, and why the text has no meaning at all (not even at the level of silly children's movies). . . . As they were thinking ?? Nothing about this film is exactly as it should be. Each single part is called (and always bad), each sound effect is slightly wrong, each adjustment is in the wrong place, each performance is somehow bad. He is able to create a suitable atmosphere, despite all the problems, but he does not pick up the magic that is created Astrid Lindgren.
