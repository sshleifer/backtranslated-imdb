You know the type of film you enter when the main character of the serial killer is transferred to the electric chair (apparently a truck for the bakeries), just to collide with the prison car (and I do not manufacture it). Which causes its solubility, and integrates its DNA with the ice, creating our protagonist, the Snowman Killer. <br /> <br /> However, the favorite part of the film is a shot above the shoulder of a snowman who smashes some poor Chmagh, as his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
