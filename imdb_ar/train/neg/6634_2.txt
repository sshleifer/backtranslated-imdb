The first look at the cover of this picture, looks like a rock and roll movie. But do not let the hood fool you, or the fact of Alice Cooper and Blondy. The story is just appalling, as well as acting. Easy and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a roadie movie, it's just a thin love story, so awful you can see it directly. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some songs are good, that is why I give 2 out of 10. If not for music, the result will be 0 out of 10. Actor (at least it was in 1980), the girl who plays the role of a group is not so good! This film was a big disappointment to me, because it offers a lot of good promises.
