It is a small ugly production, suitable for giving one nightmares in addition to headaches. It's an ugly mix of live motion and ugly animation to stop the movement. It's weird, but it's not a kind of fun, a strange journey anyone might expect. It is cold, inhuman, unfriendly, nausea, a strange kind of creeping. There is no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a great job with the same source material. Cosgrove-Hall made things more attractive by stopping motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the stereotype that the French do not have a scary concept.
