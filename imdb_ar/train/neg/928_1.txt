This movie is very terrible, hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At first, the story was very silly. A narrow-minded person can write a better plot! The actors are boring and uneducated, probably forced to play in this cheese film. <br /> <br /> National Forest reception is the best in this entire movie. I must be ashamed, because I paid for this poor picture. <br /> <br /> We hope that no one will make a sequel or make a similar film with a worse story like :-)
