Wonderful. This film bored me when I saw it. Nice, meaningless and not moving. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash & Co. He can travel through time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest"? There, they meet a reckless child called Sam, and the "conspiracy" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ashe) and Hack (Sam) are in love with nature and become hippies and try to free Selby (the "soul") from some eccentric fisherman. I do not even know what happened. Everything went in a blur. The ash friends were barely there, and all the scenes of the fighting were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ashe and his ominous friends must return to their time, while watching Sam float away with Celebi (this scene was just creepy .OO;) Then, after returning to their time, learns that his new friend is In fact his grandfather is his rival. I think that's all. Too backward, is not it? If you love your kids, you will not be exposed to it. (1 of 10.)
