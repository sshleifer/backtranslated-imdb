Whale hunters choose a strange strange whale. <br /> <br /> A group of Yahoo whale exploiters pick up a female and stitch them with a tail fin. The companion of the whale sees the whole thing, including the moment when the unborn child slides down and falls on the deck. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) can tell us that the big guy is really crazy about the way he looks at her as if to say, "Get out of town before the high tide." <br /> <br /> This revenge story has the presence of Harris and Jamal Bo, but not so much. This was Bo's first film, "Bo," although her first acting role was four years ago in "Once Upon Love", released in 1981 as "The Illusions" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the history of this review (November 20), is the birthday of Derek Bo. I hope Bo has a "whale" in a good time ..... I get it? Whale? ..... hee hee.
