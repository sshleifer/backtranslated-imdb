I will not go and give them $ 10 I went and bought the fourth season of the original and better. At least my children enjoy it and can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are silly and prefer to watch the original. She believes that Jessica Simpson Daisy is really awful she thinks she is more like a slut than a Daisy Duke. Those shorts that you may not wear at all. Since the American pancake has nothing to do with the Shami Dukes they have to put this bad line there about sex with a car. This in itself must have earned a R movie rating. The only good thing that might come out of this movie is a reunion film with the original. Lets all hope. So people will see there who went and watched the film how it should have looked
