Cannon pulled the real visual beauty of the medieval epic that looked fantastic (except for the Dragon's Pillar). Now how did the long-known studio, known as Chuck Norris, come out with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? An example: an amateur and terrible plot is a sign that the revival of the medieval legend is not a cure for some poor execution. They have already gone and made another cheap exploiter of hundreds of energetic bimbo, just to make this shape better. For the Barbarian brothers, they know exactly how to make strange sounds from becoming brave warriors with the strength and courage to save their native land. This is the biggest waste of the possibilities I've seen from a "high-cost" film with a low budget, and even worse, allowing an opaque print with no mercy. All this came after an advertising campaign sold t-shirts based on barbarians! The film alone makes a great memorial!
