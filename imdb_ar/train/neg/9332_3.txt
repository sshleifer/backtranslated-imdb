It is not a terrible film, really, Glenn and Kittel are first class actors. Moreover, they do acceptable work using very weak script. The scene is rich in plot and has some interesting transformations. In addition, I understand why these actors and crew produced the film. They are professional and paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend the time and money to produce a movie and then do not cast it on the audience theater? Even if the film flops at the box office, it certainly earns some money. If you love Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or take it on TV, as I Granted, the film will not help solve the migration dilemma with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard TV fare today.
