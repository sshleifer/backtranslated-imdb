"Unhinged" is a strange little film, forgotten and forgotten of the golden age of this genre. It's really hard to write a satisfactory review of this film just because the film is unique. It is a somewhat exaggerated plot - three young women on their way to a rock concert in a car accident and ending up in the wall at the palace of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, ladies realize that something is not quite right when they hear the breath and anger of the attic. Moreover, the mother and daughter seem to have a very strange relationship, quarreling in front of their house at dinner. The old mother goes so far as to describe her daughter as a slut prostitute and accuses her of sneaking into her men at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the film, when a final girl decides she is wandering better to find help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As for representation, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. The three stranded girls can not act, especially the "leading" girls. It is almost unreasonable to hear them delivering their lines in the same color throughout the film. Mother and daughter are better, but not so much. The film is very boring in some parts and really lasts. The killings are appalling, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as we have mentioned here, the film really wins points with its disturbing and brilliant ending. It comes entirely from the left field and has the same shock value as the classic "Sleepaway Camp" exit. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a cavity and suffers from horrible, tedious, tedious and tedious representation. The secluded palace, the creeping appearance, and the vibrant dark lighting give the film a realistic, loving effect, but this is quickly broken when one of the characters tries to act. It may be worth it if you can stick it to the end, but I say you're better off in quick re-routing to the last 10 minutes. 4 of 10
