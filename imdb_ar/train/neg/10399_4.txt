One of the main drawbacks of this film is that although the ridicule of the subcontractors is gratifying, it fails to realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being those who deserve to ridicule them. One of the characteristics of these yuppie species is cone misunderstanding as they (the yuppies) are only sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and focuses instead on their misinterpretation, I find it ironic that only those who enjoy the film enjoy the taste of the film as the characters do for their dinner. If these great characters were in this film containing a video library at home, I bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
