I hired this one to see Vanessa Talor again. They can act, but do not get a chance at this claw. The opening sequence is a superb crane shot of mountain landscapes. You must come from the stock archive, because the movie is filmed directly on the video. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a really cheesy bust, but no other effects are worth noting. This film is bad, but it is not. It's good to mention players in their autobiography.
