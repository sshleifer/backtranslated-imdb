Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading on the internet that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time and I had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really amazed me is the editing, or lack of it. Again and again, the characters appear (usually the narrator and whoever is with him) walking ... walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can move between someone who leaves point A to show his arrival to point B. There is no need to show the whole trip almost! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling rather sorry for the actors involved. They seem to have given no direction on what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on the procedure to be added later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why decide to do all effects using CG almost. Even ILM is still used in miniatures sometimes. One of the most green screen uses for distraction in this film is the constant acceleration in (according to final appropriations) of the same group of people representing citizens of different cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these people come and go without regard to the angle of the shot or the distance they inhabit the camera. In one of the shots in London, it seems that there are at least six feet of men walking behind the brother of the narrator (star Anthony plays a statement without a drinker distracting him). I have not seen since GETTYSBURG such a fake piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Heinz talked about this film the way he did it. It is Turkey, easy and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most cheerful parts I've seen in a long time.
