After the first 25 minutes promising to make you feel warm from the inside, you are fully convinced that this will be a wonderful romantic comedy. Then the film takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> There may still be a warm feeling, but as others have said: the plot becomes so unreasonable and artificial that it can not be seen. <br /> <br /> The movie speeds up, and you get the impression that you're either quickly redirecting it, or that the producers have decided to hold it in less than 1 hour and 40 minutes and had to cut a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a viewer, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, but just happening. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this film has some nice interior designs, and despite the bad scenario, I think the performance of the actors is basically good. If I could only estimate the first 25 minutes, he might have given it eight minutes. As it is now, it gets four. ... that's cute! <br /> <br /> If you're a romantic comedy pacifier, you're likely to have a great time anyway. If not, I would recommend watching something else.
