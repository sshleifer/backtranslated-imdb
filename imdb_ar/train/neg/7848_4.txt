The film was just plain stupid, I do not think it was scary at all, I wish I was shocked and scared, but I was mostly laughing, some scenes were just fake and thrown together, the blood scenes were more than CG and some of the mutants were gay The irony also looks sucked because the acting was just awful I think they can get some good actors and most of the characters just hated because they acted stupid and lame even if they were supposed to be in the army I get to watch the movies for free and watched a lot of people come out of guessing Because I was so stupid I was rather happy and did not have to To pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE I do not see it ... but again, this is my opinion
