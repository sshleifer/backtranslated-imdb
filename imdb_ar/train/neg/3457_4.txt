This film was produced and delivered from my hometown. I remember the uproar about this and the whole Hulapalo about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... <br /> <br /> The story ... <br /> <br /> Basically 20 years after "Putting the movie to rest" Don To end, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences.It seems that someone does not want to complete the film. <br /> <br /> The story of the story is flimsy, one must remember that this is a comedy and therefore should be taken a bit From cheek to cheek, but it has no real attraction.The characters are mostly transperant and the few information you receive about you just do not care about them, it seems irrelevant.It is strange to hear Kelly's tone as Australian again and It's nice to see a child who went to school with him in a starring role, but that does not replace the film at all, but he knows why Makers thought they would get Molly Ringwald, maybe because of the nature of the film. The Australian would have done well. <br /> <br /> As far as the sound is concerned, the acting seems to be holding in. It seems that some of these children (especially the two main boys - played the director and the producer) were trying to act. This is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough sense about her. Maybe more lit up? Not as smooth as one used to. <br /> <br /> The killer. Lord. Could it be less scary? There are some shock factors, two total scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. I went for 90 minutes but could go for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. Many people have been killed - but not really killed. Maybe if they killed fewer people and actually focused on a scary atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's comedy and funny elements. Or incredible they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
