Save Grace is definitely one of the top contenders for the "How to Destroy a Film in a Few Minutes" award. Of course, if you mix a strange Corniche village - largely populated by retired women - with a liberal dose of marijuana, it will entail a certain amount of stupidity. However, the last seven minutes of the film are completely ridiculous and are not even replaced by being particularly funny. It's a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be as good as Waking Ned Devine for 1998, which also portrayed a picturesque little village and its curious inhabitants trying to extricate themselves from a difficult position. <br /> <br /> The protagonist to save Grace is middle-aged, widow Grace Trevethyn recently, whose husband's legacy of bad debt forced her to unconventional way to make money. With the help of her gardener, Matthew turned her horticultural experience into a lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads to a confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . All of them bring in their greenhouse home at one time. The relationship and the connection between Grace and Matty are well portrayed, and Brenda Blythin gets on the scenes of emotional sharing with her beloved personality - you can really feel what she is going through. <br /> <br /> The choice of secondary roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather eccentric. However, Jack Syed's drug shift to Grace's romantic interest is largely unbelievable and does not fit into the tone of the film at all. Certainly aquaculture is not such a revolution in the growing world of cannabis? Unfortunately, the film exchanges pleasant humor with a slap and ends up as a marijuana plant.
