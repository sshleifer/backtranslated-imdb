The only reason I have seen in the movie "Shakedown" is that they carry Erika Eleniak. She's as exciting as ever, but she plays the role of the second violin of the lead man Wolf Larson. It's unfortunate, because they have more mobility capabilities than they allow them to show up here. The film is largely made up of endless releases that quickly turn monotonous - especially when you see the bad guys armed with machine guns always missing Larson and armed only with a pistol (bullets will never run out) fairly easily. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there is also a lot of motion blur and poor CGI explosions. As the "spiritual leader" of my mind, Ron Perleman tries, but the fake religious jumbo mumbo that he has to utter is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson (assuming he has any) may want to look at this, but for others it is hardly worth leasing. (* 1/2)
