Synopsis: According to the legend, Valkyrie challenged Bronchilde Oden and was chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only a pure warrior in the heart can pass through fire, release Braunhilda and release her from Odin's claim, and get her for himself. Now, brewing war in the Scandinavian territory, the king needs to ally with the raiders. The Berserkers are warriors called Falkins Odin, who crave war, blood and flesh, and are therefore outcasts, but superior in battle. The leader of Berserkers is a son who ridiculed the king, the pig, and his price for the alliance is his brother, future king, Barek. But after the king's victory in battle, he refuses to give up his only surviving son, breaking his right on the pig, betraying him and killing him. The pig is saved only by calling Barek on Odin. But this is only the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to begin now, after thousands of years ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I hope this movie depends on some ground Viking, film quality is very little about Viking has been done. It looked very good, with long ships and detailed armor, beautiful scenery, and a good battle. <br /> <br /> The foundation of the legends is thin and thin and seems to be very damaged for me. Odin is far more vengeful than the hatred and anger I remember from school, and the mud has turned into some vampire demons. I'm not an expert, but that sounds totally wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake of this film is to transfer the time from the original time to the day. If the Brotherhood fought at the right time, with some decent battles, this film would have been much better. Now the setting, suddenly changed to Stockholm today. Odin is still present and sends a pig and his horseman for Brunhilda and Parrick, giving ridiculous scenes when armored and black attackers fight with Barrick among industries. The mountains have been exchanged and beautiful forests of cement. And when I was allowed to focus on individual battles, rather than massive battles as I did at the beginning, I quickly saw that the battles and skills of actors were slow and daring. <br /> <br /> The end result is a thin story, sometimes difficult to follow and sometimes even silly, and the only one that can save it, the action, is drawn from the slow, boring and dull battles. Very little is derived from the tradition of a prisoner or a Viking tradition. So the story and the movement fail, and the film is very bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as Cassidy, this film is a bit confusing. It is supposed to have been entirely filmed in South Africa, it still contains some of the well-known Swedish signs and paintings and what appears to be an original police car. However, the effort is lousy and goes no further, where he really put it in Sweden. There are no Swedish names (probably with Anya as an exception), no familiar scenes are Swedish, they are (supposed to) speak a little (old?) Norwegian, not Swedish. Uniforms, police and medical, obviously are not Swedes. If they are not trying to do it properly - and they really give the illusion that it was set up in Sweden, why would you care at all? <br /> <br /> 4/10
