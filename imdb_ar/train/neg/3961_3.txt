What a dog for the film. The performance of Noni Hazelhurst is very good, but it is located amidst a forest of hateful text writing, medium direction and wooden representation of the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are shamefully shameful, especially Colin Freless. <br /> <br /> Very little work is done in this buzz trash. Much of the "personal development" is done through a silly and angry voice, often completely contradicting the characters' behavior on the screen. In fact, it's so hard to know who is talking about the sound because they describe these different characters to whom we see on screen! How did we mean to know that Colin Javo was meant to be a sinful, violent and unreliable addict? One of these silly voice sums tells us. For the loud shouting way, the nature of his character is half the point of the film, and the only thing that lets us know is that the turning sound is over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are completely preserved and look new from the shelf, although we always mention that they are supposed to be professional artists. They all talk silly about "junkies." None of them seems to have any real understanding of life on skis or strikes, but that's the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than a daily TV movie. Such rough, well shot and technically presented, but an angry drama based on cliches shooting wide range from being reasonable and curving for hours without going anywhere. At least, Noni gets her birthday suit at every opportunity. There is no other rational reason to tolerate this unwanted.
