I checked this on a DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this awful film unfolds. Every time you think it can not get worse, it's inevitable. The representation is very shocking. The plot is meaningless at all. The title "Cold Revenge" in the US DVD version has nothing to do with the script. It is clear that the action scenes are taken in the first snapshot. There are a lot of mistakes during the dialogues which indicate that there is no intention to do another work to try to make this film possible at least. I can not remember seeing a worse film and sometimes getting bad movies - okay, except what can not be stopped using Wesley Snipes. No, who am I joking, while it's bad, the best picture awards at the Oscars can not be stopped when compared to this piece of nonsense.
