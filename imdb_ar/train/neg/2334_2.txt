This had high intellectual excuses. The main aim was to give a "profound" "meaningful" presentation (with the sound of his mental appearance naturally) and was certainly influenced by the "1950s / 1960s" style - which, when the text was interesting, gave remarkable results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But the story here is very bad. Besides moving too slowly, you can modify at least 20 minutes - including past memories that are useless - and the plot line will not be changed. At times, it is doubtful that Bruce Derrin believes in his character "Uncle" and his portrayal is often a parody. There is an interesting aspect that only recedes: the relationship between the boy / hero - if we recognize that the hero is the same kind of child - when he tells the little boy that he will not let anyone hurt him, show some tender affection. But it is a failure and only the last scene is returned to it. <br /> <br /> A word for the wise: Take Foley "from close range" instead: it has great actors (Christophe A Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an odd, but impressive, film.
