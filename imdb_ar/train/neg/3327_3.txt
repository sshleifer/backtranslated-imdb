Two brothers and their deviant brother and cousin have a problem with the car. They then talk about Dr. Hackenstein's house, which needs the body parts of three young women to be used for an attempt to bring his deceased lover back to life. Tell them that it will help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. After that, the good doctor starts working in this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this to be a little entertaining, nothing to get me out of my way (I stumbled upon an instant show of Netflix and broadcast it to the Xbox 360), but I'd rather expect Troma to be. Most humor does not work, but some parts still made me smile. In addition to the late, Ann Ramsay has a small part and has always seen him. <br /> <br /> The candy eye: Bambi Darrow and Sylvia Lee Becker Naked <br /> <br /> My estimate: D +
