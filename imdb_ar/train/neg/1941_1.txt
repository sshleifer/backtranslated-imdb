I can not believe I wasted five hours of my life on this garbage. The presentation of the last five days of this author was very interesting and I was looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit because she either mumbled or dropped her lines, but most of her team followed her example. The notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, the old players who had a perfect example. Do producers listen to products before they are broadcast to make sure the dialogue is heard? As a result, I assume that I lost track of what was going on, and that the original plot seemed to have turned into the usual thing between Muslims and the others who had lost interest in it soon. The end was complete to combat the climax. The dud is complete.
