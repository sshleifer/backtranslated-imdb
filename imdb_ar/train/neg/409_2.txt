<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven has finally bombed this. He became a joke on himself. Again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, and mockery of women, and a lot of talk is discussed between characters and segments. <br /> <br /> Everything is for nothing. Because there is absolutely no work in this film. She candy all the pieces set for her. All actors give this kind of film Verhoeven performances. In other words rampant to work on almost every level. The spacecraft soldiers faded because it was like a macho world populated figures. In these scientists behave in the same way. Sorry, Paul, but the soldiers and the world do not really make the same mentality. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of this plot was that after escaping that night to do evil things, Kevin Bacon's character would then return to science. The exercise, where we have already spent more than enough time watching these animated manuscripts (except for Elizabeth Choi), is walking and speaking. Why not show how much personality can do in the outside world. How could he follow him if he could be anywhere at all ?? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, in terms of story and characterization. Then look at what this movie does and you really are how poorly the entire project performs and hide it. <br /> <br /> More insults is Doco on the DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a type of Genius MAd. Well, one of the two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This movie contains nothing. Just as the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
