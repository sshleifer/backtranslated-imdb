I did not know whether I would laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history, especially the damage done to the history of the cavalry police in Yukon. <br /> <br /> I will leave it to Pierre Burton, a historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the final history of Gold Clondike Peak, Clondike: The Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my indignation at this ridiculous film: The American idea continued unabatedly, defeated by six armed heroes, in The Far Country, another story about cowboys from the American West - this time Wyoming - leading a herd of beef cattle to the country of gold. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibility, but real conflict is the main assumption that the plot turns into ?? That there was only one policeman installed in all the Canadian Yukon aircraft at the time of the gold rush and that he could not cope with the mess. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan arrive at the Yukon border with their livestock, the customs hut is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the policeman?" asks Brennan. <br /> <br /> "Up on the Pelly River. The problem with Chilkats, "Reacting to someone who has a really difficult job, is that the policeman is patrolling about ten or twenty thousand square miles ... Sometimes he does not return home for two or three months at a time." <br /> <br /> The historical fact is that the Yukon region during the gold rush was the closest to a police state that was never seen in North America at all. Northwest Cavalry Police stationed in the area in large numbers before the Klondike strike long. They controlled every road to Yukon and did not make any nonsense. They collected customs duties, often on newcomers, issued arbitrary regulations immediately on river navigation, returned men if they did not have enough supplies, or simply looked bad. In the true Canadian way, they put in place ethical laws for society. In Dawson the Day of the Lord was a strict law. It was a crime punishable by a fine by cutting off your cutter on Sunday; young women with heavy bodies were arrested for what the police described as "strict performance in the theater", nothing more than dancing on the stage in revealing tights. <br /> <br /> In such a society, the ammunition of Venice was unimaginable. A notorious person from Tombstone who attempted to put a weapon on his hip personally was disarmed by a young policeman who had just taken him out of a salon for a heinous crime of speaking very loudly. The bad man left as a lamb but protested when the policeman, when he discovered he was carrying a gun, ordered him to hand him over. The American said: "No man has taken his weapon yet." "Well, I'm taking it," said the policeman gently and did so, without further resistance. Many guns were confiscated at Dawson until they were auctioned for less than a dollar and purchased as a souvenir to keep the mantle. <br /> <br /> In 1898, a year of great scrambling, there was not a serious crime? Not to mention murder ?? In Dawson. The contrast with the Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, a man of confidence in Denver, was wonderful. But in The Far Country, Dawson is seen as a society without any law, the character of Soapy Smith of Skagway ?? Called Gannon in the picture ?? Can be easily controlled. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border confiscated all his equipment and was met again by a police sergeant.) <br /> <br /> In the film, Waheed Monty says, "Yes, I am the law, I represent the law in Yukon County, about 50,000 square miles from it." <br /> <br /> "So why do not you have more of you?" <br /> <br /> "Because it was wild yesterday, we did not expect you to flow in the thousands, and now that you are here, we will protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "There will be a publication created here in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? Will you be here to keep order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" What about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose yourself a good man "I swear to him, make him act as a guard?" <br /> <br /> Mountie leaves and does not reappear in the picture. His amazing suggestion ?? That an American Marshall town, complete with a tin star, would be sworn by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence? Accepted. Of course they want to make Jimmy Stewart the Marshal. It fits clearly part. But Stuart plays the role of the only person taking care of the first number, so another man is elected to get shot. He does. Others get shot. So Walter Brennan gets fired. Stuart finally came to a reluctant conclusion that all shooting must end with some shooting on his own. Attached to the tin star is the bully, Gannon, exploding at each other at the inevitable West Peak. <br /> <br /> For anyone with a passing knowledge of North Canada, this bald story goes through a rational belief. <br /> <br /> ??
