I was working on rooting this film because it is a new version of a television series for children in the seventies of the twentieth century entitled "Escape to the night," although it was strange and chaotic sometimes strange and wonderful and disturbing. Representation in the wooden "Paperhouse", inadvertently a joke. I did not add excessive doses of tension but it reinforced that I was sitting watching the monitor. Pour the gloomy dialogue that led to relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or condemnation. As in most bland films, there are some good supporting actions that these people should rest and comfort and rest assured they will not take responsibility. Of all possible endings, the most unexpected things were chosen ... lame than I dreamed of. <br /> <br /> Worth the "Escape to the Night" remake appropriate, written by someone with life experience and brilliantly oriented mind.
