This was a very bad show. Sucked the writing, the dialogue sucked. The person who played Craig could not act from a paper bag. Being it on a Thursday evening, this was definitely great to watch some beer. Great music, bad acting, bad writing, all met for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a dramatic / unintended comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, they were all dull and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, they could not identify the victim, and they had to write the dialogue around him, which was terrible. I mean, the funeral at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that took place at the present time were very appalling. <br /> <br /> So let's review it. Everything that happens at present is sucked. Flashback scenes, sucked only writing, dialogue and acting Craig. She ruled the music though.
