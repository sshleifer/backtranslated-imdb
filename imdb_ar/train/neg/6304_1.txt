As a Portuguese for the history of the Second World War, and someone who is not proud of the history of the ethnic relations of this country, I was looking forward to seeing this film. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I managed to reach about 3/4 of the road, but I had to turn it off at the sub-attack site. The idea that a U-boat launches a torpedo on DDE, as if there is hope to hit it, and then be able to "escape" from DDE while immersed, is a rewarding idea. This is just a small detail. The whole film was poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly behaved. I agree with others in this forum that it could have been a good film. It seems as though they have decided that, since all the crazy propaganda films in World War II were made in entirely white forms, they needed to make a film with black people. And as bad as those old movies, this is even worse. There is almost a slap in the wrong headlines in the headlines of Yossi Davis and Stephen Rhea. It turns out that they have very small roles. I must believe that these two good actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I am done. The way has paved much of my life this film crap.
