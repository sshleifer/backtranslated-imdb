This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, which itself is wonderful, but not this. Wherever I have not seen Mil Brook's name here, and I can guess why, it has become more logical not to be associated with this pilot. Judy, who will find this funny. Sure, there might be a problem with the race, but to me it was not funny, well, it's simply not funny. It seems as if the writers did not even try to be funny, just to take advantage of their association with Blazing Saddles. Did you expect this offer to last for several seasons when they did this pilot? Outside the apartment, did not care. I have been a quick cash cow and thankfully I have not spent. I think it's useful for historical purposes only, or just to show how Hollywood can be stupid and unimaginable.
