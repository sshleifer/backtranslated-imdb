The film looked as if it might have been good at first, but never predicted its expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical for Asian directors), but does not know how to create or narrate a good story to keep up with. The story was fragmentary and seemed to explode in all sorts of different directions during the film, and never found a solid angle to be interpreted and interesting. Essentially, the film is totally inappropriate for press releases. The acting was very good, however. All the actors made good performances, and Jude Lu was as wonderful as ever. It is very bad that he chose to do this weak film.
