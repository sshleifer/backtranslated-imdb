Oliver Hardy wakes up with a headache and soon learns that his uncle will come to see his wife and her new baby. The problem is that they do not exist - it seems I've made them Ulse! Therefore, it is up to him and his family to identify a lady with a child agreeing to appear as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a unique story idea, as I saw at least a few other silent pants with this exact plot. The best thing is Bobby Vernon. It's much better than ONE TOO MANY - much of it may have been due to the fact that it was produced a decade later - when comedy became a little more sophisticated and less reliant on useless futility. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some of the movies, people started shooting wildly, kicking and strangling them, etc. without any provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, this is exactly what they are doing. It makes no sense to make sense as if it had run out of ideas. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not exactly a major entertainment event. There are not enough rewards worth watching unless you are a silent obsession lover like me.
