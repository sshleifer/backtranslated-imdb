"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is the worst film ever created, surpassing even Plan 9 of Outer Space. The Lambon film fades in three separate and unrelated short essays, each with different performers. The only common thread is the complete lack of any replacement qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said the nude footage was nice, and he was right. Gansel and Dusenberry lack their assets in a great way, in the first and the second part in a row. But their shining screens are lost. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a reliable story to surround, and there is nothing on the horizon. <br /> <br /> The third part, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and a regrettable choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays a passionate young policeman, who gives a bright account of his first day, ready to rid the streets of evil. He was associated with a naive old cop by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners started their first campaign together, we felt a potential recovery of previous movie failures. Perhaps, perhaps only, the old cynical timer will be repaired by the sense of his new strong partner of duty and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily after all. Unfortunately, this film goes straight to the toilet, without redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon Goes to Movies", I thought I had already seen the worst episode Hollywood could turn into. Unfortunately, I have not seen half of it. <br /> <br />
