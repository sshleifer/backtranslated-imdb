Someone will have to explain to me why each film presents the poor and adopts a false appearance that is somewhat like "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything realistic about the characters (although the actors have done their best with really bad parts) or attitudes. Instead, I saw conscious conscious effort to be "edgy", "brave" and "down and dirty." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes more than just carrying the camera without rhyme or reason and failure to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any important way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment on the state of distribution of the independent film that the only films seen in the movie theater at present are all carbon copies, with bad cinematic photography and the direction of the camera is not there and a lot of the right that strives to pass itself on it "the art". <br /> <br /> No wonder movies like "In the Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such a rave. I found her modest and very mediocre, but compared to the current number of independent clones such as "Raising the Victor Vargas" they are absolutely wonderful and inspiring. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw an "independent" film that means that you are likely to be treated with some originality, a lot of energy and care, and perhaps some technical flaws resulting from lower budgets. For now, Another additional, let's-shake-camera-about-a-two-hour attempt to calm the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course all this to serve characters and attitudes are unrealistic and completely contradictory. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas doing nothing but copying the worst movies that preceded it.
