This is the worst movie I have ever seen !! There was nothing good at all to say about this film. I've seen some bad movies but this one takes them. There is no plot and most of the movie you either reorient the movie quickly to get it done faster or you wonder what the hell is going on because you can not seriously think that someone has thought about this movie while you are watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who should be sitting through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and do not watch this movie because I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have spent in your life.
