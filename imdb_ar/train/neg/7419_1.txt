This film was awful and insulting to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood's usual tradition, the US government is always seen as evil. The sympathizers of the Hollywood communists, most of them idiots like a box of rock, love to take the image of Eugene McCarthy as one and portray him as the leader of a broad movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a marginal figure who was exploiting the legitimate concern of Soviet communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the United States has brought all these evil Nazis. Such as Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have a space program. He really loved being an American and became a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> However, the paradox is that fools in Hollywood, a lot of uneducated people living fantastically, still believe that the government should manage everything. And give us everything we want. However, this is the same government that they consistently depict as a witty evil in such films.
