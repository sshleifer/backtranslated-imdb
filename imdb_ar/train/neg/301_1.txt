This is the worst documentary film coming out of Canada at all! I'm glad to see the guys did not make another film. All they want to do is get a film-making and not necessarily have to be the one who wrote it. Continue to change the script to suit the person promoting it. I could not get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please do not see this movie.
