really??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the glowing comments here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's one big pathetic, granular, clich√©. I was laughing loudly, and many, but I was on a date with a former military man. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my history, a "good big boy" flat, he liked it. This is not a compliment. I know that the actor wants to work .... good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful regret from Ralph. I vote 2 just because Ralph looked so amazing. But I must defend, Ralph, how can you? And why ?? <br /> <br /> I will go to see the "end of the case" for healing and recovery now .... C1
