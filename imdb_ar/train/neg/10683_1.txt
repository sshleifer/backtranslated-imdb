Some guy gets hit. Right in the sight of this other man shoot him. He has some bodyguards and beat the killer, but the reporter cares. Go to the hospital where they took the man who was beaten. She walks in one corner and picks up a bodyguard, but he does not feel he is speaking. I can not figure out why. It's not like anyone else interested. She's the only reporter there. In any case, her editor discourages her from working in this lame story. But hey, she does anyway. I went to see the sister of the killer and my mother. A few minutes after leaving, they are struck by a great time - someone is blowing up their trailers - a huge ball of fire. Then she searches for the bodyguard from the hospital. I found him hanging on his boat, but after a minute, they were both under water on the diving tank because three men were trying to hit them (they blew the boat a long time - a huge ball of fire). The journalist and the bodyguard beat two men trying to beat them. <br /> <br /> Over the next clock, another person was hit as he crossed the street, there was an exchange of fire with many trees in the warehouse, some car chases with debris and death, fake suicide, etc. Cruel, all kindsa massacre. <br /> <br /> Great things, but what the reporter and bodyguard can not determine is: Why in hell was the original man hit. What is motivation? Of course, this may help us to understand why the reporter is interested. Through almost all of this, she is the only reporter in the story. No one else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and corpses. It is true that the original man who was beaten was not exactly a celebrity. His job was a bit boring. He was the only president. Yes, the person who lives in the White House. Oh, the bodyguard is a client for secret service. <br /> <br /> Is this the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It must be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other reporters printed, no bloggers ... just one of those other police crimes. <br /> <br /> So what is the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Yummy I think ... <br /> <br /> No! wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... First Lady. It was p --- because the president was tricked around her. They go unpunished. It's really sharp, huh? But how the hell to find out? Why does anyone bother? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> Give this step a "1". It was so stupid that I had to follow. I just got stupid! This is a real spoiler! But even though I told you, you have to see her believe it!
