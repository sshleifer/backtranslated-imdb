It certainly fits the time period where Axis & Allies were playing spy games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best movie, but it's definitely not the worst budget movie as described earlier from War Classics. <br /> <br /> Rinaldo's "Cisco Kid" was very good in one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed Harry Parke (known as Parkyarkarkus). Why not get any bigger roles is beyond me. Play the role of friend / ideal partner and save the film ... Imho. <br /> <br /> As it was said, this movie was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight eight-dollar movies, which included films unheard of before, and some decent stars trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script is good ... not very good. Editing and cinematography ... worse. If you can go beyond all that and want to see Cisco Kid and the great side-end that has never truly realized its true potential, choose it! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
