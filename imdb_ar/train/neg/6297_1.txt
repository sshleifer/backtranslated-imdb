I am a big fan of Martin Ames, whose film is based on his book. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book into the screen. The novel is completely new and highly artificial in its highly bloated characters, the disintegration of the traditional plot line and the development of character. It is a hilarious test of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of Britain's most moral writers. The director of the film has missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film screams super fast, and indulges in every shot a well-known trick and "alien" camera angle are possible. He is like Kane Russell on acid, and suffers from self indulgence of the older director up to a hundred. It was not even a brief glimpse of the wonderful penis of Christian Solimino suffice to save this miserable film for me. immemorial!
