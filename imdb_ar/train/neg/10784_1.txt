It was disgusting and painful. What a waste! I swear, the audience laughed (half full) twice in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even hire them. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones meant just to believe. <br /> <br /> Kozak was fine. Just yes. I felt sorry for him (the actor) if people remembered the mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as always. Charming and sweet, but purposeless. The "romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
