The film is a very long story of a classic novel that fails to capture the original spirit of adventure. American Patrick Suese portrayed the extremely terrible British hero Alan Quatterman despite his nationality. <br /> <br /> The movie continues throughout the story to the Hollywood Ises by changing the plot and characters to a more comfortable fit in the acceptable mold. The film can be expected all the time, even for those who are not familiar with the story, as it suffers from some very bad and very disappointing combat sequences. <br /> <br /> All in all, an awesome addition to the above is a very bad collection of films based on the legend of King Solomon's Mine and Alan Quattermain.
