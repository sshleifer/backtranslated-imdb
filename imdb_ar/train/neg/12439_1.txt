The first movie "Home Alone" was one of the 90's most entertaining movies. The second was funny with the same cast and jokes! Now come "home alone 3". I was curious how they could continue in the same story, considering that Kevin was seventeen by 1997. He could take care of himself, did not he? So, what did the manager decide to do? He takes the child as annoying and makes him ill. The child is like a 6-year-old and left alone at home? What kind of burger team are these idiots? I do not really want to go into details if you want to see this movie sadly. But please, I recommend you stay away from him. Not worth your precious time. Cut a piece of paper, do household chores, pencil balance on your nose, or snooze! Better to do it to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
