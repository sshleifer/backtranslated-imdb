What was Franco Zeverelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this farce, or can I be comforted by the idea that someone who did not speak English as a first language completely missed the view of the classic Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I can improve the comment I've read below, so I'll rephrase: "Jane Eyre is a great book, a screenwriter must read it sometime." It is true that the two lead film was miscast unfortunately. But it is unfortunate that the actors, because the screenwriter left all of the best scenes. The dialog box that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a common sense of pleasure ... has been deleted from the script. Proposal marriage, fortune teller ... gone. The hints, half joking, and feeling sincere, come to Jane as a fairy tale from the old man in England to save Rochester in his despair ... he was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffrelli felt the need to rewrite completely the end of the novel's interactions with Gene and the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed love from one of the best written love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do you prefer yourself and browse a mini-series (1983) with Timothy Dalton.
