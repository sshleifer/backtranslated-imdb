I saw this entire movie in the 1960s and 1970s, yes it's horrible, and it could be the originator of the "Death Faces" series of the 1980s and 1990s. Considering the so called "driver education" situation these days, you should be required to present this to everyone preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death with all its guts and horror, you certainly (if you have any sensitivity at all) get a more honest perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely, what you can do for one moment of not thinking or not being in the wheel. I worked at Bell Telephone in the 1970s and 1980s and was once assigned to the safety category. I found this film in the company's library, and I showed it at the hearing, and a number of people were physically ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said "I did not know that a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, another "RED ASPHALT", is certainly a fact in its most graphic form. I'll never forget it, I wish I could find a copy when my kids were attending Driver Driver in high school!
