I saw this because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and wonderful cars to move around. I think I lied to. This film is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins outside Kip Raines, sitting outside the Porsche Car Sales Center to see if they have the right car. When they assert that it is correct, Kip gets a brick from the trunk and chokes it out the window, smashing it. He gets a Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and take off at night. They hand them over to a warehouse only for police to follow. Therefore, the entire crew disposes of all cars and goes in separate ways. Then, we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He gives a small speech to a group of children on the kart track. Then, Attlee Jackson (Will Button) faces him. Atley Memphis told his brother Kip that he was in a deep position. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis heads to a quick house and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclestone). This person threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not transfer 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Story: The first 48 hours of the film occur when Cage and Duvall look for crew planning for everything. The last 12 hours in the movie are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You may see 10 out of 50 cars while the movie is announced. Where are 40 other cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Hunt: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not impressive at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. This is impossible. The keys were turned open. The keys were severely damaged by the dog's esophagus, stomach and large intestine. Men suggest giving laxatives to dogs to help them get rid of them. This will not work. Your dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys. This came in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a car in his upright. Take laxatives, plenty of diarrhea, but no car. Same condition with dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The Cop During The Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries hard to run the car. He sees a police cruiser behind him not looking at his car at all. But, when Nicolas Cage starts to run the engine again, the police officer shakes his head to the right and sees the car and starts immediately chasing him. Stupid. So, when he heard the engine start up and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How do you know it's the right car? He sees only the back of him. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is boring. no job. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I never saw the original, but I'm planning on it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie one star out of 10. Get The Fast and Furious instead.
