I must admit that I am very impressed with this show, so you should know how disappointed I was when I saw this movie. First of all, the plot was awful, and I think it would be something more interesting, like seeing what happened to Arnold's parents, or anything more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, the maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places, This. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the plot was not too bad after all, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends did to stop this obsession. They became friends of a spy, they drove a bus (based on a video game, For the sake of God) and, worse yet, they make super-bus movements, things many people have already tried and died of, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, they are experts in a video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was very disappointed for my mom and sister even after watching this movie, because that was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I have to admit that I enjoyed "Arnold!" , It was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this film crap, I'm not sure if I'll see "Arnold!" As I used to see in the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing Nickelodeon, with this huge number of dynamite I can assure you that it will not explode a simple street, I think the whole city can explode with it, oh, please, if all your future films of cartoons The good will be, do not do more movies, you are very critical of the cartoons that were good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this was the worst way to finish this show, which is a good show turned into the nonsense of the film.
