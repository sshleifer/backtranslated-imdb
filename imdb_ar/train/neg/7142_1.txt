This is the worst film I have ever seen. I was going to expect a cheesy movie but at least with some wonderful car racing scenes. What I got nothing. The racing budget is so low that it speeds it up to make it look "fast moving." In one scene, the Mercedes SLR runs from more than 200 to 0 in about 4 seconds as soon as the circles spin. It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a real movie about cars, browse the fast and furious serial. It may be a bit cheese, but better than the 100x this film can hope to have. Better yet just watch Mischief 3000, the best movie I've ever made.
