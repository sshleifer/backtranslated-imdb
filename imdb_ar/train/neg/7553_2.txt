A tremendous achievement in the awful. It's really terrifying. <br /> <br /> First ... Nicholas Cage must have reached the finals in the category of over-passion in his acting class. He wears new hair stoppers and a face that has been lifted several times. His back dorsal nerves appear to strain and touch his back, not only with a sick accent but creating a "heroic" character that you have no interest in. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is the case with Neil Labot and the female characters. It makes the females completely biased and shoved ... pushing them back through Cage putting several punches straight into the face and calling them all "b **** es" several times as well. I enjoyed early Labot films and a few of his plays ... but this strange temptation has. <br /> <br /> I will give this film two out of 10 films based on Elaine Burstein's performance. By the time her appearance finally appears (she sold bravely through her scenes with a visible line of wig on her forehead) all hope seems to be lost. She deserves an Oscar here and now to tell her straight-faced lines and when she appears wearing a white mummy and a blue, white and gold painting thriving around The Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin has really prepared her. <br /> <br /> This film has a very wrong and gruesome face that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicolas Cage escapes a flock of bees and then falls on the hill. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage steals a bike and looks like Mrs. Gulch of the Wizard of Oz as she roams around. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs the island and spoils the doors in search of the lost girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski is pouring out of a promising acting career in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstein dances in a said mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screams "Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it?" without reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a teddy bear runs through the forest, takes off his uniform (but leaves the bear's feet) and then moves some karate to some of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> You did not even live to see the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrifying ring that looked like it was filmed yesterday in your uncle's basement. Needless to say, if you can achieve this through this movie without laughing out loud, then you deserve a medal. In fact, there was a point in the film where I stopped diving to wonder if this was probably not a detailed transmission of "hysteria" movies ... just to remind when Cage yells / yells / whispers his dialogue that he really was taking himself seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this film is destined to be a cult film again again ... just because it is very shocking.
