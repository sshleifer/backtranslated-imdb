(Aka The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> Many nude children in this movie with scenes of lesbians have been thrown. The film is supposed to be in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic to me. <br /> <br /> Gay lesbians are invited to the castle of Count Island for the weekend. They seem to lose their heads one by one because of a crazy person's escape. <br /> <br /> It is not very scary or bloody and the rooms seem to be lit with lights even though the candles are lit. Go to figure ... (So) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot serves only as an excuse for excitement and nudity. Directed by the European horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is one nap.
