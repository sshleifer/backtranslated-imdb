As a gorilla fan in general, I expected this film to be great - as for the gorillas, it was very good - and this is the only thing I can write about this flipping. The film claims that it is based on a true story, but it actually does not come close to what actually happened to "friends" - which was, in fact, the famous Gargantua, which was sold to Ringling Bruce by supposedly "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman Barely the welfare of her animals was in the interest. As far as friends are portrayed as aggressive, this was a complete fantasy and the gorillas never used such behavior. In fact, friends managed to escape from his wooden cage (not the luxurious cage room as described in the film) during the storm, to find refuge and comfort at home, which Gertrude Lintz was terrified to sell. No, friends are not released in the gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in the zoo - it has been abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of the garage for some time with only one lighting bulb for convenience and then sold to the circus - The best yet to be thrown was peanuts until Matt (historically the oldest living gorilla registered, by the way) before a show in Miami. Also note, in the film, how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzee does not advance in age. (By the way, chimpanzees are not raised with other animals, including friends, as shown in the film)
