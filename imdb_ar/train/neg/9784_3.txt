My friends and I saw the film standing on it's own title. It's nice, although it's clear in a plot and direction - you know where the movie goes in the first five minutes. My main contention with the plot is that while it remains reasonably stable, it never explains much of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, a tired mother, a tense sister ... She is a bad family, but apart from mentioning it from time to time, there is no solution. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles ... It seemed quite random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... The children were not bad actors, but the script left them too much to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a nice side-by-side film was made to get a special effect blah, lame texts and clearly conspicuous plot.
