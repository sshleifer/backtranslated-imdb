I want to clarify some things. I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai films, and I am very used to artistic cinema; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art movies have become truly art, like paints. People did it to express their inner feelings, and were not worried about whether others understood anything. They were beyond business values. Just look at some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian Wayan (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It is an opportunistic film aimed at deceiving the rulers of clowns and critics and playing many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The story is meaningless. Water shortage makes the government of encouraging the use of watermelon to moisturize. A girl in despair, stealing water from the public toilets toilet. There is also a pornographic start (neighbor) trying to produce a movie with an actress who does not seem to feel comfortable with him. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The chaos ends with a sexual (not pornographic) scene that many people feel shocked, but I think it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. Modern. Sometimes, music number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what happens in the minds of characters. These videos are really welcome because the previous scene, without dialogue or music only people who look at each other, sometimes takes 4 or 5 or even more than a minute while the movie is TOO MUCH. <br /> <br /> There are also some bits about "The difficulty of having sex without love", "The selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film (away from it) is intended to deceive juries and critics. It has some horrific scenes of counterfeit (within the limits of Taiwanese censorship) and many topics are open, but there is nothing to wrap up or go anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks got a few of the important (disputed) prices in film festivals and the film got a commercial success that was not worth it (I see the film in France and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this film. It is boring and empty; it really is fraudulent to the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not really like), intimate movies and 9 songs are much better.
