I must start by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man turns into some of the most amazing works imaginable, and detention may be my personal favorite. * Spoiler * Although there is nothing like the Dolph spoiler because the scripts are too silly to begin with: a chase scene with a disabled child holding a gun versus a man on Harley with a submachine gun, across the entrance of the school and the child wins? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for the laughs, old friend. <br /> <br /> In short: a wonderful movie laughed content. I recommend inviting some friends to this and forcing them to sit in it. kidding.
