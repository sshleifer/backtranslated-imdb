My comments on this film have been deleted twice, which I find very offensive, as I make an effort to judge this film for other people. Please be tolerant with the opinion of others. It is clear that writing in the spirit of the work of Nietzsches is incomprehensible, so not entirely commentary. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad film for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Subject: One must be very careful in producing a film about a philosopher who has not been understood by the masses until today and between peers come out of emotional discussions. One thing that philosophers agree is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about his life, which clearly includes his "ideas" is something that a person should be very careful about, or prefer not to do at all. Wisdom starts with knowing what you do not know. One may think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about a fictional character, but about the life of someone who already lived and had a great impact on the world yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about tomatoes, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, as well as about the chosen topic, tomatoes. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a film about the actual facts. Especially in such a situation and this responsibility is not borne. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed were silly accents. why? He spends what he has to be. Nietzsche and the facts he found. It does not help to put things in perspective or time! Come on, make English suitable or better. German! Even Mel Gibson got this right part ... Let his characters speak some Aramaic jargon in passion. <br /> <br /> Second, I have overstated. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not active for filming Nietzsche. Casting is bad. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, the facts are very far away. <br /> <br /> and so on. It's a waste of cellulite.
