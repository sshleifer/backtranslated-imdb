I should not even review this film, because it is not actually a horror film - and therefore not worth the attention of Dr. Chase. At least, this is not frightening in the usual sense. It's definitely a terrifying show to waste your time watching this nonsense. That's why I closed it after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, this is true; in clear terms, this film is "roring." <br /> <br /> "The Order" had a lot of flaws, and not all of them are unique.In particular, it seems to me that the main problem in genre The "religious" sub-section of the horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage in Christianity on its own terms, and it is possible to make truly creepy films, too, just ask William Peter Platti.In fact, without Orthodoxy, such films are just an eccentric The directors' perceptions (usually boring and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone has made a virtual film about, for example However, not only did the fundamental laws of physics fail, but based on the entire scheme on its erroneous image, it will soon be drawn into the resulting senseless conspiracy. The same applies to these types of films. <br /> <br /> In other words, , The "arrangement" (and many similar films by him) invents the entire fabric of the Catholic Church and the faith and Christian attempt to construct a piece of these inventions, which is not surprising, the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has the added charm of being interesting to watch your growing fingernails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steam pile.
