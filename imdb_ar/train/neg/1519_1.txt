It took only 15 minutes before self-preservation drove me out of the emptiness of the empty eye that this film caused effortlessly and made me scream again at the armed video store to carry it. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie was bad would be a bad thing. A missed opportunity to use words interspersed with letters from the upper keys on the keyboard (just to keep these comments clean). <br /> <br /> One must avoid. <br /> <br />
