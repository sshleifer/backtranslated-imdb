It was so ridiculous that I did not finish watching it until I thought someone had released his own version and dubbed it "DVD" from the movie store. This movie made me feel sick not because it was evil, but because I wasted 2 50 it !! It seems that my brother and I went to the house and made the film ourselves and we edited footage of the slaughterhouse! I am very reckless, even BTK Killer deserves more credit than it was not accurate, means that the cow's head was clearly marked from the play paste or BUMBLE GUM OMG I can not even get all the words to explain it is not watching this movie !!!!!! !
