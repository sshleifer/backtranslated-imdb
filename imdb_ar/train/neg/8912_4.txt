Dark Rising is your awesome movie / science fiction / fantasy fast. Contains a strange and unexplained outline with holes so large that you can contain an elephant. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on, but it was not really important. It was a simple demon hunter coming back from hell to save the camp story with confusing things added around the magicians and the evil book. Draw the meaningless elements or characters. reason. The acting is bad but frankly there is not much they can do with this scenario that I guessed. There are naked couple scenes which may be the only reason why this bad movie is made (like so many other bad movies). Give this pass unless there is something else on T.V.
