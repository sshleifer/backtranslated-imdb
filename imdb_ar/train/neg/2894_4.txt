I admit that the problem I face with Ealing films that I have celebrated so much and which I have seen so far can be a problem for me. As my taste, either be ridiculously black and funny, or too light in tone to be unsatisfactory as comedies or stories. This is an important way to say that I wanted to admire "The Man in The White Suit" but I found it hard to sit down during the short run time. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness), a textile worker, may be a depositary, but he is strongly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent fabric yarns that can not be broken or destroyed. Using the factory lab for his latest experience, he is strewn with physical and human constraints - the latter are the mill bosses who do not understand what it is, then discover it and become more committed to stopping it. "Sydney complains of little minds like your brains standing in the way of progress," and in the mirror he struggles to tell the man. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with the "man in the white suit" is that Sydney's vision of progress is very small, rather than seeing the bosses or workers who dislike him. "My problem is more racist: for comedy, White "is not funny, it's a fairly difficult text and often tries to try his weak attempts at humor from the slow, double, double and dizzy shots. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine. -Blop-Bleep-Bop "to infinity, bringing a strange appearance from each visitor until Sidney extracts a miracle from him or blows him up, trying, like everything else of reckless humor that works with All good in this film, it tends for a very long time. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the Guinness Book ever less influential in the film, although it seems impossible and serious (although actually in its mid-30s) "It seems that he is not bloodier, but more brilliant than he was in" Dr. Zivago ", the same cold fish, ignoring the sad effects of the infected girl who gives her life savings when he loses his job (Vida Hope as Bertha) or the most exciting magic of sedition From young Daphne Burnley (Joan Greenwood), his real ally in his battle against "resentment and dirt," as she put it, Matt looked as sensationally exciting as only Greenwood was able to. <br /> <br /> Supporters make the "white suit" work as it does. Ernst Thesinger plays the fame of the "Frankenstein Bride" as the unique industry captain who resembles Nosferatu and laughs like a rattle. Howard Marion Crawford as another factory leader is not forgotten here because he was playing a weak medical officer at Lawrence of Arabia. Then there's Mandi Miller's undeniable charm as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera from under anyone else. <br /> <br /> But most scenes are played so straight that one does not think the director Alexander had previously worked on a comedy by the previous comedy "Whiskey Gallor" does not reflect this impression, unfortunately) . Roger McDougall's play assumes the idea of ​​scientific progress as a potential disaster, but fails to make Sydney boring in anything other than bright lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing comic films are remembered to capture the human side of comedy. However, the Ealings that I have seen do not seem to do so, since they only work when they play strongly against our sympathy. "Kind Hearts and Spellers" and "maids" (Mackindrick again, go to figure) classics this way. The "white suit", on the other hand, is a meaningless eyelash that collapses when it must be cohesive, just like that unfortunate suit.
