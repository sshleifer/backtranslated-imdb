This movie is very bad, made me want to vomit. Bad production, free zone full laugh. Why in the name of God, are you a parody of a film is somewhat a parody (and funny damn it) as it is? The groups are laughable, and the effects are so bad that they are not so funny and act comical. It's a complete mystery of why you even consider watching this part of the trash. The National Lampoon has made the house of animals, which people still consider a joy altogether. Now they have been converted into TV movies such as ****. Name an obscene word that can be used to describe this movie.
