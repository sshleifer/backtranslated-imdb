There is nothing unique in the television series nor the film. An introduction to a television program, there is nowhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynchs disgusting style of story-telling, and beyond. <br /> <br /> From the moment of the body of a poor poor girl washed on the beach. And because you know some of the most amazing mental personalities unfamiliar in the double peaks. <br /> <br /> To the almost astounding mind of sexual abuse of children in a disgusting way it seems that the film tells an emotional story about the destruction of human life through some random drug phenomena in Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I watched everything just to make sure I did not miss anything. I did not. He is simply an outspoken sexual fetishist on a long series filmed by an extravagant pornographic film. Save yourself from doom and watch anything else at least has the ability to narrate a story, instead entice you in a rational pornographic film. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of reviews, rants and rave about how great David Lynch is. Because of its ability to identify misery and tragedy and make it a kind of wonderful things. This is not a tradition of art, as much as it is a version of twisted art patients do their best to inspire a whole life indifferent. <br /> <br /> Take care of yourself and avoid this garbage.
