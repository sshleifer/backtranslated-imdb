From the critical praise, I was expecting more from this film than Tamara Jenkins. The story has completely stumbled and did not seem to have a point or plot. I find it hard to believe that the 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be candid about getting her virginity "over". I may be too young to be able to communicate (I was four years old in 1976), but I did not have any problem communicating with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful and I was not alive for any of those settings. The cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not entice them to engage the audience. In general, the slums passed through their moments, but unless they were eager to dispense with halter tops and tube socks, I would say this step.
