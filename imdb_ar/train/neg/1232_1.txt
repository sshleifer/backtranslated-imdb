She says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and wrote this film. No wonder she does not have other credits for her name for writing or output. I have made a serious professional mistake in choosing this profession. This is one of the worst human creatures in this millennium. <br /> <br /> The main thing wrong with this film, unlike his silly story about a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant lack of logic. <br /> <br /> After leaving the mall, they are contacted by four thugs who surround her. Tell me, what is the woman who will aggressively attack a potential victim during her encirclement and verbal abuse? I do not mean after the attack actually started, because of course it is quite natural that someone should respond. But she pushed that man and escalated considerably to the next level. No woman will do that unless she has 1) a weapon, 2) have the confidence to know that the backup is very close, which is relatively safe from harm, or 3) that the young and vulnerable attackers are looking for their certainty they can take them. None of this was applied in this case, so she acted like someone who asked for his rape or theft. By the way, when the security guard approached, soon when he was within walking distance of Kim Basinger, why did not he immediately run towards him for help, or scream? <br /> <br /> ** When driving after a security guard was shot in the head, driving to an abandoned part of the city, she crashed. She had a good three-minute lead on the stalkers. Instead of just jogging around the country behind the houses and climbing and continuing the fences, she got out of the red toolbox and started fiddling under the bonnet. She realized she was trying to fix her car, but she should have run. <br /> <br /> (I did not mean this to be a chronological summary of the film, because I hate the people who do it in their comments, but it just happens that every major series of this film has something so starkly stupid that I have to comment on it) . <br /> <br /> Why was she carrying a red toolbox loud as she was trying to sneak away in the dark? When caught, a clown asks her to open the toolbox. First resist, then open in the end. It takes a wrench. This scene here is very rich in subtle colors of the total failure of the dramatic effect that I have to break it, it is one of the dumbest scenes in the entire film. When asked to open the box, initially resisted as if it was her plan to get in one way or another on one of the thugs to open her anger after you did not open, in the same way that someone might in the action film possessed some of the devices claimed by the enemy that person to touch / Pressing / opening / manipulating, once this hero refuses to open it, the enemy holds on to this device, just to have this machine automatically unload a chemical / fire it in the face / introduce it to the unconscious, which was the hero's plan all the time. This seems to be what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, because they open up the toolbox dramatically and come out quickly deceptive and send one of the thugs, and get to know him one way or another of the other three thugs. Throughout the rest of the film, what you see most is the wife of this suburban house, sneaking around the forest while carrying her own red toolbox, and getting out the various tools used as weapons for Kill HER ATTACKERS. <br /> When she was running away, how did she end up going to the whereabouts of the thugs? I think it was the scene where this radio was working loudly on the memory of the deceased. I sneaked in on her in some way when she thought she was moving away from her. <br /> <br /> Finally, this hypothesis is all too weak because the whole reason for chasing it in the first place is that it was a thief from its perspective, a witness to a murder they had committed against the security officer earlier, so they felt that they should killed her. How silly. As one of the thugs said, they could have left the town and returned to any city they had left, and no one else had seen it anyway, and perhaps did not get the license plate. Even if these possibilities do not work in their favor, how do you lift the hell and track someone to kill him, which improves your chances of getting rid of the original murder?
