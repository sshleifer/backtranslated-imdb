For some strange reason, the world of cinema is driven by fashion. Someone makes a film about a deadly shark, and suddenly the ocean of the movie world is flooded with giant squid and killer octopus and sea monsters of all kinds. A man hunts by a former lover of hell, then chases every character film by a policeman from the hell or a companion of the hell or a babysitter of the hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company produces a large set of Hurricane-torn Hurricane FX programs, other film producers jump on the cart, the fact that they do not have the budget to pull them does not stop them. Night lovers are an example. What surprised me about this film is the fact that it is trying to hide its budget by cutting off advertising. Every time a cyclone appears, Camara clings to the horrible expression of actors shouting, "Dear, go to this road" and "Run for your life." Then the screen goes black to save producers the need to follow up the budget for special effects. Unfortunately, the 20-night budget should have been increased to include better representatives. The cast is not bad in any way but is ineffective and lacks the skill necessary to carry the character-driven film. Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need it? <br /> <br /> The last word about this is TWISTER cloning ..... Yes, it was not released two months ago from TWISTER, but TWISTER has been growing for several months as the summer turnout for 1996 and NOTT has a sense of urgency so Prompted me to believe that he had been made and released to link him to the buzz around TWISTER
