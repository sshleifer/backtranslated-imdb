This is not really an appropriate review because I have not seen most of the film. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, with bad drug dealers and street bulls, but that's not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> The problem here was: I've seen enough to get to know many of the characters, all of which were not interesting. Everyone was mentally unstable, had no attractive characters, and did not give me anything to look forward to. I did not find myself less curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there is one person interested, I do not mean a good person or a nice person, I mean an interesting person, and you have stayed there. See the "state of grace" to see what I mean. In this film, Gary Oldman is a complete crazy figure, but very exciting. Al Pacino may have done a good job at Scarface, but his personality did not concern me.
