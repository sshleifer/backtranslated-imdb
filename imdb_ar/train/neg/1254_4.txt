I have seen and admired the original film, and I expect more of a remake of this. <br /> <br /> Good: effects and combinations are good. There were no complaints about the result and the pictures, they were adequate, the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other managers were fine, and a handful of Supporting Supporting Entenders were very good with very limited roles). The scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: Escape from Monkey City was bad. The characters spin in circles, then suddenly somewhere in the city center there are tunnels to escape. In addition, what escape path that leads through everyone's bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to include as much work as possible. I liked the scenes of the movement, but the original film had more meat and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was not quite as logical as it was presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
