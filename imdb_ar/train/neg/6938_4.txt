In this film, Amitabh Bachchan lies in the old love of a younger woman, again. Meet her at his restaurant. The younger woman, Thabo, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks. Her reaction to his call is somewhat strange. It was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> This bothers me about this whole movie. That was not funny. The jokes and the script was terrible! The only jokes I liked were about the teeth of a waiter, but after several times, even this began to bear. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girlfriend called Sexy. This was a strange relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was scary! I know someone can be linked to a child, but this guy has conversations with that child. It had no meaning. <br /> <br /> The father of Tabu is Parish Rawal. He has to give Amitab a tough time, but we all know Parish, he can not do that. So even conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, it was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I just love the really ridiculous movies. I assume I will not watch this movie again.
