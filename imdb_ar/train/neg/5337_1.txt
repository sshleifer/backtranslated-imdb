There are so many negative reviews about "Stay Away, Joe" here, I can not stay quiet for longer and let this injustice happen. Here's a side you have not heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley movies are a pleasure to plead for a simple reason: they are perfect films for total relaxation because I do not have to think when I watch them. This means that I do not have to worry about losing a complex piece of land because there is never a plan to start it. I can just release my shoes, grab the beer, sit down, close my brains and enjoy all the public grief and rocky stunts easily from the most magnificent nodes of them all. <br /> <br /> In my books "Stay Away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "Too bad it's good." Now if you are like me and appreciate the "garbage value", this is the camp's extreme experience of the 1960s. It's so bad that it's almost surreal to see it and only when you think it can not get worse does it surprise you in the most imaginable way. In the end, you are very surprised at all the new levels of stupidity you do not know if you are laughing or crying. In short: I love her because she is so entertaining that he was there by a generation making such films. I still give it 1 out of 10 - once you reach the 100 lowest songs, it will become a classic bad movie.
