amazing. That's what you say if you sit in this movie. Simply, incredibly, amazing. It's really amazing to have someone stupid enough to dump money into making this monster so you can not believe what you see. This, my friends, is a really scary thing about this film. Someone thought it was a good idea to make it. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazingly amazing story: a high school student (who sometimes looked like a college ????) has a prostitute for my mother, lives in a trailer garden, an "artist" ridiculed for being Different ". Well, of course, this poor poor boy was killed in the end, and here's the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (under him, killed by the late John Mama prostitute). Then go around with killing all the people who have insulted him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here are the details: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Incredibly funny movie? Even if this is not what the well-known filmmakers wanted. <br /> <br /> - This one-disc supplement in the Wal-Mart container is $ 5.00, so it's a bit overpriced. <br /> <br /> It did not hurt her, she did not help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and a kind of sub-criteria - one person was stabbed with a white atom. <br /> <br /> - It seems As if they were making some effort in music, but it did not really fit the film? <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible and terrible. <br /> <br /> - The spoiler failed to leave him with sexy women When it stops being an essential element of small pieces with low eyebrows? <br /> <br /> - A ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - Scarecrow vomits unilaterally Freddie Krueger and Arnold Schwarzenegger would make red cheeks. <br /> <br /> - The basic love story does not reach any A place, and poorly done. <br /> <br /> - Some of the dead appear to have been randomly selected - you do not really know who is the one and then kill, and you assume only that it must have happened. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The average fare is very slanted, only with a scarecrow killed instead of? Well, all that nonsense. <br /> <br /> - Is there nowhere near Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhis, Benhead or Chuckie or even Angela from the Sleepway Camp series? All are better than this brutal act. <br /> <br /> - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script is loaded with a level of underdevelopment that I never imagined. Am I serious here ?? It is a complete step beyond the terrible. Do not get me wrong, it's as funny as hell, but I've never heard more of the ostentation. Even in "the massacre of the sleeping party." This film makes "Jason X" like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes Scarecrow: The worst wig ever. Interview for matching. <br /> <br /> An unforgettable scene: <br /> <br /> In which young elementary school boys broadcast their intelligent dialogue: "Hey, let's go find small animals for torture. <br /> Representation: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinema: 1/10 Personal Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexual Activity: 1/10 (No nudity) (0/10) Very ridiculous, stark, over-the-top, painful, funny, very bad, it's good, my first assessment For dialogue in any film!) Music: 5/10 Output: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br> /> In general: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another one for people like me who enjoy watching pure crap. Or integrated film slicer. This is not a good film at all. Dialogue and funny characters prevent him from being really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
