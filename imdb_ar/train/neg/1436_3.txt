Oh my God. Some of the best talent in British television made this series, so I can only assume that they were working under incredible pressure and had to settle for the first time in many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some scary scenes in this high puzzle (mostly when the "monster" is attacked and seen from his point of view), but I'm afraid to find the most funny story! Like the moment the hero discovers a broken body in a golf course: Oh, there's a hand ... Oh, there's another hand out there ... well, that's a bit puzzling ... <br /> For many years, Fans of British TV cults campaign to issue this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
