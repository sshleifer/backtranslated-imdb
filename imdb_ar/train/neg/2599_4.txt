I got a very cheap DVD and I set Drewbie complete, and maybe this is the only constellation that could interest this movie at all. <br /> <br /> The movie Drew is early, looks great, and the movie gets a lot of nice scenes for her, such as a shower scene, sexy dance scene, a lot of erotic costumes, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know from her most recent films. <br /> <br /> The film itself is average or semi-average, and it seems much more that it is made for television than film. There is no real horror or tension, and dialogues are often cheesy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most exciting part is the end because I honestly do not understand it. But perhaps there is nothing to understand anyway. But at least you will not get the end you expect, as it comes much sooner than you expected. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
