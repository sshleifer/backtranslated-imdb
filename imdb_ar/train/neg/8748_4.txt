It was interesting to know how accurate the writing on the buzz words is obsessed, but very naive in the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice was taking on more great Giants if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is more intelligent and interesting, but everything is evil. I seriously doubt that any Corp will kill someone directly; even the Ministry of Defense is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, toxins, etc. This film must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted to take advantage of Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
