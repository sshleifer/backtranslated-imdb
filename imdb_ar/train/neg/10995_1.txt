Perhaps anyone who watched Comedy Central at midnight in the last few years has seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie in 2001. It sounded like it might be funny, but I was not about to call the number on the TV and ask for it without watching the movie first. I thought I would wait until the movie was available to rent in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> After about a year and a half, I was in Tower Records and in DVDS for less than $ 20, there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99 I decided to buy it. I got home, put the disc in the DVD player, and waited for the laugh to start ... and I waited for some of that. The laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I had to agree with almost every comment on this page when I say that this movie was terrible. Patient, hopeless taste, poor writing and direction, underground film is an awful piece of trash, and in my opinion is the worst film of all time. No stars.
