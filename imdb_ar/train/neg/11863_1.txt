I thought these films were a disappointment I expected to be much better than they were. I'm very happy because I did not pay for seeing this film and I did not sit in a movie theater. From where to start in this film, the acting in this film was mediocre, the humor was terrible and only the overall story of this film was not distinctive. I thought this movie was supposed to be wonderful, but it was not more than a waste of time. I think the acting in this film was terrible, the actors in this film did not have chemistry, there was not. I think if we had a different actor from Kirk like Jay Barokil, it might have been better, but all the time I watched this film, it looked high and I did not feel that he was not acting in this film. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. Not all actors in this movie were names and had very little influence in this film. The humor in this film was not funny at all. There were a few viewers in this film, but nothing worth telling your friends they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time because he could not decide whether he wanted friendship or comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick to Burger King Trading. I think this film would have been better if the writers had gone to a different way out. The story of this movie like every other hot girl only OK love love story ?? Boring I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but nothing wrong. I honestly do not recommend anyone going to see this movie. I think you will have more entertainment in the dentist than this movie. So save yourself torment and just do not see it.
