Steven Segal .... How can you be part of this terrible film? I rented this movie because your movies are usually very clean. You've lost a lot of respect for you in such a terrible movie movie. Very bad taste! I feel embarrassed because I hired this movie. Steven, if you continue acting in movies like this, I think your career is over. I and my husband enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" through a few exercises and make them clean ... as well as very clean language in your movies ... but this movie is another thing. I'll think twice before I rent another film for you.
