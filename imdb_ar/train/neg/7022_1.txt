In over 70 years of watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedy films ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Myers and a few others have some very bad comedy, but that's the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It is unusual from the beginning, to the scene that was taken up during credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, whom I normally love, must pay badly for her salary. She desperately needs to re-learn her craft. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is) needs a better way out, to explain how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not at the level of her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find another character. He has done this kind of thing too many times. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who started years ago as a first-rate actor, is not as good as before. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent I can say in this attempt in a comedy film. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (of 4) 25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
