This film was filmed badly, bad behavior and bad writing. <br /> <br /> John Hider is very troublesome and can not escape the same Napoleonic Dynamite routine. Mania of self and ignorance. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Diane Keaton plays the same mother as the obsessed, overly obsessed mother, who cares a lot but is barely enough for the lives of her children (see I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Fares, although I love her generally, plays the role of an idiot in this film too. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is acceptable but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please, skip this movie if you want to preserve your spirit.
