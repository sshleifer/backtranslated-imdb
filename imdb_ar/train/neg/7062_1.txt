Well, maybe not, honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This was not logical at all, there was no conspiracy, no characterization, no representation, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I first saw it on May 28, 2003 ** Warning, this is a spoofing alert. He also complains too much about the bad film appearance: <br /> <br /> Well until the movie starts and the characters are displayed, but there is no explanation for the characters. As far as I knew that the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. He also seems to have lived on his own ... then he was a child, and then his mother was addicted to alcohol and still living with him. It seems that all his friends do not have parents and live on their own. <br /> <br /> Now we have reached a major plot point, this insane man has come out of a crazy refuge and is distracted. Now our main character is obsessed with this man and focuses on him with interest for the film's emergency. I think I should have missed a major plot element here, there was no reason for major personal addiction. Even if this is the point, for no reason, why do all his friends, who are skeptical about it 5 minutes ago, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie continues, and continues well. They are creating chaos in school, blah blah. But wait a moment ... Suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the "show" here. Wait a second, did not you tell the main personal crazy person specifically not to do so? It was supposed to be anything unusual. <br /> <br /> Ah Another important conspiracy element has been skipped ... The crazy person was supposed to be crazy ... Everyone said he was not crazy. But as the story goes on, it is very clear of his mind. But I thought people said it was not ... they are ... <br /> <br /> Now the film is close. Was this the end? What the hell was that? The end was not limited to answering any questions about the main character, but she did not answer any questions about the crazy person. Are these people in the same position? If yes, there are some basic lines of story that do not tend to. If the answer is no, then what is the point of saying, "This is you in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * End of thing ... <br /> <br /> That's what I thought then. This is pretty much still I think now. Six months later, if I could get it for free, I gave her another chance, but I doubt it. I highly doubt.
