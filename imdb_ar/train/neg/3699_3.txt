<br /> <br /> One would expect that the film with a famous comedian in the leading role, is a funny film. This is not the case now. I laughed loudly once throughout the entire film, and it was not even during the last comedy scene (which one would also expect to be more entertaining) This is one you can watch when it comes to television and does not spend any other money on renting it.
