Warning: Galore Spoilers! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who is remake of this unique film, is as reasonable as psycho-oh, that's true, some of the gods have already done this - calm my case. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a crimson error in simulation, proving it is not smart from the start. Marky Mark appears dead without showing his distinctive panties, then rejected by a normal woman who prefers a chimpanzee touch. <br /> <br /> The perfect incorporation shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, from inside the ship's hustle with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we travel 1300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team issues decrees. <br /> <br /> Markey's chimpanzees are lost in that key sequence of 1960s cinema - Time Warp. Markey then illustrates the unspeakable security insecurity of the space station by stealing a pod unnoticed, and at the same time shows his extreme stupidity in stepping up a deep-space salvage mission into a worm hole to conduct a chimpanzee consumer test with a $ 1 million vehicle with limited supplies Fuel and oxygen. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say a meaningless "new edition," Marky browses the hole of the worm, crashes on a foreign planet, and removes his helmet without any thought in the atmospheric crater. He is chased through an acoustic theater that looks like A rainforest, if not for the back lights of plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! APES is chasing - or at least it will be a surprise if no one has seen Planet Of The Apes for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Since Marky Mark was unable to show his profile, dropping his panties, or busting his lame whiteboy rap, was without character. Michael Clark Duncan's teeth, which were introduced in a very twisted way, helped prove his lack of personality. Helena Bonham Carter (also known as the annoying chimpanzee activist), puzzled without the text of Shakespeare, did a good job of beating both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamati, a slave trader in Orangetown, has secured the role of symbolic and symbolic relief among different species. Although I became nervous about the pictorial hearing of this film, the title of the first review has captured the essence of this "Planet of the Apes" that is "re-imagining": "The Apes of Ruth". While everyone ridiculed their appearance as additions from a million years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, like a chimpanzee, chews huge amounts of landscape and collides beautifully with kakka. With the same pleasure as his portrayal of the mentally minded mind, his character lacked the behavioral bow: an angry thorn when we first met him ... He is at the same level of madness at the end of the film. Nice twist. <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) showed a leading figure, Charles Heston Taylor, who was so depressing of the human race that he left the earth to space without any remorse - and as the film progressed, Taylor inadvertently found himself engaged Battle to prove the value of the human race - as his sole hero! The original film was ultimately an insult and not a salvation story: when Taylor discovered the Statue of Liberty, he had to realize that his race had not triumphed. Is there anything cerebral or ironic about Leo Marcie Mark? Or Ruth Thadi? No, but there is a lot of jogging. <br /> <br /> Crying slogans: Retrieve the planet. But it is planet APES. In this film, humans and monkeys fell here together, human degradation into caves, allowing monkeys to gain speech and body armor; monkeys deserve to inherit the planet! Marky Mark, in real human arrogance, thinks that humans are supposed to be the predators at the top, just because they are there. "Restoring" is as ironic as the monkeys here in 2001, complaining, "A planet where men develop monkeys and then cause problems with their excessive anal and poetic. <br /> <br /> He was represented in the POTA game 1968, because he established his reputation as a seasoned man: Ben Hor, Michelangelo and Moses were a silent and thirsty animal in a strange society, stupid of the public's expectations: to what extent should the world be insane, where our man Charlton can not respect? Tight pants. <br /> <br /> Although the monkey board was constantly tarnished by Heston, it dominated the screen When Marky Mark tries to instill enthusiasm in Mongolian human beings, it is like this unpopular man in school who suddenly makes a classroom observer, who tells you to stop drawing the penis on the blackboard as you throw shoes at him. The icon of humanity, but it starts out in a bitter twist: In the original film, the monkeys are considered an oblique monkey, but for the public and the monkeys alike, they were a symbol of humanity. This paradox again. <br /> <br /> It was fitting that the man who chewed the scene into acting - Heiston - played the role of father in this scene, Thaddeus Roth. As Ruth father of the father, Charlton uttering his timeless lines, turned against humans this time, "Damn them!" Damn them all in hell! <br /> <br /> The film becomes stupid and broken to the end, while Thaddeus offers a thrilling lesson , Is descended from the top with a scarlet of Marquis, the monkeys prove their official book by bending in obedience to this conscious creature, while Marky proves his own book by blinking, "Let us know these monkeys about evolution." First, they are not monkeys, you are a monkey! Second, it was the genetic tampering and the conspiracies of the phantom plots that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution <br /> <br /> Giving up the twisted end would confuse viewers only with the belief that the role of esteemed Warren was in fact not an integral part of the conspiracy (" In spite of the fact that it was the last hope for the human race, the monkeys of the village of Marquis are taken to Plut Point Prison where they last heard him withering. "It's mad! Madness !! ...
