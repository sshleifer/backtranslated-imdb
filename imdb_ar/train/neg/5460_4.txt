Strangely, the sixth season of the Colombo series has only three episodes, and there is little evidence of quality in at least two texts, based on this trip to "man-in-the mac" and "Fade to Murder." <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is no accident that Peter S. Flemish coined both texts above (incidentally, playing the role of security guard killed here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is rarely convincing and many artists seem uninterested in materials. The story was developed somewhat weakly with some lengthy periods of tedious conversation. <br /> <br /> Colombo also appears to be overshadowed by a colleague here (like a "final greeting to the Commodore") but the value of the entertainment is minimal. To add to that, the characterization of Celeste Holm, which aims to present comedy, is rather embarrassing to laugh. <br /> <br /> The text swings to deal with family history and killers do enough to present Colombo's gift to the case, although there is no credible debate at all about the motives of its crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what turns out to be that Colombo's worst adventure produces the most extreme moment in the series. He tests a hair stylist for men and has a hair / manicure story at the same time. The next five minutes are fun - it's just a clean Colombo hair, then he can not pay the bill and then, when he makes inquiries with a jeweler, he still looks at the mirror to look at his hairstyle! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only appropriate moment of a text that seems to have been grouped together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For specialists in Colombo only.
