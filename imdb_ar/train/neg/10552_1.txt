This piece of filth is almost impossible to follow. Sound nonsense Photo quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason the characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a serious brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Put the bad film aside, the story is just a bad evil evil If you love rape, murder and self-harm, this is true alley. If simulated killing scenes are not enough, you can enjoy the footage of the people being executed. I saw almost all of this but I had to turn it off after I saw someone exploding with brains. I have never seen a film that left me feeling ashamed and dirty.
