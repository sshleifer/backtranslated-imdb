Saturday Night Live, National Lambon, and SCTV all graduates together in a sometimes funny film. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to see it now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this film is supposed to be done, look at the number of gags that have become quite real: there is a humorous video, maybe He was not smart at the time, for something called "pregnant man" that was achieved with the stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger film "New" There is a commercial parody, which may not have been clever at the time, about something featuring Sami Davis Jr. and Jackie Onassis entitled "Celebrity Wrestling "Which has become a reality now with a popular show called" Celebrity Boxing "there is a fake film clip, perhaps not as clever at the time, which John Cannon De in a film about a broken head. Watch this clip and see how similar the shots and drawing are to the Frank Hellenlutter basket basket !! Finally, there is an announcement for a late documentary late on "A Dead Dream, The Only Lefts ..." The name of the documentary ... THE HIPPIES RECENT! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
