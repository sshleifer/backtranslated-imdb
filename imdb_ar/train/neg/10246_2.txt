"End of the World" is a quiet movie, which is strange because it is supposed to be about the complete destruction of the Earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I'm not quite sure of what kind. He has two posts in a government facility (?) Guarded by four security men. His first function is to monitor the transmission to and from space (although this actually seems like a hobby he does when he does not work in position 2). Job # 2 requires him to wear a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least this is the best I can know. It is clear that "plant" is not very secret, as the world brings his wife there. She walks around (on her way to dinner) while discovering a message from space: the main disturbance of the earth, repeated over and over again. Says something about it being the first message from space he was able to decipher; his wife told him they would be late for dinner. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). Moments later he discovered that China had suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... anywhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is there, but that does not help much. In addition, Lee performs poorly as he does in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it contains enough stupid elements that you might want to be exposed to once if you love Christopher Lee or Sci-Fi. In addition, there are a lot of earth footage that is destroyed.
