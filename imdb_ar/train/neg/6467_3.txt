I still can not believe this film. They have a lot of incredible things in them, so it's hard to believe that anyone wants to do them. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense that it is funny, but more like any story at all. How do you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a movie in prison, city intrigues, sexual jokes and a FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> Next to the terrifying actors, the most striking are the actors. I watched this movie and thought: Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (After 5 minutes) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is right. (After 5 minutes) this can not be Donald Sutherland. (After 5 minutes) No, not Mira Sorfino. This movie is very bad for all of them. (in the end). No, no, no, this can not be Martin Shen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it ended and my nerves fell. Many good Oscar-winning actors, and usually convince actors in such a stupid, stupid, horrific film. I rarely wanted to know how much they came to work in this one. They could not get much money. <br /> <br /> Just an unbelievably silly fucking movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (+1 - 6)
