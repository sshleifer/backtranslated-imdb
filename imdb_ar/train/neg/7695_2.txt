I was very hopeful to see a classic story like Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed in the film that did not keep my attention from the start, although I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> Karadin's reward in this film was a reward, but it did not live to the extent that the actors lacked similarity. For something quite similar to Zoro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras it is much better to work, comical moments and enjoy in general. <br /> <br /> Well, so Son of the Dragon has many potential fans out there, but if you're looking for something great for the martial arts and plot line you will not get. If you just want the kids to settle on a Sunday afternoon, this might be right for you with 3 ninja.
