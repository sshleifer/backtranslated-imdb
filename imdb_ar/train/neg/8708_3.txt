Like all Carnosor films, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, remember me when my sister plays with her blood, because she can not be more solid or more a fake look than she was. I mean, first they are in a bus, then in a warehouse, suddenly, they are on a boat. And let's be serious, is it conceivable that two dinosaurs can stay together in a car, or on a ship? I thought the dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can put them in a moving car. It seems stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this number 3 is that it's still amusing. I found it better than I (I have not seen the second yet). Just do not hire it. I saw him on TV which is a good thing I did because I did not want to waste money in renting it.
