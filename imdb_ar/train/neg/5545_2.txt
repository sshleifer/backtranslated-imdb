The "zombie revolution" proves that the existence of the director himself renews and recycles the idea that does not make a lightning strike twice necessarily. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, who are responsible for the classic horror movie "White Zombie," made this piece of trash a few years later to take advantage of its popularity and even recycling close-ups of Lugosi's eyes from this previous film. There was a legal battle with the rights holders of "White Zombie" who did not want Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. This word was the only thing that could help this film, because as everyone knows, bad movies can earn a lot of money once the word "Zombie" appears in the title. Knowing Victor Halpern's ability just a few years ago to make this disinterested film even more insulting. It seems that he did not release another horror film after this disaster. The zombies here seem not to be real dead, but they are simply hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create an army of mind-controlled zombies? Be prepared to crack some eggs, including your eggs. <br /> <br /> The Gimp Plot: The man falls in love with a planned woman who plays with her heart and does not deal with him except to form his girlfriend, whom she loves to be jealous. This sends the man into a whirlwind of madness that tries to use zombie mind control techniques to change things in his favor in an effort to win a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most obvious clear plot developments I have ever seen. You must be blind or stupid so you do not see the end coming. Acting is not good. This film makes the "zombie king" insensitive to racism (which appeared on the same DVD I bought) looks like a terrifying masterpiece in the atmosphere by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic film. It makes a science fiction zombie cheese festival in the atomic age "Invisible Invaders" sounds like a serious drama. This is a big ball of Melodra cheese that is ironic, which may make many fan fans of Korean film (South Korean films are often known for using melodrama). The company credits the favorite named "Favorite Movies". I'm not sure of his favorite film, but it's obviously stupid. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for lovers: zombie, romantic, or classic movies.
