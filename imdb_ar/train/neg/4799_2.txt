I personally am a fan of the low-budget horror films of the 1980s. This is not the worst but still not spectacular. The plot line is decent but it goes on a lot. You are halfway through the movie even before you see any zombie action. Murder is not very creative and it is not assumed that the zombies are supernatural. I really think that this film would have been better if they had left the zombie and made it just the same mafia. It's a wonderful sight but I feel that this film stole at least one hour of my life. I will give the film credit for being fairly original. If you are really in the horror films B, they are worth watching but if you are not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my words for it.
