... Let me guess the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. "New Edition" of title only pulls all cliches in the code booklet. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Completely weak execution of all thrill or excitement attempts. <br /> <br /> 4. The PG-13 rating does not guarantee any harm, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. Wicked is not scary or mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A group of characters written and photographed so subtly that we were not able to pay attention to them. <br /> <br /> 7. Not having any creepy atmosphere effectively (unlike the original night concert). <br /> <br /> 8. A scenario for dialogue that goes beyond the bad position - it is disturbing. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard presentations (I'm not sure to blame the actors or script above for that). <br /> <br /> 10. A completely incompetent imitation copy aimed at teenagers, which is not brave enough to try to get a fantasy - or even show a bloody pool. <br /> <br /> They are horror lovers who do not want to think, and save your money. <br /> <br /> BOMB from ****
