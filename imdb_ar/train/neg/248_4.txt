When will the harm stop? I never want to see another version of Carol Christmas again. They continue to make films with the same story, and they fall on each other in an effort to make the film better than the rest, but unfortunately they do not, because this is not a good story. Ethical, old-fashioned, conservative conservative thinking. As if people are learning. The many different versions of this film prove that we do not.
