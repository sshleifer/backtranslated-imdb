The only way for this family drama is for the parents to explain everything wrong in his message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They feed on deer for a year and then kill it because they eat their food after killing their mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for "misbehavior" by eating while not taking responsibility for using enough locks and fences or even learning to shoot rather than maiming animals twice and leaving them untouched.
