Frankly before I watched this movie, I heard that many people said that this film was a disgrace. I could not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey played roles in this film, I saw them myself. They seemed to be right. I was very disappointed and wondered all the time during the movie - why I saw this hell. <br /> <br /> Of course I did not expect much from Justin because he does not really belong to the cinema / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why they had agreed to participate in Edison. To be honest, their roles are rather stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think about whether the players are absorbing, so I should pay more attention to the story. It's really the main story of the film, but the guys ... trust me ... this is not a film you want to give credit to. Imagine this, a clever journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the regime and at the same time learned how to become a real journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by one client who still has sincerity for justice (LL Cool J) and a great investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they overcame the regime with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I could not keep going. Just remember that the film really hurts me. I advise you guys, do not see this! Please save money and time for other film.
