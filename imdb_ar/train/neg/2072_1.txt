I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I thought you really can not make a mistake in the concept of his former girlfriend with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... But the film was confused and useless ... <br /> <br /> It seemed that each time the writer continued to throw the trash. The writer also continued to throw a lot of humor in situations and sexual situations that only a teenager can love. <br /> <br /> It seems very easy to draw a story from the hero of Fatal Attraction Super .. But I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun gay comedy. You can not take a child to see him and you will be embarrassed to see him as an appointment. <br /> <br /> If a writer can make a basic story about the high concept and clean it up - the film might have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> b
