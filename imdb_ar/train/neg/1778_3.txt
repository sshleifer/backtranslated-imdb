I do not have anything against the fast-paced flick, but this Stephen King twist is very mature, very bright and modern. The plot, which revolves around a new teenager boy in a small town that is considered "asleep" - a kind of intersection between a vampire and a vampire - who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for mysterious and mysterious treatment. This excitement is given an inappropriate appearance and touch, with no atmosphere. The children are beautiful and vividly expected, but the big addition is Alice Kridge as the mother of the boy; Kridge, from Ghost Story, never broke out of the female mold, a big loss that was not used anymore. Its performance is creepy and intense, and gives a hint that "Sleepwalkers" may have been a much better film with a different focus and a tougher direction. It is too much and moves commercially, with an uneven dialect oscillating violently from excitement to comedy to drama. Stephen King appeared in a veil, as did the real life director John Landis and Toby Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
