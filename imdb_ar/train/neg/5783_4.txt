Ah, sex film and injustice. It's very bad that they do not do this anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turn out to be like this, that's not bad. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of beautiful vampires who take "johns" along a country road, take them to their castle, have sex with them, and then take them (except for the first victim, who keep it for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes very curious about this mysterious woman you are still watching. Become a real ugly here. In the end, the patches are so hot they eat everything on the horizon and can allow the captive victim to escape. Oops, much on this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that vampires do not mind taking off their clothes and manipulating each other is the only thing this movie is going to do. Otherwise, it is a confusing bloody mess (why is their grave away from their castle?), Which can only be seen in a few minutes of playing time in the vampire. The only thing that came out of this film is two important advices: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and the prostitutes do not pick up on a country road; they may be vampires. Other than that, it was really not worth my time.
