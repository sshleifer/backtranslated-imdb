I remember when this came out many children were looking at it. I think I was so old that I was not enthusiastic and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and I always found this cowardly. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, we were immersed in such programs that made children feel like they could fight and be a strong or equal guardian of these children in 3 ninja. In the end, I think both parents and filmmakers got fed up with it because all we actually had was a bunch of kids punching and hitting everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's movies have some important points they are trying to achieve and it's nice to see your children get the message and get it. This message does not contain any message at all ... It uses a million different things in less than 90 minutes . <br /> <br /> The movie contains no great visual qualities but does one expect that? The representation is very bad. Victor Wong is a wonderful actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here .. The old fart is short and rugged and rugged like a powerful ninja that was only hilarious. The kids behaved too much, and maybe the youngest Ninja Tom Tom was the worst child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a plot known to anyone before reading it for review. 3 Ninja ... Yeah you know they will fight a bunch of bad guys and win clear ... Need I say more. Sorry if you spoiled it for anyone. <br /> <br /> However, KIDS will love it. This film targets children and only children can enjoy it. If you do not mind seeing your son movies about children fighting, this is a good film to let them see it. If you do not mind allowing your children to see the complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, acting or reality, I've found a movie for your kids ... I tell kids because I think even the girls like me ... I remember all the girls who were exposed To crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it fun for adults .. This movie has spent a lot of time in it .. It is far from the cheese and nothing authentic or unique I will not allow a child to watch it ... Kung Fu The TV series is on DVD and there are a lot of wonderful Shaw Brothers movies. .. Why not show your children things that really entertain them and do not make them stupid along the way, and maybe even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as did the grandfather in 3 ninja ... no no no ... never kick a man between the legs. .. never .. this unninja like.
