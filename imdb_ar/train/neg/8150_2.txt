If you want to get a reasonably fast and entertaining hour or so, it is good to watch this. Not all that bad, really. Yes, there are a lot more idiots in logic than what I describe here and may tax the patience of people - like me, I have to admit - who tend to throw things on television sometimes, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always funny, there's no need to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> However, if you have read the book - or none of the other books written by Brookmyre - it is likely that you better avoid it. I have read them all, and when I first saw this movie, I despised it. It has been smashed in detail and in detail on another site, in fact. The TV plot does not actually carry any connection at all to the book and serves only to provoke the anger and anger of many loyal (and recognized) Prokemire fans. <br /> <br /> Best advice ..? Watch this, then read the book and just make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
