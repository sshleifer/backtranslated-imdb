Well, you've recorded this TV and missed the start. The film was about 10 seconds in titles (I suppose), so if anything happens before I miss it. <br /> <br /> Many people say Mark Hamel is in this, I did not see him. I've met Clive Barker, John Landis, and Stephen King is obviously doing some really terrifying works as a graveyard actress. <br /> <br /> Alice Craig looks pretty apart from the scenes that have a cat's face or in a totally odd-up mode. <br /> <br /> Even with the opening headlines, it has not been very well explained exactly what the sleeping quarters are or where they came from. From the title sequence, I assume that they have ugly lives living through the extraction of life force from humans. I suppose they live for a long time and these two types may be the last. <br /> <br /> Add to that a very large dose of incest (yes! I thought it was too suspicious), cats are deadly and invisible and you have slipperers. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad story that has no real explanation behind the 2 main characters and many of the heroes trying to distract attention from the simple truth that it is not clear enough to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
