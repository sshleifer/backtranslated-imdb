If he wants to be accurate, he should have chosen some Fresco citizens and not a group of New Yorkers who know nothing about Succa Free (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF all my life, and people here do not talk or act like those actors did. Everything was exaggerated, and the only cat I saw from the Gulf was JT Vega Vega with his little veil as a rapper. No shock that he was the only film in which he dressed like cats here (ie his warriors shirt). I have never noticed anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers equipment. Instead, he installed them in some SF shirts or blouses made of cheese that are not sold here. HP does not have bowling alleyways, and black and Asian gangsters do not wear heads or ties with the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team. All the Chinese gangsters do not wear Yao Ming's shirt and try to sound black while shooting the hoops. Moreover, while there is now a large community of yuppie has invaded the mission, all that appeared was some white dude and declared himself "100% Bureka West Coast." This is not New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latins in the mission are very different from the one presented here, which was undoubtedly from New York. HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. An accurate shot would have shown the drama among the HP groups in its hood as well as Villmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, and so on. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better off if I had done more and had homework and a better story to work with.
