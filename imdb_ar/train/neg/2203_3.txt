Note to all mad scientists everywhere: if you turn your son into a genetically modified monster, you need to give him a scary name instead of "Paul." I do not care if the shark's head is a fearsome hammer with sharp dagger teeth and the ability to erect ambush for people in water as well as in dry areas. Give your child a better name like "Thor," "Rock," or "Tiburon." Because even if he eats me I'll probably sit and laugh, "Ha! I get a lot of this !!! Paul the monster tearing me into pieces !!!!!" This is the worst part of this movie, this shark is referred to as "Paul" around the flick. It makes what can be a decent and scary horror film seem silly. This does not mean that there are no other parts of the Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy. Suddenly, one of the girls begins a mad itch of walking in the lush forest, and only has to pour water on her feet to relieve itching, which of course allows Paul to get out of the water and kill her. The only thing that SciFI did in this film was to let Hooty live. But this small silver lining in the film is disappointing.
