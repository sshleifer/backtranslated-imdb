Valentine's Day is a terrible movie. That's what I thought: <br /> <br /> Acting: Too bad. Katharine Hegel can not act. The other was not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story is fine, but it could have been developed. This film had the potential to be a great film, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was very great. <br /> <br /> Authenticity: Not very original. Big Prescott knows Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not see Valentine's Day. It's really stupid. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
