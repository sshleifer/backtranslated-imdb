After I saw and loved the postage (yes, I really liked Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and picked up Seed because I stumbled into it at a local DVD store and was supposed to be one of his best movies movies. <br /> <br /> While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film was very promising and seemed to be the beginning of a very unusual thriller, I quickly moved from there and finally landed in one of the most glamorous public films I have seen so far, including In that huge amount of plot holes and unrealistic emotional responses and sub-level representation. It seems that Boll did his best to reach a decent plot but after a short time surrendered to her. Maybe he should stick to comedy ?! Some good things about this film are that it succeeds in creating a generally creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected, and that the soundtrack is going well with the general atmosphere, but the uneven speed of this film is associated with the absolute word The general nature of it makes the last half hour boring Very for viewing, which completely ruined my experience. There are horrific scenes very well, but they seem to exist for shock value alone. Let's not forget the camera's work, which was sometimes nauseating. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will someday learn to make a good film, because he seems to be making a decent film among many terrible films. The film from time to time. Seeds are not just one of those.
