This match was marred by potential big differences. <br /> <br /> The opening match was a waste of the death choir, but I think the only way that could have been eliminated by demolition was DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have had to work overtime. Kerry von Erick, the I-C champion, was here. This was the third ppv in a row where Perfect Jobbed. Remember that before that he never lost a game. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good and probably the best night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Niddhart had one of the most prominent features of WWF, and he attached a Hunky Tonk man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put on a new hat (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a prediction of Bret Hart's individual career, where he returned from a bilateral match and almost survived the game. He and DiBiase developed a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the goal of the game was the tedious dispute of Debias with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the Visionaries were the first team to keep all its members alive (and only second since '87 had four survivors), this match was not a squash game. This was the longest game of the night, and Jake repeated his performance '88 when he left alone against four men and dominated him. I think it could have been really upset. These days, the game was going to end in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> It was one of the shortest SS games ever and one of the most surprising. Perhaps the most disrespectful wrestler of all, Tito Santana was the inspiring wrestler at night, wearing the war paint and pinning Boris Zukhoff, Tanaka and even the warlord in the final match. It was strange to see him express this overwhelmingly, then return directly to his humble career. Sgt. The massacre also performed well, getting rid of Volkov and the bushmen, but it was no surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point in the stay match is to win Hogan and the Warrior in the end. <br /> <br /> This offer was boring and the matches were also short. The undertaker's appearance was wonderful, but Tito Santana was the reason I would remember that.
