Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that he does not benefit at all from his nickname !! In the film ENTIRE, the zombie and vampires fight each other once or twice. Moreover, we are not really sure whether the main character in the film is definitely a vampire. One might argue that they were trying to "ease it" or make it "realistic," but it ended up getting bored. More than half of this film happens in a car. The scenes that happen anywhere else are not so much to boast about. Also, there is no obvious discount, and in the end you have no idea what actually happened during the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that for the film, which represents a decline in the value of production, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and amazing (either original or music samples taken from elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I am all for independent films, but this does not seem to have been reserved for a large audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "Worse than Scarecrow's Assassin."
