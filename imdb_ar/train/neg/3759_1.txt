Hey where to start. The cinema was wonderful. When the film first began because of the scenes of the initial scene I thought I was in a good movie. Then CGI Bigfoot appeared. It looked like a caricature of the King of the Lion and born of love in King Kong. She has completely taken over the credibility of personality. Now I knew that there was no bigfoot chasing people walking around the forest for no apparent reason, but a cgi movie was filmed with cheese. Since then, the entire film has been filmed for me. They paid the money they paid in the toilet to get cgi, and they were able to spend on uniforms like Roger Patterson. It was the best outfit of the Bigfoot type at all that no one could match. I admire Bigfoot with cheesecake and I warned against this film but I was forced to watch this movie and I was disappointed like the previous reviews that warned me about it. I know that after reading this review, you will still say "I have to watch Sasquatch hunters, I must watch Sasquatch fishermen." Then you'll say why I wasted my good money I barely acquired in a very boring boring film!
