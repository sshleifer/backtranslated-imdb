First of all, I'm white, so I try to get into the sweaty subject matter at all ... anyway ... white people hate black = BAD but blacks hate white people = OK (because we apparently deserved it !!). where do I start? I wish I had a good thing to say about this film aside from unintended comedy scenes: The infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. Engage in a battle with a really big, really powerful, really angry and scary person looking for neo-Nazis and winning !!! New Nazi where double the size :), chasing! The chase is priceless ... This is not a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not offer ... it is a racist film that reaffirms all vulgar stereotypes, the white man who deals with him turning the black room automatically into the skinheads ... cmon simply Horrible I regret to see her never. <br /> <br /> Save your time and awesome experience to a badly written, misguided, boring and clearly biased image, if you're on the subject, go and rent American History X, now this movie
