I think everyone was very disappointed by this science fiction flick. For one reason, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, gross and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Everyone in Imdb says it's crap and boy, are they right! If you do not, avoid it. It is snoring. 1 out of 10.
