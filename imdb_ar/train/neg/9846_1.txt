You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most senseless films ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but there was nothing funny in this film. Even the film industry realized that this film was too weak and did not even try to promote it. It is a wonder that it was put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what type of contract caused the existence of vendors in this film I wonder also why the people responsible for this film to continue to produce other bad films. This film is certainly a waste of the money used to create it, a waste of time for anyone watching it. Certainly there are high school students who will be able to write / produce a film as a plot.
