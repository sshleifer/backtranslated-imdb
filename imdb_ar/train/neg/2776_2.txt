King Maker is a film about a series of real events (need to cite) that occurred during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although fashion and artistic direction are commendable, the film still fails to convince the viewer. Representation, in particular, was very bad. Some actors try hard to alleviate the tears and dialects, the real ones are fake, very troublesome. The story was also very stupid and so stupid that it was not real and seemed to be closer to history. The film could not even capture this kind of luxurious, century-old air that looked like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? Fashion and artistic output give the film a refreshing breath, but the execution was so bad that actors were not even able to give natural bursts of emotion. In short, the film looked more like hullabaloo than text.
