This should be one of the worst Swedish films ever produced. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad scenario allowed him to become a film and a movie show since 2006. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of the visual advertising products in one and the same movie. This should not be obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why many well-known actors thought the idea would be visible in such a film. If I have any respect for some of the actors known in this film before I see the film, it is definitely over. <br /> <br /> I heard that there will be a follow-up film to this film and I can not understand how it is possible.
