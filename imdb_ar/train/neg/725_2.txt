This movie was awful! Not for the subject, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend at that time (when the film came out), and I expect to see a film about the triumph of the human spirit over injustice. What we saw was two hours of brutal police persecution, and there was no escalation at the end. I made previews and no mention ads for this! In addition, although they played the role of Goldberg Walbie, she remembered that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, do not underestimate anything about this! (This is not what you expect, but the problem is even more.) If you know how depressed this will be, what I've never seen. Or at least, I'd be prepared for it. It was a tasteful advertising campaign and I will never see this movie again!
