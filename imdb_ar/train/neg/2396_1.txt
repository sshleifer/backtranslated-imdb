I just saw this movie on TV and had to admit, I was a bit surprised that it was even on. There was a lot of wacky, chaotic, and bad editing that was an old episode of Sesame Street that was better seen. The acting was good, but please, you can really feel the feelings "directly to the video." The crew / crew made this melodrama bad. Yes, there is a message in the film, but just wait until ten minutes before the end to hear it. Trust me, so you will not tell the difference.
