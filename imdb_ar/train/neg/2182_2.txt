I purchased this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing him, I might go back to the store and try to recover my money! The only reason I gave to Movie 2 and not 1 is that the story contains a few new story elements, although they never rise to the level of being interesting. This film has all the characteristics of being manufactured in the theater market - very low budget, amateur representation and a liberal dose of sex (for an early film of the 1960s). In fact, I wonder if perhaps the only reason behind the film's production is making a quick profit and because someone knew some strippers they could use as add-ons. The film revolves around a fake doctor who wants to plant his girlfriend's cut head in an undeniably donor body. Most potential donors are strippers or prototypes - his only real goal in the film is the tickle where they remove most of their clothes. However, they are making a lot of effort to make the film worth watching to watch movies and the film is not bad enough to be watched by bad film fans.
