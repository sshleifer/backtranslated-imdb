The Choke was released on a DVD in the United Kingdom named Ax, a teenage teenager who fails in every section to a large extent: the story is almost nonexistent, resulting in a film consisting mostly of people wandering around a dark building; They mean they do not care much when they are slaughtered; deaths are not bad enough (unless a short shot of a pound of minced meat covered with fake blood turns your stomach) ; The unwarranted sex scene appears next to any nudity (an unforgivable unforgivable mistake in the flick!). <br /> <br /> The wafer plot sees members of a punk band locked up in what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless deserted corridors and rooms, unlike any club I have ever seen) Visible. For a low budget effort, production values ​​are fine, and all representatives seem to be fairly capable, but with almost no real fear, the reluctance to mess is real (this is minimal, so where is the painting sprayed? ), A lot of terrible dialogue (especially from the drummer who did not die soon) and some bad use of attractive video techniques in an attempt to add some elegance, the film quickly becomes very boring.
