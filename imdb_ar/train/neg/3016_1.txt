Like many others, I love Tony Scott movies. When this film came out, I had great hopes of being like a "man on fire". To find out that the film is the farthest thing about it! The story was tipping water from the start, and Mickey Rork's choice was not a good idea. The whole 'arm' was very gratifying! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this film reveals that it will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst works ever. <br /> <br /> I love Tony Scott's direction, but this requires an entire friggin cake! Sorry tons, 1 out of 10!
