*** Comments contain spoilers *** You barely stuck this offer as a TV set when the disturbing music started under each scene, when it was almost an average shooting in almost every case, when it was clear that Diane Farr was pregnant (But we did not notice) and when Colby was a TRIPLE agent. But now, in the ring tonight, David is caught in a paranoid job, an amateur with a pistol, and in the elevator and ... he can not disarm. Field agent experienced trainer, who was ranked first through the door several times and has experience in manual fighting, can not get out of the job. Not when the nut's function flickers, looks distant, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when the fiber-optic cord is seen fluttering around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene that allowed me to know that as much as I enjoy learning from Charles Chubby Chubby, but very charming and interesting owner of love / love Amita, Friday nights will spend better otherwise. Don David gives the word "distress" which is the symbol "The s ** t is about to come down"; David is ready, kills the lights, drops the elevator, and surprises the nut job and ...... <br /> <br /> Can not For David CAN NOT get rid of the weapons / kill / assault the mission. The bad guy ends up with both guns, and David ends up shot. <br /> <br /> I'm finished. Hope NUMB3RS will be fun.
