This movie was disgusting. This should be a warning that some of the female writers of Sayidat are trying to make a name for themselves before being held hostage for an hour and a half to watch the garbage. What is rubbish? Misuse of peoples' time, energy misuse, and waste of any kind of education system that taught them how to read and write. Next you are a losing patient. Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger drugs for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and the plot gave me no choice but to progress quickly in the middle of the garbage. I ended up in an unwarranted scene. If you want to know how shocking people are watching Larry Clark's film. I have lost all respect to the actors in this film "no more support than me". How can actors or actresses sit on a group while these serious images of human behavior manifest themselves in a psychic mind? I feel sorry for all the actors involved in this scene. I think Satan now knows who is the author of this film; congratulations to you for his interest.
