What a long film. I am sure that this film is historically interesting, but with continued entertainment, this class is not made. Ralph Fein was in some wonderful films, "The English Patient," Schindler's List, but this film was such a race. He did not seem to be going anywhere, his character was initially very laughable and amazing, I was surprised that his "sister" was interested at all. Do not bother paying for the rental of this movie, and buy a copy of "English Patient" instead.
