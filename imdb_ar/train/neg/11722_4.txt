The problem is summarized with CONTRACTER by the opening scene. The CIA wants to kill an international terrorist, so he called the Black Operations Killer James Dial. The terrorist appears at the Old Bailey Court in London, which asks why they want to save a terrorist if he spends the rest of his life in prison. It will be out of circulation in either direction. Did not the CIA have a chance before his arrest? If, on occasion, he gets a guilty verdict, he will kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend his life in a high-security prison. <br /> <br /> Since the hypothesis sets the story, the public may choose to ignore the plot opening but the assumption itself is in the fire. A colleague was killed by a police bullet and a taxi that was driving in accidents but Dial managed to escape. Were the police close enough to shoot at someone but very far from arresting someone from a car accident? The film of this kind of collusion conspiracy. Later, Diyal found a police inspector pointing a gun at him, saying, "This airport is surrounded by armed guards," but Diyal managed to escape very easily without explanation. The whole film deceives his audience by relying on things that are not explained. This includes an important supporting character called Emily Dey. Why is Dial help though it is required to fugitive? Your guess is as good as me <br /> <br /> This is a fairly bad thriller and is not filmed by Big Name. Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a movie star but he killed his career by starring in an unprecedented film. Charles Dance also appeared in Hollywood productions with huge budgets such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but once again he was known for his direct appearance in DVD shows these days, and he plays a wonderful role anyway. The likes of Lena Headey may continue to become a big player in the cinema, but she will certainly fail to put CONTRACTER on her autobiography
