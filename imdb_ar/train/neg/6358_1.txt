How many representatives can defend his or her neural, compulsive, ubiquitous personality? In this film, Will Will plays the role of Will Ferrell, less directly impersonated by Kenneth Branagh in "The Celebrity." It is a disturbing story now: a nervous Nubian man with a wife or girlfriend madly in love with the impending queen who shows all forms of perfection. Everyone lives in perfect giant apartments in the great neighborhoods of Manhattan. All of them keep up the expensive, exclusive restaurants where all the characters are connected with wonderful tales and a vague philosophy. There is always a trip to Hamptons, where the main character of the serenity walks through the sand. Physical exertion and potential exposure to diseases, and then of course, the main character feels guilty about his lust for Queen Sheikha, but she follows them anyway, sometimes succeeds, sometimes fail, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula to prove that Allen is not a great artist at all. It seems that just a dirty old man has the sexual desire and emotions of a 20-year-old person and intends to tell boring old stories over and over again.
