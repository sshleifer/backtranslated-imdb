I love Westerners. I can see it all day. "Good, Bad, Ugly" is my favorite all the time. I watched Silverado for the eighth time probably the other day because it was shown on CMT. However, this film, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst Western I have ever seen. The representation was terrible everywhere. They do not explain anything at the end of something obscure-looking compass. The only good part I can think of is a good-looking Cantina girl. The very long pause periods between the dialog box seemed intentional just to spend time making the film an acceptable length. This film was not worth the new rent you paid at the local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserved to refund the rent if there was such a thing. The only reason I ended up is I hate not to see a movie until the end. I switched it off halfway because it was very bad. For the manager, please do a better job if you decide to create another job. This is the kind of film that has the potential to transform people into Westerners.
