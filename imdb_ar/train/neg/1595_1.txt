The film seems to appeal to me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was off track and had no interest like other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same vulgar humor and wicked bad guys. It was not useful to use the movie if you wanted to become a famous Pokemon. It's best not to associate with animations like Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are not level up to the original anime level. It is shameful to talk about this film. I bet that Pokemon lovers will be disappointed by the movie result and give up Pokemon. Digimon is more than anime and does not fall anywhere near Pokemon.It's a second film will be released in late 2002.
