My grandmother and sister took me out to see this film when it appeared in theaters in 1998, so we happily bought tickets, popcorn and soda, and we went straight to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it ended, the audience did not applaud hard, I remember hearing a few people say they did not like them at all, I did not like it, and I thought he was a bit stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical about it, but apart from it, the entire film was bad, and I rarely laughed at parts of it. I also remembered that the other people in the theater were hardly laughing. What I thought was bad was to make animals talk, because talking animals exist only in animation, and in live motion movies, they are absolutely stupid! I said that regardless of the hysterical evolution of Eddie Murphy, this film is not worth watching, it is rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in many movies and I thought it was fun. I just said that it was the only funny part of this film. I did not see Eddie Murphy in the "wonderful" movie, Pluto Nash's Adventures. This film is not really a film I recommend because, apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like this, especially because there are so many animals talking! <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a 3 star rating out of 10 possible stars.
