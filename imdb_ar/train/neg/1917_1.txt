This film, although not quite bad, should have been filmed where actual events occurred. Grand Island, Nebraska was destroyed by at least seven hurricanes on the night of June 3, 1980. The Grand Island is located in the almost flat river valley of Platte River in Hall County. The filmmakers filmed on the tree-lined hills of Ontario and took the entire event to a non-existent city called Blensworth. The people of Grand Island miraculously survived this awful night just to forget about a bad-made movie.
