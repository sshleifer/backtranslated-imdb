This film looked promising but it was very bad. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was awful. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the enthusiasm of this whole film. Jason Schwartzman was once again very troublesome - even more so than in Rushmore, the other actors were not in a state of events. It turned out that the scenes that were supposed to be fun were inappropriate and incredible events. Trying to be a trip on the road / American Pie but it fails painfully at all levels. A complete waste of everyone's time.
