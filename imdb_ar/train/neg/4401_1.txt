We went to the movie with a group because the play we were in was canceled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It's not that I do not like the movies of worship I love. But nothing happens in the film. You do not feel any contact with the characters at all. Endless times without dialogue. And the car. How can Tai carry a huge tent, beds, chairs and clothes every day in that car? It's two seats! I have to say that the scene is beautiful, but not in the film, the director had to take photographs of the film, so we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time without anything happening. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, because it is a waste of your time
