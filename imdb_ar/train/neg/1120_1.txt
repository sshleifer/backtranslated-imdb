I saw this film in my international film class and got a profit. This film is only one scene of shocking value after the next day. <br /> <br /> The fourth man revolves around an alcoholic writer named Reeve, who has visions of his pending danger. Meets a woman called Christine when she gives a lecture at the local book club and decides to stay with her when she discovers her boyfriend's attractiveness. To put it bluntly, he loves the Dutch sausage breeder. So Reeve is a plan to seduce Khalil Christine so he can have sex with him in the end. But later discovered that Christine had 3 former husbands killed by them all. Now Reef and her boyfriend Christine can be the "fourth man". A logical story with no plot holes. Editing and everything technical about this movie is quite good. The movie was just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not an artist of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Reve coming out of bed in just a shirt. So at the beginning, you'll see the nose of the beautiful countryside that walks around as he walks around his narrow apartment in a hangover. Later he has a dream where his head is cut by scissors, and they show him along with the blood fountain that followed. Reeves loves him a statue of Jesus and has gay sex in a mausoleum. In addition there is a lot of blood. Blood more than all Freddy Krueger films combined. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the "horrific" viewer, but this film is very blatant when it comes to shock. The whole film revolves around the value of the shock. <br /> <br /> So, if none of this is your tea cup, watch this movie. Otherwise, keep away from this. My mind is still scars.
