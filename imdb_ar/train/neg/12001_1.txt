My sincere advice to everyone: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not approach the theater where this movie is played !! Even a glimpse of it is bad for health. Grand. no kidding. It's 3:30 am. Promised from this film the craziest on the universe. Four hours fuck! I'm proud that I survived after all that! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated. Disturbance. Disappointed. It was just a waste of time! Money went in the drain! No plot. I hope to wake up sane tomorrow and without any memories tonight! FILM RUBBISH. <br /> <br /> Happy Republican Day to one :)
