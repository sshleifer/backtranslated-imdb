I've voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as Greenaways does all the output. Yet his usual mix of "artistic" sex and bunk foolishness. I know a lot of people like this movie but I'm tired of it very quickly. It's definitely not for everyone. It is clear that McGregor has played a clear role for credibility. I think he should not have wasted his time. I hate to deposit anyone into a false corner but please ..... !!! On the positive side, she's very visually attractive and I enjoyed the music but I could not see it to the end and I can not say that for many movies. I usually watch everything but this is unbearable !!
