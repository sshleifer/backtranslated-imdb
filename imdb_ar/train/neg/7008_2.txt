Annie Potts is the highlight of this truly boring film. Mark Hamill plays the role of a teenager who is really upset about someone stealing a Corvette that turns him and his colleagues into a starting point (perhaps the ugliest car in a movie) and heads for Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I'd be out of my sight after watching this if it was not fun to watch Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's also bad for Hamel that he did not take some acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a drab veil.
