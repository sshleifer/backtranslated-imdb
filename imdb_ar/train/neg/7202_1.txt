Because I liked the animation of the Inspector Gadget in the 1980s, I went to watch this movie. I have wasted my money. The plot was very high. Also, the film can not keep me interested for a long time. I was happy because it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Inspector tool, see the animation instead. It was much better than the movie.
