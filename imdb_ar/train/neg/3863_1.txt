Wonderful. That's as much as I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? What self-respecting actor would agree to "act" in these things? My God! I do not know how this film was made, but I assume that taking eight cups of coffee that day was the key to keeping me awake. Oh my God! It was one of the most unpredictable and ever-seen films I have ever seen ... and for the record, I never plan to 'see' it again. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie when I purchased a DVD (Error # 1). I mean ... I figured, hey! Julia Steeles. I like her. She is nice. I will see it as soon as I get home (Error # 2). I tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes. I wonder when this concert set will end, I really did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what is it that imagines what will happen and then settles in real life? This was disturbing enough when the father used to do so in "paternity" as it was ten years ago. "Jokes" - Believe me, it takes me a lot to call it - stupid, vulgar and tolerant characters, and the story is quite predictable ... and all this makes for a movie that must be erased from history records! I had to think that there was something wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this film. It was probably a direct DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who might think about seeing this, I have one advice. DO NOT! For the love of God ... no !!! I'm ashamed of getting it in my DVD set, and I can not get rid of it ... no one, I mean NOBODY wants to buy it from me! I'm talking about used and used savings stores that will buy mud from your shoes and stick to it in the store window. We should let you know just how CRAP is.
