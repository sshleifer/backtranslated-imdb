If Alien and Jurassic Park are countless scientific horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this movie. The film begins in ancient England around 1100 AD, and then moves to California. Our hero Carver (Dean Kane) is the security chief and new military adviser to the Science Lab 400 meters underground. He arrived (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the leading world and soon discovered that he was a cloning laboratory and had something newly found to reproduce. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the above films, all hell breaks down and our characters start to fall off. The special effects on Monster are very good for "Direct to Video" and Dean Cain is paid for. But forget the rest of the group as we discover why we have not seen them before. Again, do not enter into big expectations and you will be fine.
