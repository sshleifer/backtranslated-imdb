Maybe I'm out of date or do not know what Electra is in the current publications ... But the Electra I read was more manipulative and seemed to always have a plan. Others were usually used to do their dirty work and often engaged in a kind of double cross. Just when you think it's all done, pull the wool over your eyes and start out. <br /> <br /> This film was somewhat weak in the dialog box, the play was not particularly persuasive, it was sporadic. I was actually looking for something more like Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin". It is much darker than anything in this film. <br /> <br /> A special effect where great activity was sometimes wonderful, but often the story and the plot were slow or illogical. The Hand Hand was not threatened enough, Electra was not ..... confused enough. She's the girl she likes to hate ... But in this story, I did not care either way.
