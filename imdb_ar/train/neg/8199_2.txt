I'm so glad you soooo I did not spend the money to go to the cinema it :-). It is nothing more than a collection of a few elements of other classic titles such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. in a senselessly boring scenario. I can not really know what the purpose of this film is - he has nothing new at all in his senseless story as well. Moreover, there is nothing to watch - FX'es looks like it was taken from a used-goods store, which I've seen in other movies. But it certainly is good humor.
