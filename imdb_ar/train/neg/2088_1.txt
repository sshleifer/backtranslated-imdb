What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to be watching anything, regardless of quality. I was shocked that something exceptional like the Firefly lasted for one season, while the trash like the Battlestar Galactica edition was reborn. This offer is deplorable in every aspect of the show. Representation is an event that is uninspiring. Characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything in a bad science fiction series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than the peak time soap opera. The direction is lousy and the collections awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin that should never be.
