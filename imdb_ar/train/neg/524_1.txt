"The 40-year-old virgin" is in a world I do not understand. A world where an electronics shop employee can tell his boss to "stop" and broadcast videos of his naked ass all over the store and not reprimand. A world where it's really funny driving drunk and smashing other peoples cars. A world where it seems okay to harass a coach with his sexual means. A world full of stereotypical and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I was quite shocked by the chorus of viewers who loved this movie. I thought that every scene was like a Saturday Night Live sketch - it's not funny to start with it, stretching beyond all rational thinking. The waxing scene continued forever. <br /> <br /> The characters, along with Karel, were quite remarkable. The romantic elements were quite contrived, especially the scene in which Kinner finds a ghost in Karel's apartment. It was just lame. <br /> <br /> I also found the sequence of "Aquarius" quite disturbing and excessive. I hated hate I hated this film!
