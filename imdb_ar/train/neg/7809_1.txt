Certainly for the odd debut of Michael Madsen. Madsen plays the role of Cecil Moe, a man from an alcoholic family whose life collapses around him. Cecile holds a phone book and searches for the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. Goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. Cecil teaches to respect the word of God and puts Jesus in his heart. This makes everything better. Ah ... if everything in life was that easy. The fact that this "movie" looks like it was manufactured at about $ 500 certainly does not help. 10/01
