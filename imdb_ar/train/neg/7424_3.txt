Very interesting movie fare here with Stella Stevens takes directions from a disguised person (it did not take long to guess who it is) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for stealing money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her three-member girl gang and finds that they have to act much faster than expected. Despite some elegant views of Las Vegas in the 1970s, a very modest figure, but with the credibility of most of the participants, and a potential plot line, Las Vegas Liddy puts one big boring egg. It seems forever that the film begins to gear, when it is only shown here and there and there is never accelerating. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Of course, I did not expect anything great, but at least I thought this might be one of the chic exploits of the 1970s or the like. Not so close. No one dies. There is a lame gun battle between the stout Stewart Whitman and George Desinzo, a year before his great performance as a lawyer for the Buglosa trial at Hilter Skelter. The gun battle has all the suspense to see the waterfall. There is one punch and hit the head with a sharp tool. Beyond that nothing in terms of work. As for girls, do not expect too much. Stella and her girls (both very modest but with beautiful gifts, get a sauna and a bath, what do we see, nothing but a sideways image.) Stella wears these beautiful open blouses that highlight her real talents, but I wish she were more open with her performance. I write one thing that would recommend the movie: Unfortunately, it was not, and I have nothing to say for the benefit of this film, it's a terrible movie in no way, just nothing happens to it.
