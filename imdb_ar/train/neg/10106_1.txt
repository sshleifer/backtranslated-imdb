Yes, I'm sure it can really be a nation. . . If four of them stood on all four corners of the world and the other two were copied a few billion times. Man, I'm really glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I am a big fan of George Romero's films, and I'm sure that if he sees this movie, he is likely to throw a laugh hard. I mean, what about the raccoons who were wearing zombies and walking around like Charlie Devils? It is really useful for the music composer to choose the crazy fashion music when the zombie goes to their killer, especially the part they go to the warehouse, posing as a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / whatever the room is with the gong in the background. The furniture shop is closed. I could not even determine the nationality of the murderer, and the fact that his tone suggested that some of the multiple states did not help as well. Well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene without good reason in a warehouse where they seem to be shipping air boxes all over the world. So, for all those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just want to expand on C bad movies (C for Craptastic), this is the right movie for you. . . or not.
