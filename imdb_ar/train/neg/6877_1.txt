I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and ended up watching a film about the New Yorkers. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see 50% living in poverty. When I see people struggling, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans who recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... Either you speak Spanish, or you do not speak .... and from what I heard ... you do not talk. Pedro Albizo Campos is not my property. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence which is 1%. The rest was like Osama bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any guide to all Puerto Rican dreamers, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. Wonders worked for them. This documentary does not revolve around Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nueurs and their struggles. <br /> <br /> To a person who complains that there is not enough of Africa ... it was supposed to be around Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Only one dinzel will be made after a short time for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, to all those ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the United States and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puerto Rican culture. Tell your children to pay attention to geography and history. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc". It was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if we all felt it. It should have been titled ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunch ... I can not speak Spanish." Please stop using the language of Puerto Rico, Rico or Purico or anything else associated with this historic Nuri lesson. God forbid they play this on the island.
