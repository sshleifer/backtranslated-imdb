This film, which deals with the mental experiences of the clandestine government and the corrupt use of citizens by mysterious and sinister characters, could have been a truly interesting film. But for me, I have failed. I will not explain much about the confusingly confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user's comment "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But it did not work for me. I found it slow, and this would be fine but for the fact that it did not seem to go anywhere. The viewer is left in the dark about so many things that he is not really able to deal with this film - in some movies, one can argue that filmmakers intend to stir up thought and leave things ambiguous for that reason. I do not think this is the case here. <br /> <br /> As for the repeated long shots of buildings that users frequently mentioned frequently ... I think they have a point - give the viewer time to drink another drink without losing any "action". I think many viewers will welcome the opportunity to have a lot of drinks on this trip.
