The bold issue is the killing of college students, can the new teacher stop madness ?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not care. <br /> <br /> With an address like Splatter University, one can instantly realize that this movie is not just a high art. But even worse, Splatter University does not even qualify for the fun of garbage. The U Splatter was made very badly - the story is unemotional, the characters are far away, and the whole film lacks any essence of the imagination. Needless to say, there is no suspense, atmosphere or fear. This driving group is not brave enough to throw any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). So everywhere around this flawless morgue to infinity, offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and just becomes a full cavity. Bottom of the barrel - so fanatical fans will die thinking twice before watching, let alone paying money for this click. <br /> <br /> BOMB from ****
