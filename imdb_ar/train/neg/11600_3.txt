After the success of Part 4, another supplement was a natural step. Yet they had to stop it before it started. Alice, after surviving from Part 4, found herself pregnant and it seems that Freddy is using her unborn child to reach his victims, and of course Alice's friends. A strange nightmare film, too heavy on religious images and bad representation. The special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
