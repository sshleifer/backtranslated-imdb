I have tried to track this movie only through Google's bad phrases about "Teenagers seduce and kill a man at home" as well. I think I first saw parts of this movie when I was about 10 years old when I was working on cable. It made the impression completely! It's a kind of film that children know they should not watch, and change the channel when their parents come. When I saw who was the team's representative, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in this terrible film. Then again, if you want to see men who deceive their wives are being killed, this is an interesting film. Also, if I remember, there are some odd moments. Probably the dumbest end of all time, but still ... memorable.
