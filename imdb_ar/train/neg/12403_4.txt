ANDY HARDY meets DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth film (ninth) of the series and shows the direction that was inevitably heading to him. The characters ANDY HARDY (MICKY RONY) and JEWARD HARDY (Louis Stone) were in the foreground and center. The rest of the cast was walking round the clock and collecting checks. The series will rise to this occasion again and will be its moments but a fatal retreat has begun. <br /> <br /> Throughout the series, Louis Stone will continue to portray JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the staff will be professional although they are given little and no less to do. Mickey Rooney on the other hand will continue his character as if there is no educational curve. ANDY's reaction to any position was naive and unreasonable. Even after returning as an old warrior in the service of World War II in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "teapot" was the same, happened. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is clearly visible. ANDY gets himself in many incredible situations which may be solved with a simple explanation. This screen-writing device is known as the "stupid plot". A way to extend a badly written script. Maybe Mickey Runeis's mistake was less than the director and the book. Most likely George B. Seitz had directed many people and needed a stricter hand to control the excesses of Runes. For an overview of the whole group, go to YOU ​​ONLY YOUNG ONCE (1937).
