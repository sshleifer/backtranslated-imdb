The most striking of this semi-musical group in the 1920s is Berlin's magnificent cinematic and liberalism. It is in the forefront of First National in these sections. The story is somewhat appealing and resembles the plots of two other films by Miller (SUNNY, SALLY) where a working girl sympathizes with a rich boy with family denigration, complications and ultimate snatching. All four music numbers are collected at the beginning of the movie and we go for a long time without any additional musical accompaniment. Miller sings parts of I think of BABY and re-joins you. There are also never be of blue, you are not the first person. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very attractive and very enjoyable, and reminds us of Irin Don in the way and delivery. Sadly, she does not dance because that is her strength. Sally is still her best filmmaker, second in the list, while poor Sunny is ranked second. Her life was tragically interrupted by sinusitis before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It is worth visiting these films to see Ziegfeld's top star in the 1920s.
