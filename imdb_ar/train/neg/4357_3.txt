A group of friends come face-to-face with a hideous family of cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of a "transformed cannibal family" is as old as the hills the family members imagined was often related to the home, so any director who tries to breathe new spirit in this genre needs to come up with something very special to influence . With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the Teutonic routine a good tune, by transplanting the Black Forest and giving it a low-budget German treatment. The result is a very bloody effort, but it is not entirely original, made almost by some frightening decisions in guidance - in particular, the non-stop use of luxury filters and annoying editing methods. <br /> <br /> Had Timo did not choose to use any of the naf tricks given by his editing program, and then Barricade might be a reasonably entertaining festival: the inexperienced team of actors do well; the bloody effects are stomach upset . There are one or two fears and even some well-designed creepy moments. However, all of this has been completely destroyed by the camera's poor work, intermittent editing, and the massive bombing of visual tricks used to give the film a faltering look that is popular with filmmakers today. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the curious hole, which includes an elegant scene where the man is forced to drink acid, lots of bad wounds caused by a variety of sharp instruments, and some mild damage to the gun.
