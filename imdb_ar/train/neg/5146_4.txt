For a long time I was looking forward to seeing this film, here in Latinamerica Japanese or any oriental films that have no distribution in the theaters, we can find some of those films in some underground stores, Avalon found, I was expecting something good, but the only good thing in this movie Is the first scene, the rest of the film is dull and meaningless, just plain stupid, with a lot of useless scenes, boring story. I waste my time writing about this film. Sorry but the truth.
