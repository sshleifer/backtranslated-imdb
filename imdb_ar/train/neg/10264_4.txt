Jane Gill, the head of a joint family in New York, works with Mary Barton, with her younger sister Ethel Granin (like Loma Barton) at the Smarter Sweets. After Mrs. Gandin was kidnapped by traffickers in the sale and purchase of women as prostitutes, Mrs. Gail and her police friend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the young woman threatened by virtue. <br /> <br /> Traffic in the soul has a reputation that is hard to support - not well done and showing nothing unique in the presence of the "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex traders. Perhaps, it can be supported as a film dealing with the subject longer than usual (claimed it was originally 10 rollers). The sights of New York City are the main attraction, after all these years. Do not forget to immunize prisoners behind bars, because nothing else seems to be able to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> *** Traffic in the Soul (11/24/13) George Luan Tucker ~ Jane Gill, Matt Moore and Ethel Granin
