Now I have never seen a bad film at all in my years, but what the meaning of songs in the film is physiological meaning. Wow show some hidden Pokemon and they double I can get a fit of this. Animie is useless because its makers are useless. Their big marketing plan seems to be just a cut on the songs and they will get a good rating. I think this film would be fine if they put a message. You should see all the episodes of Pok√©mon to understand what is happening and not a film. It's just an animation that must be on a video. <br /> <br /> Note: I will give it 1 because I got only $ 5 and I could not give it half because there are no halves.
