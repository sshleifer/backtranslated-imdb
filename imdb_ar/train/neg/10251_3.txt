A great deal of running. Bad design discount with little complexity. The world of communications, which sends signals to space and receives them, is preoccupied with foreigners. Along with his beautiful wife, he invades their land and gives secrets about them. Becomes a traitor to some extent in the process. Granted, he was given little choice anyway. There is a scene where they give them everything they want. This is a boring film with lots of long extensions where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, trek through the jungle, and investigate a building. This is what editing is all about. I assume that the story will not support much more technically. Not much here.
