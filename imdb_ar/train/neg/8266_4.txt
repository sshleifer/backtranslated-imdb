What * bliep * is it with this movie? Can not a wicked scenario be better? All in all "Beautiful" film, but ... it was done more than once ... until the end I thought it was fine, but ... back to the previous part ... * barf * too tacky ... I was waiting for the mother to appear Imaginary God ... But wow, it did not happen ... it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> I liked Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new format with another kid wishing to be bigger / bigger; that's just something <br /> <br /> Just watch until it comes out on TV . Do not get me wrong, but it is not all that
