Another British cinema science frequency. The real trash on offer here again. I can not understand (I am British) the reason for this national nonsense. Eight years to celebrate, since the end of World War II! Another commentator commented here on the editorial and clear use of the archive sections. This is a very bad note. Archive footage in abundance. A typical plane swings from the wires in "motion scenes" like a lot of kites for children in the wind. The usual map room sequence is a tattoo film to make us attracted to the entire Malta event. Guinness must have had its worst performance ever. The viewer drops the dog again funny fighting scenes. Hawkins fills us all to death in the area of ​​the map room. Ealing made many great films. Obviously this is not one of them. They should have stayed away from unconvincing rot!
