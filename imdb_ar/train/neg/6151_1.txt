... and by no means * clean, logical, and understandable as shown in this pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches. <br /> <br /> I am 27, and I have spent 16 years of life struggling through phantasmagoria and hallucinations of paranoia. Like the main character in the film, I was mainly successful because of logic: because I kept thinking over and over again to keep the illusion away from reality and to know what was actually happening and what was not. In the end, I really succeeded because of the medication, but I certainly survived the madness because I knew before I took the medicine the difference between what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a complete scam. Not only is cheating on the story of the main character (who was not loyal to his wife, which was bisexual - something really important here), but often shows a comfortable and satisfactory view of schizophrenia - which lacks this point completely. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A person with schizophrenia is not a "normal man with a disease." He is an early person who senses and feels things that are different from most people: for him, things like time, space, and person personalities are not solid objects. Feel it can bend, it can change, it can mutate and may disappear. To deal with this, schizophrenia suffers from a very rich and creative inner world that ordinary people do not expect - but is trapped in it because it can not communicate with most people, and its world becomes poorer and poorer until it reaches a dead end. <br /> <br /> This is completely different from what is described in this pathetic funny film. They must be fearfully violent. The main non-personal people must seem strange, strange and ridiculous, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. There must be * really impressive, weird, and expansive hallucinations, because this is all about schizophrenia. It 's not about details. <br /> <br /> I mean, see "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Watch the movie "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik" and watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue" or "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on your computer, and you may have a vague idea of ​​what it looks like . You do not see the movie "Feel Good" for this month, with casual positions, characters, visuals being cleaned up and stupid plot tricks. "Cell" is the most accurate film about the mind and vision of schizophrenia and internal cohesion - it is violent and strange and confusing and very frightening. <br /> <br /> Once again, schizophrenia does not spread again the details, it's not an elegant trick, tame you played. It jumps in your face and will not let you go: the walls collapse, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you are lagging in time, I'm not sure you think you feel everything. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much more than described in these melodrama-like soap
