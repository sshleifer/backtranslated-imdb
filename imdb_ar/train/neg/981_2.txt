As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) see this very boring picture. It's the first color film for Miss Dietrich, the blondest tree in the world is redhead! Bad start. The story is a huge cavity, including a subject that bears in itself, a sense of religious guilt. (Who Needs It ???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, all the Dietrich films (and I've seen more, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only movie that does not deserve to watch its performance even. Color photography is fine (this is a very early version of Technicolor), but without any purpose. Casting is ridiculous: Jim Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (said enough?). The only thing that is of any interest at all is John Cardin's exotic caricature of "The Sand Diviner", which predicts all this. The so-called Happy End is one of the most depressing of all. Another example of David O. Selznick's bloated reputation (did he make a good film at all - unlike That One?), And for one final inconvenience, DVD MGM's soundtrack is in disarray, where random sound levels appear. Not highly recommended.
