Damn. This was the worst film I've seen in a long time. All offers are fine, but there is no plot. really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug ... Robert Duvall's personality is demented and continues to question the same people over and over again. This earns him the same responses over and over again. I'm sure this movie got six people because people think they should like it. Offers good with reputable and respected representatives, but the actual full work is steamy feces. Well, this may be tricky because the steam coming out of a new pile seems to be happening a bit and in this film nothing happens! Bag
