This is much worse than those angry cartoons of Laurel and Hardy from the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple victims of Stan's appearance. A new audience has rediscovered the genius of the comic couple, and the cartoons were the mental garbage destined to benefit the interests of the children. It was expected. But, how does one even try to rationalize this work for ... I can not even think of a word. I am sure that the manufacturers were hoping to somehow inspire the revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you can not inspire attention to the past through a shallow and unfamiliar caricature of what made the original very attractive. The Impressionists (I hesitate to describe them as actors) play Vegas and this is where they belong. The plot is more obvious than those used in the old days, trying to extend the two reel ideas to the advantage. If this movie is the first exposure to someone to Real Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure viewers will reject the reputation of the original duo because aging has faded. The only film I hate is worse. As you know, the filmmakers did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
