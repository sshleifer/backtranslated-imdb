John Huston Wise Blood was a more horrifying rendition of Flannery O'Connor than I imagined. From the very awful acting performances (and you do not do that, "Oh, I've done it deliberately, you do not get it" I!) To the music class most suited to a ring of Rockford files, this movie was disgusting. I saw it without bad will at first, and in fact, I was expecting a pleasant experience. But the distortion of the southern characters, from the cynically cynical southern line to sedition, and the comedy way of portraying their faith, is unforgivable. To the end, which was completely devoid of any sense of personality, everywhere the book of O'Connor failed to resonate and resonate. Representatives portraying "southerners" may also be eating hot dogs strewn from the streets of New York City and counting from Godfather. The performance of my distinctive Betty appeal was the pulsating and deadly portrayal of Hoffer Schuattes, a religious artist who hears Moates as preaching the Church of Christ without Christ and sees signs of the dollar and jobs. O'Connor's powerful book is the most famous of him, hidden and religious, concealing the body of faith that seems lifeless. Mr. Huston's film is a shameless mockery of the author's intentions, as understood by me and most of her admirers, if I might be too bold to say so. Although I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her work to wish to remain impressed. If you look at Blood Blood in the way Mr. Huston looked, I would throw it in the trash. For Flannery, I forgive you, John Houston. Forgetting .... it will take some time.
