A movie that has naked scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still very bored, get out of it, and that's stinky! <br /> <br /> Karen stumbles in Paris and kisses a French man and a woman who will have sex with him soon. Of course he is married, ("But, Chery, why should this be a problem?") What can be an interesting intercultural conflict is (Believe it or not) just boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film improved a lot after I left; but I had to get a better LOT to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, is running, not walking, in order to get out. Save your time and energy. Be sure to save your money. It is shameful that the production company did not save its money.
