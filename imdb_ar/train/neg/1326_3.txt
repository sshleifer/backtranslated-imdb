Dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of Hippie and Albino looking Sandra Locke. You have no idea what's going on on the screen through the annoying character "Susan" that is played repeatedly throughout the film even when "Susan's Second Coming" is over you already know hard no matter how hard you try to forget it all - > <br /> Logan's filmmaker, Jared Martin, will produce the film in the century, but it is so rude and obnoxious that no one in the banking world is willing to finance its project. Lugan plans to go alone, and then discovers this couple at a beachfront cafe, fascinated by young Susan Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knows in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> Logan's assistant and everyone around him, Clavius, Richard Dreyfus, is somehow getting a $ 740,000.00 loan from the bank to fund Logan's masterpiece that he started working on Susan by introducing her talent as an actress to attract her to Be in his film. This leaves Suzanne not only leaving her friend Simon, Paul Sand, but having Simon become very depressed and loneliness moving a gun to his mouth and exploding his brains. <br /> <br /> The film also contains two sub-plots that are somewhat unrelated to a young Dorothy autistic girl, Carrie Avalos, who was cured of autism by Susan after everyone else's failure, Psychologically committed to it. It is not really known what Susan was doing exactly in the hospital, but she looked organized or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the presence that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal patients? <br /> <br /> There is also a columnist in the newspaper and a great time businessman Jackson Sinclair, Jane Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult middle-aged crisis or witnessing a vision similar to the Bible that changed his life forever. Sinclair was looking for the meaning of life in addition to what is going on through the film and wanted to know why all this suffering in the world, such as this film, and it seems that he found the answer when the first to put his eyes on Susan. Sinclair also got some sensation in his head when his driver, David Mark Rasmusser, tired and tired of crazy and crazy hallucinations, ran off a cliff in a quiet oasis along the Pacific coast. <br /> <br /> The film "The Second Coming of Susan" continues with a number of irrelevant sequences, likely to be filled in or out at some point by the director and director of the film, and then moves to the final scene in a crucifixion like Christ on a hill as Logan has All cameras are rolling. It turned out that the crazy Logan had come up with his wonderful campaign while trying to replicate Susan, who was powerless and tied, the actual hardening of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to sit through and almost impossible to follow "The Second Coming of Susan" puts you in the same kind of torture that Susan was subjected to by Logan and the filmmakers. The film tries to be an intruder, but this is just an excuse to cover up as a useless story and not even exist, and even worse is the terrible and amateurish behavior of everyone in the film.
