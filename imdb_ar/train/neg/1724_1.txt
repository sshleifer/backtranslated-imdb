This is the movie. I imagine that if there is indeed a negative afterlife, the damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this film on a continuous loop forever. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, Hands of Destiny" ... I've seen lots of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a crispy B movie, and a bad film industry is at its best (or worse?) The thing I did not really like about this movie is the obsessed duo they gave a happy comedy. Now, the alleviation of comedy is a little good, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two predators, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, who are actually less time than them! <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, Crown International has really destroyed the film by adding bad music and doing poorly editing. But frankly, this may have been a bad film at first, so Crown could not do much to hurt him. <br /> <br /> This should really be in the lowest hundred list. I do not wish this for my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's kind of my B movie. It was bad, but I still love it, despite my classification for one star.
