There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead. <br /> <br /> It's only my opinion, but the good excitement is based on the creation of beloved and intelligent characters. As far as probability is concerned, the Ansar in Say Yes are a strange couple. Its done well. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond imagination. Let us calculate the ways in which they deal with their terror by the stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After the Rapid Park threatens to kill you, make sure you tell him about the hotel you are staying in when you descend. <br /> <br /> 2. Hit the hell of a stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thus allowing him to click on assault charges. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother to tell the police about the supplements and simply assume (without good reason) that the police have bribed him. <br /> <br /> 4. While trying to escape, leave your mistress out of sight as much as possible to ensure that she is abducted from the appendices. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find supplements after your wife is kidnapped, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so that you can meet him with one person. It's useless to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I never expect anyone to be immune from making mistakes under these difficult circumstances, but the characters in Say Yes are very dense and cause so many incredible mistakes that they are virtually impossible So that the viewer cares about their safety, because they are victims of their actions. This kills the whole movie fun. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, the script book does not stop using faint characters. Since they themselves are too hasty to write this clown, they have decided to make the positions unrealistic to the extent that every feeling of reality comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Supplements kill a policeman inside a police station ?? While the sleeping protagonist is no more than ten feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker is involved in all kinds of suspicious activities in broad daylight and about a ton of people, yet it seems that no one other than the couple is observing his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives a ridiculous amount of violence that would have killed anyone. <br /> <br /> 4. The scenes of "suspense" were not imaginative at all. In fact, some of the scenes were direct cracks of American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is the cutting of the heads near the end, which was a very brutal scene since it was attached to the wife. It's very bad that the filmmakers followed that with a terrible stupid end coming out of the left field. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Koreans should be ashamed behind making "Say Yes" of themselves. Better yet, they should move to California and work with people who make films with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
