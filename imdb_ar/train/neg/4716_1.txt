This display is dull, lame, and rips all sorts of things fundamentally to make it "original". First: the cartoon is very ugly ... Johnny is hideous ... and everyone is annoying. The twins appear as female Dexters in the teens of "Dexter's Lab", and Johnny is very similar to the most intelligent Dee Dee male (also from "Dexter's Lab.") Second: The plots ... lame painfully, making it difficult to follow. Gags are vulgar, and nothing makes me really feel like I'm forced to laugh a bit ... especially when trying to be funny. I saw only two rings, but these alone extinguished me. <br /> <br /> STOP 3: Start the entire main song by tuning it to "American Idiot". Although I am not a fan of this band, it is really stupid to take the same opening tune, then skillfully change it, to make it special. <br /> <br /> The situation at the point ... she bears a big ugly fat. 10/01
