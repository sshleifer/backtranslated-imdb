In the unlikely event that some aspiring directors read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free of charge!), From the point of view of the viewer. If you want to make a serious foreign adventure film, do it. If you want to spoof the adventures of Alien Adventures, start. Do not try to make both things at the same time, they do not work. For example, killing a "comic relief" character is clumsy, killing and cutting off his head and following him with a monkey shaking a tree and falling coconut on top of the cannibal only makes you look like you have no idea what kind of film you want to make. This one is boring, tortuous, cheap, racist .... you get the picture. A few smart moments and a few glimpse of the nudity of the shower kathy (very percy way here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason everyone forgot about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
