These were more than 80 minutes of unexpected quasi-boredom. First, I was wondering how you could produce something like that. Then, when I reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was only a few more minutes and lasted until the end that I was proud of because I was thinking of watching this movie as a wonderful test of human patience and lean tolerance. Was it worth seeing at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it, and if you're strong enough, it may last forever ... The film lacks cohesion and the characters seem to have no general sense at all. All the events in the movie, you can make sure you've seen somewhere before, and it seems to have been placed in this movie just to fill the movie reel.
