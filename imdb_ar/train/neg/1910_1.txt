I have tried to watch this alleged comedy, but it is very difficult to bear. It's a bad film, narrow-minded and vulgar. Definitely not funny, but boring and very annoying, in fact. Bad scenario, bad behavior. It is a complete waste of time - there is nothing else to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points
