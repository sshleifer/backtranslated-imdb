I like watching movies in 1930 and I'll see most of what I see in Turner Classic Movies for me. So this shot was given, after all is the great Harold Lloyd who competes with Chaplin as a wonderful film comedian. I've seen much less than Lloyd's silent films and then about Chaplin's, but I have to say I admire Chaplin. Anyway, this film fell too flat for me and I did not complete it. I can understand why his vocal career was very limited and did not get very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Louis, The Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy are doing a parody of boxing (or violence in general), this forgotten oblivion. I was also interested in watching Adolf Mango where I really enjoyed the "Paths of Glory", but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should get into boxing sooner because at least half of the film (at least it looks that way) is before it enters the ring. I can say that there are lots of Lloyd fans here and this would not be a popular review but I should rate this compared to what was there at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not see this with anyone trying to like old movies because they might not see a new movie With you again, it is very flat. As an alternative to anyone who really likes this or looks for more generally unknown comedy films, I recommend "Kelly The Second", which was introduced a few years ago, and no one else becomes a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and Charles Chase. Both were shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
