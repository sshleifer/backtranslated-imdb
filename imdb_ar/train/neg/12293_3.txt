This just happens to happen by chance because he is David Hasselhoff's star. Well, let me fail. Compared to the rubbish they call horror at the moment, this film is not so bad. She has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. It's too hot, but she can not speak well. There is a wonderful scene with her when she is raped supernaturally. She shows off her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasslehoff. 10/03
