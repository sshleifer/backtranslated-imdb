My first idea was how bad this situation was when the video case said it was one of the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of rubbish. The representation on the caliber of the sixth grade production of Oklahoma and the plot, like there was, predictable, dull and boring. 85% of the script is four letter words and countless variations. F Mother seems to be a favorite of the writer because he uses it constantly. It should take every 10 minutes to write this script in some diving in the last call. Thank God I rented it and can jump through it quickly. Do not waste your time or money with this.
