I watched the movie last weekend, and I'm angry at his disappointment. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, attend everything they can with the Old Country, and invade and take over what the Americans were working for. It is a very wrong way to look at migration, a much worse way to tell people about it. This is the main thing. Something else, comprehensive writing, direction and photography at the level of amateur village. The actors did well, but they could not save a bunch of this crap. Some jokes were funny, but most of them were bad and cheese. Can not wait to get out of the theater, you want my money.
