The film is very long and unfortunately different from the novel. If you want to watch the movie, do not read the novel first because it will shock you. Still, filming was fine, and if you're a person who likes the kinds of adventures that explore Africa, go to them. The performances are sufficient, however, many important events that existed in the novel were omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his lost brother instead of a lady looking for her father. Gagol was cunning and killed in the cave, while she found here that she was a good person preferred to stay with the new king.
