It is clear that the film's author, Stephen Greenstreet, was not clear that Michael Moore was expressing himself, but he followed his footsteps also using many of the methods of making Mour films. Moore has experience in distracting the viewer from this focus, while Greenstreet is clearly less skilled here. <br /> <br /> After being familiar with all the issues surrounding the Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that specialty paid community complaints - which paid Moore $ 40,000 of Utah educational funds to promote the John Kerry campaign And advertising his own liberal film - to the background by Greenstreet while the issues were less exciting. <br /> <br /> The marketing techniques of this video were equally biased and objectionable ... They are promoting the film by claiming that "Mormon tried to kill Moore." Not only that, but it distorts the main religion that Greenstreet clearly has some personal issues with. I followed Moore's visit closely, and all major news agencies noted that Moore's visit came and went without any credible security problems or accidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> GreenStreet relied on this film to start his career as a filmmaker so that he came out of a movie school to help speed it up. This seems to have been a big mistake in the calculation, because Moore's visits to some 60 colleges and universities across the country in 2004 weakened the attention to this fairly common event. Greenstreet's assumption that the American public is interested in this film does not seem to be because the religious angles and conservatism that have been promoted are baseless. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the film, this divided case, is somewhat a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's re-election, and thus appears to be more politically united than any other country. The split in the title of the film seems more indicative of the gap in the ideological differences that Greenstreet pursues with its religion and state. If anything, I find a comic connection between the religious corner of this alleged documentary and Woody Allen's funny argument in Sleeper (1973) that he was "beaten by the Quakers."
