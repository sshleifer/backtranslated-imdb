I think this one sucked on ice, because it left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who it is and why. CUBE never left the original cube, and left everything to your imagination. This nonsense festival however, gives you everything. I did not like it ... although acting is strong, but I think the reason is that this was done by people other than the original directors, if they had a Vincenzo Natali team, the Bricol does it, or even a supplement I think could have been better , And was more honest to the source. So I recommend you stay away from this movie, and HYPERCUBE, another movie I do not want to discuss ... (I've only given him the second acting film)
