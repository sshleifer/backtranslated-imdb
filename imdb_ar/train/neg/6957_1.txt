Avoid this one, unless you want to watch a movie that is expensive but poorly made. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a basic sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This film attempts to combine Western plots, drug intrigues and old regime clothes. What? Well, think about this. Cowboy music is hilarious during sword battles. Or what about a woman wearing her underwear, grabbed a knife and jumped up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do what the Tiger Lily Order does on this bomb. Rewrite the script, then prepare or translate it. Heck, it's almost now. (Btw, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American public, have roles).
