All about this film is a pig wash. Representation, terrible dialogue, ugly mother girls. This movie sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The manager must be the weekend bender. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what's going on. College kids are worse. No acting talent at all, very stupid thinking, just the right dumbbell. Special effects are for birds. The so-called security forces around this park belong to the playing ground: stupid-looking guns, useless wireless radios; and a computer system classed with a roll of toilet paper. If the park is under construction and nothing works, why bother inviting potential customers to get it all done. The book must be the first victims of anarchy with producers and crew. The entire film belongs to a sewage tank to another planet for viewing. What a gem. Defendants should monitor this, so they can commit suicide.
