This is a very confusing film. It is very difficult to follow the film and the plot did not seem to make sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was produced in Spain, and I think that when a film is named from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was initially concerned. Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt it can explain all the problems of this movie. Dubbing is very bad and the sounds do not match the characters well. The viewer is volatile, and there are a bunch of strange and inappropriate characters that do not further disturb the viewer. What I liked in this film was the appearance of the wolf man himself and the scenes he was attacking. Now if they can put everything together and make sense, they might have something. Do not waste your time in this one.
