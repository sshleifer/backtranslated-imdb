I know that attackers are always supposed to be bad, but come on, what the hell? He was like a handful of children at the age of 10 who made the lunch money and began filming it at the end of their week. <br /> <br /> In any case, six young men all go to the same house to kill them on the screen. Our sane person, slut, other slut, black man, killer, similar stereotypes. The others are all rushed by a person wearing a mask who is rejected by people in the poor fund. There is a decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it returns to more boredom, especially more wrong fears. We already know that it can not be a killer when a person is attacked because the person sure likes to spend his beautiful time in everything. <br /> <br /> After the death of every character you expect to die, the average ugly blonde chick will eventually be captured by the killer (they get like, pushed down and then dimmed) and the killer reveals himself. The writers of this film have just blindfolded him and put him somewhere on the list of characters. The impulse is just lame and does not even make me start stealing a curse. The murderer of course has plenty of time to explain everything (and then about ten more minutes to cut his arm for some reason) and finally overcome by a man carrying a weapon. Hey, not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. I can enjoy myself more by watching Lindsay Lohan film, I swear. I mean sure, most of the 80s have been sucked into cattle too but at least they've just thrown some T & A.This movies. Nothing happens for that.
