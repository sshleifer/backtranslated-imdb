A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one particular author. This contrasts with a recent story about a gay black artist. <br /> <br /> If this sounds obscure it is because the movie itself. It is well-directed, fairly well written and (well at most). The scenes were filmed in the past in black and white. This is also one of the few films dealing with gay men who are not ashamed of sex scenes (not that obvious and not front-end). However, this is often hated. <br /> <br /> The movie lurks everywhere, full of unwanted characters (including the protagonist) and (this is the killer) moving at a rapid pace. I thought three times about leaving the theater because I felt so bored. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His subsequent words make it clear that this was a loving act and it took 6 years to complete it. I really wish I would love this more (there are very few films that deal honestly with gay blacks) but I can not. Unless you are very interested in Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason for that.
