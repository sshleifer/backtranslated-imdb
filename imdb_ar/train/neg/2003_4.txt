Despite all the visual delights, how much would be the best renaissance in living action. The animation is great in the big picture, yes, but cool and hollow characters, much like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, the world of the film may not have felt vital. There's a lot to admire here, but in the end I found that all I could do was admire. I have not enjoyed the film very much, and it illustrates something I have never seen before: visual elements can be the positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, everything can be free. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not come with anything, but it sometimes comes dangerously close. I love dark science fiction movies. Blade Runner and Dark City are two things that I thought were fantastic. But Blade Runner had her tragic villain and the city of darkness had a story story that was thought provoking. Renaissance has a shadow and light, but a little else. I wish I had loved this film more, but the weak story and the empty characters were standing in the way. The Renaissance was a historic and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the most bleak and important films I have seen this year takes its title from the Renaissance.
