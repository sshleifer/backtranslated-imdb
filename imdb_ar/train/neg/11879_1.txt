My wife and I hired this movie because some people had painted similarities between it and the "office space". Blockbuster and IMDB have also been "recommended" if you like Office Space. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen Office space maybe 15 or 20 times. love it. Probably one of my favorite ten movies. Brilliant and humorous, she has characters that remind me of the people I've worked with over the years. The Haikou Tunnel is similar to the "office space" as two. Where the similarity ends. Perhaps we sat during the first 50 minutes of HT, which gave her the benefit of doubt, hoping, prayed, * pray * to improve. he did not do. We could no longer take it, and we stopped the tape. Thankfully it was a free rental. I had been told if we were already paying for it. We must be compensated for having to sit down. Now, as we have not seen the end, it may come as a miracle and re-make itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is very bad and it's hard to believe that it was ever produced. The movie is very strange it's painful. Just e-friggin messages already! The hypothesis is asinine. Jokes are awful. We got beyond the "Printer Not Working" scene and we had to stop. We can no longer take it. This film is a footnote to Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you love Office Space ...... do not waste your time with this feces. 0/10
