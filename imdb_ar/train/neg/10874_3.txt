I have just finished the marathon of this series, and it is painful to watch as it progresses. Starting with the imagination of historical elements, even the terrible O'Herlihy tone in subsequent episodes, the presentation completely abates. If you are looking for some low-quality World War II butter, I can recommend the first season, but avoid anything then, it turns into a single step of the soap opera, with increasingly story lines and sensitivity. <br /> <The old B & W is the best of any kind of entertainment with the name Colditz attached to it, and so this is not what one would hope.
