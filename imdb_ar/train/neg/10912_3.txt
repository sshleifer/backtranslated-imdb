I did not like this movie very much at all. It was not really funny, and in some cases it was just plain stupid. Rob Schneider is certainly a very gifted person, and although his behavior was good, it seemed like a real waste to stare at. I mean there were some parts that were okay and fairly humorous in a nice way but around it. The only thing that caught my attention already during this whole ordeal of the most jokes was the presence of some very good looking females and I am not the only one to watch a movie just because of it but in this case it was the only nook where even the lowest redemption could be found. All in all was just a few less than an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final Inquiry: <br /> <br /> Theaters: Very happy because I have not wasted a lot of money on this. <br /> <br /> Buy a DVD: Ummm, let me think .... NO! <br /> <br /> Leasing: If you have a sense of prehistoric humor why not.
