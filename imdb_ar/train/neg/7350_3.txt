Despite the bad reviews, only I had to give this movie a chance ?? She is, after all, a star of HK super babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovers as a team of wild thieves. Surely this is worth checking out? Well, as children's festivals continue, it's hard to beat Martial Angels. Eye candy is top quality. Xu Chi looks as wonderful as always, and for the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandbrook and Amanda Strang watched my wandering eye in particular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if someone will judge this movie with any other potential advantages. , An absolute stink! The story is weak, the work is lousy and the pathetic touches are patently pathetic. The director gave Clarence Fook and producer Proonger Wong Jing a photography team and so on. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you think of seeing him, it's best to see Sex and Zen 2 again!
