**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Certainly without a doubt, one of the most extreme storyboards created on screen. It is absolutely impossible to take any of this seriously. It will take a great novel to recount all the comedy routine in it. During the days of glory in her show, Carroll Burnett and his often-filmed film company distorted the film in ways that were hard to imagine. Carole played the role of Jenny, who was suddenly suffering from mild cough and immediately appeared the traitorous music and looked around them wondering about their source. Harvey Korman played Oliver With flowing locks he almost seems to like Ryan O'Neill. The only fun thing about this thing is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene in the end. Jenny really looks like she's dying so well ... she dies in order for her make-up artist to come and give her a little color. Of course, we all know how often a hospital encourages a family member to sleep with them during the last moments of the patient. The end scene with Ryan O'Neill sitting on a bench in the snow thinks of his future in cinema is an instant classic. He had a lot to worry about. He did not recover from this.
