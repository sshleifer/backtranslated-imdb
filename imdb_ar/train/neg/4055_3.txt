I have read reviews that it is clear that you must be a student at a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand this. This may be true, if so, this film is old. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can leave, but they do not. The reasons why they go to this are illogical. There is not enough personal development to explain why. What is supposed to mean shooting at a group of innocents is not explained or implied. War is the final creative expression, and may be the only revelation that any characters in this film show, and it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The characters who start a murder do not fight the institution, they only kill people. I thought they probably used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least a sanctuary in the end, it would have a more symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This movie is the dream of teenage dreams in fighting against the power that plagued them, even though they actually need it. It has no moral or symbolic truth or meaning; this film simply presents the fantasy of killing teachers and people in the "power" that bothers you. <br /> <br /> If you think that shooting at a school or shooting a school like Columbine or Virginia is a rational and sensible way. Treat the teachers and institutions you do not like, then I think you will love this film. If you are like me and are working to bring life to yourself rather than blindly rebel (very blindly in this film) against "man", this film is young and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also explain in parts that the funding was nonexistent, and the story seems to suffer from attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> In general, this seems like a rough draft of what might be good, but no effort has been made in dialogue, personal development, or moral, so it ended badly. <br /> <br /> If only ... I could restore my watch.
