This piece of waste, since I can not call it a film, can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> - A typical black criminal with a black dwarf partner faces a problem - Black Midget pretends to be a child with a fully developed adult face and body hair and genitals - the black dwarf is mistaken (one way or another) by a man and a woman who happen to want a dwarf Rather than continuing to commit physical and sexual violence, insulting white people wherever he sees fit, and committing more crimes - a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it would have been a good satire if it was not pointed in a shallow way He has such unrepentant villains.
