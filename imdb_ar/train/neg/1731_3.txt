The Twilight Zone has made certain legends about it - like Star Trek. That's because there are many loyal exhibition enthusiasts, no matter what you think of each episode. They are the people who register for each individual who has 10 views and can not objectively evaluate the offer. Because of this, over a period of time, I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall rankings and reviews were very positive. Now, it's time to do the same with The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While many episodes have been recorded 10, this episode gets 3 because it simply was bad. The writing was actually embarrassingly bad. Two of the warring parties in a major war see the whole episode. After a while, they are obviously the only remaining people on earth - as you learn in the stupid and completely unconvincing conclusion. Usually the twisting in the end makes the ring wonderful - this is killing it!
