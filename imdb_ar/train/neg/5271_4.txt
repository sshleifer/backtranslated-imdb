A family of American bickering, vacationing in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. They only know that this ghost town was once a site for testing nuclear bombs, and there is a killer chasing them. I generally like mysterious horror movies like this. "Cube", "Duel", "Spielberg" and "The Birds" are all great examples of films that do not provide answers, but nevertheless make us intrigued and want more. Apparently, the writer / director of "Disappearance" Walter Klenhard is trying to produce this kind of films, and whether he succeeded or not, it is left to the viewer. Personally I think it came half way, then the movie sank. <br /> <br /> The actors are all "just humorous." They are not particularly bad, but we are an audience that never feels afraid and reactes to situations in unrealistic ways. Is there anyone else outperforming his characters to go out in search of exotic sounds?!?!? At least give them some kind of justification to do it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As far as movies designed for television are presented, it is definitely above average. The director Klenhard should be commended for truly milking the desert environment for all that it offers and some wonderful places. There is a really wonderful scene where two people find an ancient land of nuclear testing, where the sand has melted completely on the glass until you see the eye. I wonder if it's real? <br /> <br /> There is no gore to talk about, and "creatures"? Or what is the hell that happens after these people never appear, let alone not even give a real idea about what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts, or evil old Indian spirits? Oh, that really narrow us!) Or where Come. <br /> <br /> There are lots of cliches here as well. Why are the popular cities in these types of movies always really, really stupid? Why is there always an old man who thinks everyone is crazy and has turned out to be true? why? why? why? How to bout a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" tries to be different and clever, but in many ways it eventually fails. It is very familiar to us for lovers of direct horror to the video. Hey, I've seen far worse movies, and the disappearance is not bad, it's also too big ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
