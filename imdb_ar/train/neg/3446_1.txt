This movie looked on paper like it could be good, after watching it although I realized that this movie was absolutely terrible !! No sense to the plot, I think I figured the best part of the 5000 scenes cut, making the film more boring and bland. I saw this stadium late at night, and there was no noise at all to add it to SCARINESS. But the truth is that the only thing that scared me was music, what they call tragic music, they play opera, I mean to be serious !! This film sums up everything that is not good about this kind of movies. To be honest, do not say more but watch at your own risk this movie is just a complete garbage, enjoy !!
