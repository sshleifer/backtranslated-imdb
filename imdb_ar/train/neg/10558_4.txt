I do not know why this has crowds, and I do not know why I gave it the result I got. This is useless. There are many giallo where one has to suspend infidelity, let the pictures scroll down and catch up with him somewhere before he becomes meager and some poor police officers must explain what we saw in the end. But, this is too little for him and he has long chains where nothing happens and nothing to do with him while we have to listen to the most frequent soundtrack, even according to Italian standards. Not giallo, this is a whole set of horror ideas that show Klaus Kinski in one of his most rude "phone calls". I think he attended, did a day's work and got rid of Mr. Damato's departure to get others to fill the void. Ewa is beautiful of course but not enough, and in the end we saw a lot of her appearance everywhere, after a long time we lost our full attention to this reckless and tasteless puzzle. Maybe I was not in a good mood!
