How can anyone say that this movie is comedic ?? If I had not gone then, I would have slept and asked to refund my money. I loved Gwyn Paltrow, but it was as if they were in the wrong group. I love most chick clicks, but I hated this. This is the only time I've seen a lot of rock and it's not turned on. These groups were exaggerated. No one is talking this way anymore and I do not think they did it. The dancing part was terrible. He said to me later, "Did not you like this part, do not you think it was sensitive?" I said yes only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we never married. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
