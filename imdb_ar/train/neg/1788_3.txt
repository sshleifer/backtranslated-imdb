The granting of the balance when it is due, deserves only a technical mention of art, fashion and collections. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt the lowest point in BONG CROSBY's long march in Paramount. The script is as clumsy as you can imagine and neither Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything about fixing it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very foolish in a boy's page wig. Poor Ronda Fleming has a role as a fashion champion on the stock exchange, requiring her to peek into Ping and other small things except to jam some uninvited songs with a voice called the occasion. <br /> <br /> Just a terrible thing! Novelty Mark Twain is not clear in any scenario. Only Crosby fans can appreciate this chaos in a film in the light of the uninspiring trend. So the plugins look as if they do not know what they are supposed to do. <br /> <br /> Summary: dull as pure water. Not recommended, even for children.
