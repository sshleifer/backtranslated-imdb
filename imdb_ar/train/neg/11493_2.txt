St√∂rtebeker is one of the worst mini TV serials ever on the planet. <br /> <br /> The representation is unbearable and the historical background is often nonsense: two examples only: Visby was presented as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a major city at this time, it's the best days already passed. Second, Hamburg was never a city that cared about pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, and was the main city at that time for Lubeck. <br /> <br /> But worst of all: guidance! How could such a man be allowed to take out a movie like that? impossible! There was not one credible scene, the battles were ridiculous and I could not suppress the laughter in most of the harsh scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not understand at all how a major television station can not.
