Bella Lugosi is a wicked botanist who sends poisoned brides orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in the fake ambulance / heart, and takes him home to help the dwarf extract the adenic juices to keep Bella's wife forever young. Some second-class actors who play investigators try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi holds her gently, but you can say he needs the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely awesome, and it was better for most actors to stick to the waiting tables, but the plot is absurdly absurd. Tell anyone what's going on there and they tend to laugh a lot and ask to watch the movie. I got a DVD in a 2 discount shop for Â£ 1, which I think is a very accurate evaluation, anyone paying more for it would be out of place.
