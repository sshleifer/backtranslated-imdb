Absolutely stupid. I think the guys who danced at the beginning of Steven Seagal's movie were planning to mock Jeff, who was performing his music at the beginning of this stupid film. The plot was predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff acted as well as the couch that beats out with a kind of weapon in one scene.
