I'm not familiar with the trilogy but this film came last night on Showtime. The film looked very good with the group's design and cinematography, but the film's script was delightful and sensational. The acting was rather bad, as the two operas were serviceable. You did not really believe anything the supporting actors said. There was a priest of stunning stereotypes without a hint of nuances, the official captain, the soldier with his hot head, and so on. I'm sorry to say that based on these flaws, you immediately registered CADN without knowing that they end credits Telefilm Canada gave it. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something at first but the hostility towards the girls was never explained. Here they are surrounded in a fortress by wolves and men wasting time and energy and treating two young women without cause. Focus on people. There is a more urgent position outside your walls a little more than whether these girls are lesbians or not, and this is just a deductive of the hostility directed toward it. If they can fire a gun and shoot, they may be nice to them. Their "eternal spirit" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I think this is about the rest of the trilogy, are these girls supposed to be heroes? One of them killed an Indian man at the end who saved the life of one of them. I think that someone is just a victim of her situation and can not necessarily be blamed for her actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve a happy ending.
