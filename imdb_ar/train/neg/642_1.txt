First of all, if you are a comedian, well, you'll be very disappointed I'm sure! Low budget movie! It is assumed that Largo Serbia in the comedy film, suddenly became a Croatian now! The producers of the chicken, gave some spice and courage to the comic (by the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... lol). Becomes the building of N.Y. Winch is a stunning mid sized yacht popular in the UK. Good-looking Largo becomes some Tzigan / Turkish looking guy. Freddie pilot 'Scarface' cool becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, ordinary man. Simon, a good friend of Largo, does not exist at all !? I gave some peppers! Largo does not throw knives at all, but just gazes some snake ... The whole story is confused and seems to be a buzzing TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money or capacity or technology to adapt properly with a comic, please stick to some of the romance that was filmed in Paris. Very bad movie too, a good thing I just hired, do not count on watching the sequel (if there is any!).
