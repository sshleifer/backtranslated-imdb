There can not be any questions about the vandals of this film. The director took us out and spoiled this film in several ways. <br /> <br /> There has been a blatant break-up of things like Critters and Grimlines, the film has failed at many levels to restore the humor and horror of those better-made films. It ends up being a waste of time, with bad actors giving a bad talk to an idiot manager, sometimes throwing stuffed toys at them. They wrestle with the toys in the same way that old Tarzan films used rubber crocodiles, shaking them while screaming and doing their best to make them look a little threatened. It's painful to see him, and his mental fashion does not help him in the 1980s worn by the cast. <br /> <br /> Essentially, some of the crazy little aliens trapped by an old security guard in many movies get free after a period of emperors. Years of confinement, and start to screw the distance with the minds of people. The new recruit in the guard, the idiot who has been allowed out despite repeated warnings, assembles his gang of 80 friends together, exploding and getting small adventures together while trying to recover Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with a gang consisting of a jock with a knuckle head, a girlfriend in his 80s, a cold-blooded and cold-blooded heroine, and a little hero who lacks confidence and wishes his girlfriend would work anyway. <br /> <br /> First, comes the scene of the infamous firefight, where the former military jockey shows how he was trained in the army to be mutant, the arrogant hero poked the wrong end of the rake for what seemed like hours. Then there is some jogging, and ends in a real circular fighting style ending in a noisy nightclub with comic grenades blowing up everything except the people who stand right next to them. Then the movie ends, and it ends well. <br /> <br /> It is not. Like watching a train wreck, you can not close your eyes, it's very bad. Perfect fare for the Mysterious Science Theater, but you should watch it alone without worrying. Fashion Fashion still has a number of outstanding orders for the actors, and I dare not laugh at anyone in the open irony of the fighting. This records 2 out of 10 at most, in a good day.
