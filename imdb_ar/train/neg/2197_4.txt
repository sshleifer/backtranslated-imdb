This person hears again the days of the apprentice, when the children who have nowhere else to hang out their dates to the balcony after throwing their younger siblings below. No matter what was on the screen - young children were sitting in it and young children would ignore it. Of course, adults will never see it. <br /> <br /> But they put it on a video, anyway, along with most other horror clicks of the low-budget "B" in the Golden Age .. from the TV. The innate and unintended humor of this film is derived from the meaningless ideology ("bad girls" harvested to replace the body of Jan, the poor crusader, "they had a conspiracy"), an excessive conspiracy (a crazy world, trying to play God) Is not explained in the rural laboratory of the world which seems so natural to date completely), and acts polarized in the form of wood or on the desktop. <br /> <br /> It is a great movie for parties, assuming that your guests enjoy adding dialogue In fact, if you or your guests prefer more entertainment For my part, this film is also available on video in its "Mystery Science Theater 3000", where the host and puppet of the TV series cultivate the necessary additions to you.
