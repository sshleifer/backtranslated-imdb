Hitchcock's film bears little resemblance to his later suspicious films and seems a much more ancient moral tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they think will make them happy. They spend money traveling around the world and have a very enjoyable life. However, after a period of time the excitement begins to fade and the couple becomes separated and meaningless in their presence. However, without a place, when on a luxury cruise, the ship drowns and loses everything - and ends up happier in the end because they appreciate life now! What a strange film and silly sermon! Personally, I would inherit all this money and see if it makes me miserable! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively poor compared to subsequent productions - a rough film with poor sound quality and somewhat amateurish acting.
