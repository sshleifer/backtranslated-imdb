During the first 20 minutes or so (I was watching it on the PS2, so I have no idea how long it took) Alienator puts an interesting hypothesis. I do not think I saw a strange film with a foreigner from another planet like the Badi before. However, the interest quickly turns into unbelievable disbelief and you realize that the "alien" is a huge woman who builds the body in a solid bikini. Yes, Alienator is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not think I oppose it. In a world of horror, it can be often ironic a good sign. However, the stark stupidity of his premise is that every film has really gone for it. Alienator is funny like hell, but it is also a lament game of the highest levels. Actors accumulate on failed attempts of seriousness, and possible lines of genius have stumbled into a dialogue of pure cheese with disturbing incompetence and failure of direction in summing up one or two decent groups. By the time the film ends, you can barely see the original concept through a full haystack collected by the team. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the "alien" kills people just by steaming them, unlike doing any "cut" in this way you have a huge pile of flickering good ideas that are left to rot. You'll laugh at Alienator, but at it, not with her. If this is your thing then go ahead and check it out.
