Now, I've seen a lot of bad movies. I love bad movies. Special motion movies are bad. I have seen (and enjoyed) all the Jean-Claude Van Damme films, including the film in which he plays his own character, both playing twins, and all three of his films are Cyborg. I already own a guy who plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck filled with two leagues. (Hey, if there's nothing else, it's got a great recent and you've always seen it.) With DVD, you can pause and zoom!) That's why you can trust me when I say this movie is very bad, <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. Bad collections. The battles are bad. Erotic bad. Forex is bad. The representation is very bad, and the second time the Earth is very likely to present the worst performance for each actor called in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, which is something that really says. I would be willing to bet that everyone involved in this film is lousy in bed to take off. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It is unintentionally funny, so it is not a complete loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a morbid fool or very stoned. I managed to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something distracting me from rinsing Paul the cat from the wash. <br /> <br /> This did not help much, but it was better than nothing. One point of the veil is Ron Palillo as a gay burn.
