Sorry for all, I know this is supposed to be a "technical" film, but they have to distribute guns on the screen so people can blow their brains and not see them. Although the scene design and direction of photography were excellent, this story is very painful to watch. The absence of the soundtrack was brutal. The loooonnnnng footage was very long. When can you see two people sitting there talking? Especially when the dialogue two people complain. I have really experienced a difficult time in this film. The presentations were excellent, but how many things are dark, gloomy, uninspiring, can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise this was a rip of Bergman. I am not a fan of him. I think anyone who says they enjoyed an hour and a half is, well, lying.
