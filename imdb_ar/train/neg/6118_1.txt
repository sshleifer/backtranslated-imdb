This is not a good novel of Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in an orange! Bo Derek in "10" was a comedy and at least there was a reason for nudity and sex. This film is nothing more than soft porn. If you are in this, well, get ready and go ahead and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was once again a way for Derek to show off her terrible representation. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but her poster is more exciting than this film! Richard Harris was a better actor; this was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time in this movie ... Go buy the book instead.
