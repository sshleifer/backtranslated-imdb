This is a blatant future adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island." Editing sound is very bad. You hear the dialogue on a group and you hear the sounds that are recorded in the recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston and picked up all over New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd who read this comment, they will be created with a capital of W. You can hear the director's voice giving guidance and giving directions to the actress. "Well now stand up." As for other characters. There is this man who speaks with his mind instead of his voice and this strange alien. The foreign man speaks in a deep voice. When he yawns or screams when he fights he hears the voice of the actor. The special effects, man! This was the early work of Britt Piper to scream out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is convulsive. Really jerky. Type of animation like Carl Zeman's Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955). Special effects are creative. Music Thge is good. To sum up, this film makes EQUINOX or Planet Dinosaurs look like an epic Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoe chain budget? Must watch for ambitious filmmakers.
