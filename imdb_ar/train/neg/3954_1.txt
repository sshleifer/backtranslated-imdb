ENTIRE MOVIE is a memoir of Boogeyman's first film, as well as footage from Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love about Brainwaves. They were framed with some more recent footage (from the early 90's anyway) boring footage, badly acted and picked up cheaply. Not only is the film memories of the past almost full, but it repeats the same memories of the past throughout the film. So you see the recycled section again and again, as if you have not already seen it. As if the original copies were not bad enough. I have never seen a very padded film ... someone was milking the last dollar of these films. Total Rip. He talked about padding ... Why should I write 10 lines about this garbage? If you can convey that it is rubbish in two lines, this should be enough.
