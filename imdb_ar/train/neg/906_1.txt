Yes, this film makes me feel real horror, when I realized I paid for it and spent more than an hour in my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just gave me the impression that I was a psychologist and a girl who was the worst actress I had ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time, avoid this movie, I understand that the film needs to create money and some movies do not have the money, but this is not a justification for stupid plot and misconduct. I always support independent films, when they deserve support, but similar films make a bad name for this type of film. I still feel shocked. I will trust no nice cover anymore.
