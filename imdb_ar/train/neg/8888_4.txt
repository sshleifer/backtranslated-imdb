I have evaluated Basic Instance 2 high, but this film earned less than 4 ratings. The film got only 4 of me, but it has 7.3 of over 600 people. I do not see why they like this film very much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, because it hardly leaves those rooms in this big broken house. It contains only a total of 5 people in this film. Nearly two hours long which is absolutely unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue which is frustrating to watch. The movie can be shortened to a few sentences only. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three Times" directed by Hu Hsiao Hsin, that the film is equally boring, and the dialogues are also boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching that story after the first story was over. <br /> <br /> This film lacks passion or excitement.
