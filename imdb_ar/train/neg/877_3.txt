I was delighted to see this film with the expectation that it would be a complement to the classic "personal lessons" that represent worship and portray the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Special Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I'm referring to. It's just a normal flick of the Cinemax kernel that will not make a difference in your life. There is one hot sexy scene on the roof but that's it. I've seen this for a long time but believe me, it's just a dull ordinary dull click. <br /> <br /> Women are lanes but this is not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to watch this only if it is broadcast on the cable.
