This movie starts very slowly, but when the action finally begins, it has to be followed a little. I could not understand why some events took place, and many events happened before they were explained, making them confusing. The only thing that actually happens is the huge amount of blood / wound you experience, although most often there are no special effects. Blood appears like Kool-Aid Red. It seems that the skin rupture looks like someone stepping over a pile of sticks. Again, telling the story about the amateur feeling of it, like the writer did not take long to master. I feel it could be a much better film if the effects were better and took longer in the script. I sincerely hope that I did not see him, not because of the nonsense, but because I felt that I had lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like great movies, you'll stay away from you if you do not.
