This lower part of the Slasher film may not fit this modest, but it is definitely a very bad film. <br /> <br /> The holiday hypothesis made him interesting, but after his first viewing, the film showed he was bad. Production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, this subtype was currently about invisible, obsessive adolescents without obvious reasons, but it took too long. There is no coherence in events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> Cliches are more than boring, and the glare is too small, as is the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly modest italic entry that should not be set even if it contains a nastie label for the video. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed because of this overblown garbage.
