People like me will tear this film apart. It's not realistic. The plot is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens comfortably, of course, find the treasure and become rich and dirty, and deceive the bad man. We've seen it a million times before. The film's authors should think that the majority of the films being put to the public are stupid. They must be right because the majority of people really liked this film. I mean solving puzzles in a few seconds. Secret treasure room hidden under Metro Manhattan? You think with all the work that has been in New York underground that room has been discovered before. And all that was built during the civil war? Please and the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? How cute, I believe that romance in Clive Cussler novels was weak. They fall in love like this, in two seconds, yet I will be more interested in saving my ass and then getting some. Hell with the girl and a stupid piece of paper. 1/10 garbage
