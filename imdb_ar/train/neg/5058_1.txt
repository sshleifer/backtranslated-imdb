(When will I ever learn?) Made me an ecstasy reviewer on NPR I think this turkey was another Ken citizen. Please allow me to vent my spears ... <br /> <br /> I will confess: The setting, which is supposed to be New York City, was not ugly and unattractive. I remember that the 1970s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all smoking! If the plan was to reduce the characters, it worked. <br /> <br /> For the film to work (at least, in my humble estimation), there must be at least one sympathetic person. Just approached Ned Beaty and could not wait until Nicky finished. If one of the stray shots had hit Mickey, it might have provoked outrage at most. <br /> <br /> I can not remember when you hate the movie severely. I suppose I'm a rioter who does not dig "professional" clicks. Oh, okay.
