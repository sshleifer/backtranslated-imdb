If you have not lived in the 1990s or never listened to rapper !! This movie may be right for you, but none of the fans or anyone who listened to the rap was boring, and there was no point in the film where I said it was interesting or did not know it. The other thing that bothered me was that it made it seem like something in his life was so easy, there was no conflict that made the prison look easy, selling drugs, and even rap music was not realistic. I think if the movie that was shown about 15 years ago, it might have a bigger impact maybe !!! Rap movies are good at crowding and streaming, and getting rich or die is not notorious
