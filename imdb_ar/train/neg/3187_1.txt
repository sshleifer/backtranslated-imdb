From "MITCHELL" star, director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are lines that would normally prevent me from watching this movie. The worst part is that all the above data are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film. It's like a bad remake of "Cogan Bluff"
