This is not one of those reviews about bad special effects, technology, or history, the issues that only the most dorkiest people can relate to, but a review of the story story, which most of us really care about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of a mix of World War II Allied members and members of the German Navy, two civilians (the hero and the heroine), are traveling together on the U-German boat and end up in a wild dinosaur land. <br /> <br /> Manipulation is not bad according to film standards, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. What movies like this need are reliable and beloved characters, along with some manifestation of mind in actions. <br /> <br /> This film lacks both. For the full-length movie, only 6 characters are presented at any time, and barely 3 are seen. Champion Chlorine is a "routine", and has no great meaning in any era. <br /> <br /> It seems that the female is looking for an answer to the mystery about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the puzzle is not so many puzzles, we can care less. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of failure in the film was supposed to be better, even for his time.
