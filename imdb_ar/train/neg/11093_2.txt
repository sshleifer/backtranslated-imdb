If this film about a fictional character, the film can stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film relies on unfairly "facts" about Robin Carter. Many smaller facts were ignored (Carter was not the number one contender at the time of the murder, there is no evidence at all that he saved a friend from a child harassing his youth), but some larger facts, such as the apparent theft of a decision by Joy Giardillo because of the " Racist ", is unforgivable for those of us who have watched the fighting on the tape, and completely disrespectful to Girillello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from someone who was, at best, in trouble, and about a much more problem than any ordinary person (who has been arrested several times for beating women) is strange to me. By presenting his actions in the 1960s and until now, Robin Carter never refused to talk to his son, a person who could be seen by people. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and that Washington can act, but why they chose this story because their car overtook me. Does Hollywood need a hero so black that it needs to bend the truth in all its vital forms to make it believable? (Heres a suggestion about what Denzel plays about himself? Now this inspirational) Based on all the mistakes in the film, I would suggest passing this movie.
