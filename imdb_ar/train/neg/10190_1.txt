After watching this on an MST3K ring, you should be wondering about the number of movies borrowed by this movie. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and several other elements at least. At one point, I really expected Chris Makpis to contact Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes are in the plot. Such as the fact that although gas is not available, there are plenty of it at abandoned gas stations, stations are located near each other to keep the F1 race car going around the country.
