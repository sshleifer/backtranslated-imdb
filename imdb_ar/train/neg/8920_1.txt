... but this must be the worst adaptation of Christmas Carol of all time. This requires some work, with various efforts throughout life. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Sisley Tyson. I have enjoyed it greatly in other roles (see Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives her no choice but to chew the scene. And chewed, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim that connects the Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. Distinguished efforts to understand the spirit of Christmas past, present or future.
