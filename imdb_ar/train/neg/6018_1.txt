I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we should make films like "Left Behind". We have much better stories to know that you do not have to be too preaching. I was very disappointed with this film. As an ambitious director who believes in Christ, I see this film as the perfect example of what I will not do in my career in the film.
