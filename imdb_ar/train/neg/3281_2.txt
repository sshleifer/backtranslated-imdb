I had doubts that the film would be bad. I am a fan of Duke Duke. You have three years of TV series on DVD. Well I've been right. Family took to see it. I really wanted to see the jump again and some of the good chase scenes were good. But to sum it up, the film was a vile version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy clothes were equally clear, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply bad. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle should also be in their graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are a fan of the dukes who have been tried and tested like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
