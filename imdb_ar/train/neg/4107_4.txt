The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that once you've searched for this movie and invested the time to watch it, you're making more effort in the experiment than many of its directors, especially director Sam Pickenba. <br /> <br /> The already troubled Peckinpah was heading to harsh weather with this movie. According to at least one biography, this was where you knew cocaine. Add to that bragging when drinking, no wonder the disintegration of things. <br /> <br /> It's a disgrace, because the concept behind the film is a good one, and the first 10 minutes are a lot. Mike Locken (James Kane) and George Hansen (Robert Duval) are private contractors doing so much dirty work for the CIA. They move quickly, live well, seem to be the best friends - and then something happens to break up their brothers. <br /> <br /> An opening scene showing a building is being blown up - why not exactly tell us the course in terms of the mysterious motive of this film. But the implication is that these people annoy people and do not really care - antidotes are very similar to the Wild Punch game in Bikinba not long ago. The opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, then adds a clear language in the cheek. "The idea that the CIA might use to employ such an organization for any purpose, of course, is useless." This is a very smart way to tell the public that all bets are off. <br /> <br /> A traditional strong Peckinpah backup, including Burt Young, Gig Young and Peckinpah, regularly adds Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a crazy man who can not miss an opportunity to be picked up for $ 500 a day, You just want the scriptwriter, including the famous Sterling Clevant, to try to do something more with the story instead of turning it into a platform for laziness. Linings and bad knockoffs sock seal. There is an attempt to inject a dose of social and puzzling liberal comments. "You are too busy doing their dirty work, you can not tell who the bad guys are," says one Lucien, as if he or we needed it. pointed to. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the clumsy Beckenba direction and slow speed. We are 40 minutes from the film before we get the first scene of the battle, a group of random chaos of random shots where a handful of people we've never met before are seen fighting at San Francisco airport, their battle intertwined with a conversation in a desk set. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the rest of the cast is a battle inside a fleet of oil-filled victory ships, and the ninja runs out in the open to be shot while Kwan sets off one of the hardliners that undermines any hint of real thrill. "Put me seven to five, I'll take the little man," he said before a period of samurai climate between two battles of ninja warriors - from China, which we all know is the land of ninja. (The battle is going on in San Francisco, but it is not surprising that a mountain does not reach a mountain to break things). <br /> <br /> He was much better at the smaller scenes, just as he tells Locke, recovering from some bad injuries, by someone from his superiors, played by Arthur Hill smoothly, that he was "neglected" by the organization. He refused to stay down, watching him heal, despite the driving force of the film, with good acting and Amy Hofflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse. He was one of the best actors in the 1970s, and his obscure overtures with Hufflin, Duval, and Hopkins, both Youngs, give Keller Elite a real possibility of life. <br /> <br /> But you do not see Keller Elite thinking about it. Watch him thinking about the movie that has gone away.
