This film was produced by a group of white men who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, but it seems to have been made by a group of white men who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males of the same age. It looks like watching a group of boys in the boys' camp who turned the camera on themselves. The film has no plot. It simply repeats the same procedure from the blood bath after the blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedy bits. But they do not recover flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Animations are used to cover things that clearly exceed their budget or resources to perform, and have not been well implemented in this regard. Anything that can not be done with white guys running on the beach covered with blood is done by cheap cartoons. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after watching the trailer, making it look like a Tarantino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they have always been. The rest of it only repeats the same kind of mundane comedies. It works sometimes, but it becomes boring after things come to you again and again. It's like a series of Satoday Night Live plays from a movie. It's a kind of comedy that hits you. I can see where the idea of ​​the story is interesting. But, in this post-apocalyptic film America is very much like Medevil England. In fact, Whitley says the story's ideas came from that era. He's planning to do part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarantino or maybe he's doing something ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At the opening in Los Angeles, Whitley stated that he would return largely to the same actors in part 2. He was asked if he might think of a more diverse team in the next section, which answered him, yes, sure.
