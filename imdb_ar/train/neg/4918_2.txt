A wealthy Harvard man hangs over the poor Radcliffe chick to the point of his father's strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> A sweet, sugary story and, most of all, a naive story about the battle of "classes" when Ryan O'Neill, the rich, brings an office house to the cynical librarian. Ali McGraw is the social loser with the dirty mouth while John Marley plays her religious Catholic father, but no one in the film is more disturbing than O'Neill himself with his pulsating portrayal of Harvard's outstanding hero. <br /> <br /> followed by 8 (!) years later by Oliver's Story.
