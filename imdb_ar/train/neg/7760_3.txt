In the Fiji Islands, the owner of Valalola Resort Primal Park calls on unscrupulous greed investors and guests to attend the opening ceremony of his hotel and zoo complex to find partners for his discoveries. When a group of small thieves set the time in college virus in the security system to participate in the hunt for scavenger, the greatest attractions in the zoo ?? sabretoothes from the prehistoric era developed from DNA found in fossils? Escape, killing hosts and guards for fun. <br /> <br /> The incredibly cheap and wondrous "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters are awful and not funny or fun and the story is awesome Jurassik Park is horrible with a bad set of cliches. All lines and positions are basically stupidity and stupidity, but the winner is when the guard explains that the spinach is flat and wants to kill for fun. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The Attack of the Sabretooth")
