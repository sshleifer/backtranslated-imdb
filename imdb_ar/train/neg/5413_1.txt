After a reasonably successful MASTI that was better than Inder Kumar returned with the comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL <br /> <br /> The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and the deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a hard exercise <br /> <br /> The movie contains jokes like this nonsense and you do not feel like you laugh like the head of Snehal Dabi getting involved in the back of the horse and all These comic types that we do not laugh at now but make fun of them <br /> <br /> The film begins in a vulgar way, and some scenes funny Unfortunately, such moments do not last long because the story never moves in this half J Comedy is boring. The twist is handled well and the second half becomes an action movie where the blind and deaf man goes to save the heroines and we have all the scenes of OTT and the scenes chasing. <br /> <br /> Direction by Inder Kumar Bad music is fine, one song stands out I love you angelic /> <br /> Vivek is great in comedy scenes, its timing is very bad and quite a dangerous scene. For some reason he continued to do comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan was the best, but very wooden. Among the rest, Isha and Amrita are Iranian Iranian pianists who harass here Sinhal Dabi fine
