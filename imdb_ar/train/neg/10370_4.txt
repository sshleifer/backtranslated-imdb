I regret every single second of lost time while watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I always find it difficult to turn off a movie as soon as I start watching it. Especially when it's classic or what people use for a classic label. I think this is one of those movies that every movie lover should have seen at least once, and that's why I saw her. Do not get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall as a couple and as actors, but this was a big scam in my opinion. No really good plot, no spy flick nor romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing combination of these two types. The only thing that caused the tension is that it is uncertain whether "Buggie" and "Buckal" will remain together at the end or part of the other. I think "Have Have Have Not Got" was too exaggerated and Bogart was in many of the best films during the 1940s.
