The new Tim Burton edition of The Original Planet of the Apes (1968) and the Charlton Heston series are far from the quality and origin of the plot. <br /> <br /> Certain special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was awful. I sat through the entire movie with a friend (I only rented it happily) and fully understood why, before Christmas, all the "Planet of the Apes" games in Target were in the clearing box. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put this in your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone: Watch the 1968 film Planet of the Apes.
