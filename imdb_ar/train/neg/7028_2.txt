Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's, the commercial center in this film contains an explosive store. This is the only place where the character of the title <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he plants at the mall in the dim end. <br /> <br /> A fictional city with a new shopping center, built on some land was <br /> <br /> condemned. Cute Girl (I did not mention her name) gets a job as a waitress. <br /> <br /> There. She lost her boyfriend in a fire at the location where the mall stands <br /> <br />. The owner of the mall will hire the intentional guard <br /> <br /> Responsible for the fire as a security guard after the end of the first security guard <br /> <br />. Rob Estes, ions before "Silk Stalkings", is a photographer photographer <br /> <br /> trying to find a story. He has a relationship with Cute Girl, their friendly friend "Pauly Shore", and tries to find out if Eric is still alive. He, lives in the basement of the mall (?) And travels <br /> <br /> through the air channels and angers the various people who angered his ex-girlfriend, including the burner. In the end, it is kidnapped <br /> <br /> The conclusion includes the bomb and everyone running from the scene <br /> <br /> before the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is about to ride <br /> <br /> as mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course, you probably did not need a schematic because the entire story is in the title. A person named Erik retaliates against people as a ghost of a mall. This also means there is no suspense. We know that Eric is behind this, but we still have to see. <br /> <br /> Estes & Quit-Girl learns about ridiculous investigation suggestions. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie Fairchild, whom we know was in cahoots with the owner <br /> <br /> the mall owner along, drag the gun on the heroic duo in the middle <br /> <br /> A crowded party , Yet no one says a word as she leads them to her office <br /> <br />, and her final death. The fictional city is huge, yet a police officer is still being called <br /> <br />, where everyone depends on the security of shopping centers for order. <br /> <br /> Eric has been hiding since building the mall, but I'm not sure where. He seems to live in the basement area, but you think some construction workers have found him. He also provided his own love board very well and found a few ports, because he had electricity. It might be nicer than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore lovers, both of you, noticed a note. Conquer the security guard <br /> <br /> from the booth by taking a look at the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, this is where you can see a grainy shot <br /> <br /> in black and white from the South Beach of Polly, although there is no wezil. <br /> <br /> This is undesirable and is a positive sign that I am hired to rent <br /> <br /> just about anything in the video store to stay in the horror section. This movie <br /> <br /> is not revenge for Eric, it is the filmmaker's revenge for me <br /> <br /> Being stupid enough to watch it. Here's the revenge: I do not recommend it. This will appear 'em! <br /> <br /> This (R) is classified as physical violence, some weapon violence, and gore, <br /> <br /> Some abusive words, some female nudity, brief male nudity, and some <br /> <br /> Sexual content.
