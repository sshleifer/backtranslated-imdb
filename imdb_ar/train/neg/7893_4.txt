At first, we began to see the beginning of a secret council of some kind. Everything seemed very promising to get going. With some supernatural elements, the puzzle becomes more exciting every minute. The main character, who looks like a good block, stumbles because of his demand for the money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. Sympathy with a man wants to know exactly what is going on. A person usually has several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this film, there seems to be only one solution, even if it is clear that it is not his fault. From Blue faces characters talking about the church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to his problem. It must be clear at some point in the film what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this letter. Because it is always useful. But it was really necessary to hide this message. This religious component has already destroyed the viewing experience for me. Although the message is good, simplicity can not avoid the fact that in fact more should be done to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery offered to us is not solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic unrelated to the scheme. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. The illustrious actor in a day is enough, but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise what could be a representative of his caliber to work in a film like this.
