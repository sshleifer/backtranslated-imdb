Diana Moldor appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seemed to notice - it was probably hair. Regardless, this time she is not the pot of God (see previous episode) but she is a very famous lady with magical powers that enables her to communicate and see Medusan without being mad (standard humanitarian response). Unfortunately, the man most loved for her is a few cards lacking a whole set and trying to kill the Medus ambassador (who strangely lives in a small cage - this is a bad way to travel). Unfortunately, he did not injure himself. What happens next is kind of stupid and by the time I finished the episode for the first time I saw it, I was very relieved. Watching all the men on board going to Moldaur was rather silly, and Spock's representation when he became mad for a short time was very difficult. If you have not seen the offer before, choose a different ring.
