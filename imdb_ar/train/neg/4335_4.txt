The film and acting are not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job of playing Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that it is supposed to be a great film for a successful film. It is clear that the makers of this package did not see the original Carlito method or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is an intro package which means that the original film has already put some history to us and must end this film where the original film starts or at least performs it. None of the old friends of Carletto originally appeared in this film, so they were not mentioned. Louis Guzman, Pachanga's origin, is in the film but plays a completely different character. The original copies are made in 1975 and the package is conducted from 1969 to 1970. Given that this film happens less than 5 years ago, do not you think that one of Carlito's friends will long be shown? Originally, Carlito start is released from prison after serving five years in prison. This is just a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Sub-spoiler *** We know from the original start, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when Brikwell gives us a happy ending this Hollywood it is an insult to the original lovers' intelligence. What happens to a generation? It was the lack of continuity that made this film go straight to the video version.
