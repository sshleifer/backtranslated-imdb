The brides die on the altar and their bodies disappear. No one knows the reason or who, but the reporter of the investigation (Luana Walters) indicates that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and goes to interview her originator, Dr. Lorenz (Bella Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a crazy scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his old wife (Elizabeth Russell) with young bridesmaids to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting hypothesis and a running time is short enough that he should not be able to get boring. Unfortunately, although they start well, they begin to drag before the middle of the road and become rather boring with cliches and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about them - Bela Lugosi is an evil witch and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, fluffy, inscrutable and very frightening countess; I am always a lover of Angelo Roseto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It maintains an atmosphere of Gothic and its proper collections. <br /> <br /> But overall, you could not keep my interest in the whole picture, so I have to set it up badly.
