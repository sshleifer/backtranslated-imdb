Somewhere in his book DANSE MACABRE, Steven King suggests that one of the secrets of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers precisely about anything terrible waiting behind the door to get it. If the door is finally open and a 10-foot insect is caught, the reader may be a bit scared, but he'll also think, "Well, I can handle it. There is nothing more frightening than what lurks, invisible and unknown, on the other side of that tightly enclosed door, waiting to get you. <br /> <br /> The belief is so misunderstood that Jean-de-Boen more or less starts the film with a metaphorical film, opens the door himself and yells, "Look, everyone, see! It's a 10-foot error! ?! " The law of diminishing returns begins immediately. At the end of the film, the director, so to speak, jumps up and down, bangs in CGI pots and his bowl madly, and yells bluntly: "Look, everybody, look! Ten long bug bugs ... Now, here comes the hundred thousand tall bugs!" <br /> <br /> It is clear that filmmakers believe that special effects alone can compensate for all other shortcomings in this endeavor (and there are many). They can not and do not. In fact, the special effects are as impressive and impressive as they are, so much so that the distracted viewer stares at him - either admiring or disturbing - rather than indulging in the story. <br /> <br /> For me, Nadir comes to the absolute stupidity of this film when he tries a statue, "blood" flows out of his mouth, to sink Liam Neeson (like Dr. Marrow) into a fountain. It is clear that the filmmakers did not know what to do with this alleged idea once they got it, so they just crush Neeson in the water a bit, they flutter his arms and fail to shine. By the next scene, it seems that the good doctor has dried himself, and forget, everything, about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel appears to have been overlooked in this funny scenario by a panel of stone-challenged teenagers with low IQ who thought the method of intimidating people was to make every effect louder and louder: "Well, then, Let us, ah, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, wah, land on it ... and all these thorny things, for example, hold them in bed. "<br /> <br /> The only grace that lies in Healing is that it has finally become so horrendous that it is really funny. While Owen Wilson (as Luke Locke Sanderson) fell to the ground and then went on a magical death journey, I died about to fall to the ground, and I laughed. <br /> <br /> Constructed badly, incredibly strangely, unbelievably, full of high-powered dialogue and useless scenes, this hidden haunted is a written example of how a horror movie is not produced.
