Yes, talk about bad consequences. Rick Moranis starred in this horrible third sequel titled "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". This concept essentially plays the same way as the first film, but with adults shrinking instead of shrinking children and the inner house instead of the universe park to explore it. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The film is dull at best, awkward at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the serial continuity was completely down the toilet. The only remaining actor for the first film is Rick Moranis. The actress who plays his wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, and the actors who play the neighbors have changed ... her Highness. They try to make us think that this is the same family, but the results are a bit puzzling. <br /> <br /> Second, the story is a reworking of the first, with little authenticity. All the few jokes (almost none of them) and dangerous situations that are shown in the film are copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I'm sure this was done with a smaller budget, but it's pathetic, much worse than the ones that appear in the rest of the series. You should like these small numbers that explore the huge local area, but you're likely to end up mostly most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem, locating the procedure inside the house is just boredom. Only a few things occur, and when they occur, they are not exciting at all. The first film was amusing because the children were dealing with the nature, the grass and the mistakes in which they lived. In this game, adults (somewhat boring compared to children) deal with dust, cockroaches and cockroaches. disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​releasing such a sequential sequel to the chain of dying was really attracted to Disney executives, except perhaps because they needed to take advantage of it without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: Leave this tasteless garbage in the place where you should stay: Get the dust on the store shelves.
