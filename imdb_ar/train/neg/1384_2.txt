Jet Li, is one of the best hand to hand over fighters in the world. I have been for over 20 years and put others in this kind of shame. While it is great in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the United States. <br /> <br /> The black mask is supposed to be a great movie for him, but it failed terribly. First of all, they are called. Although it may have value in the campground (dubbing is not as close as it is flat in tone), it only seems unsuitable for ordinary movie scenes. Second, the director in this film, Daniel Lee, does a terrible job. The viewer cuts off very quickly, sometimes, not knowing what is going on. Other times, the camera vibrates and oscillates. Fans see Jet Li's wonderful martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so quickly that they do not even know who is half the time! At other times, the scene is left hanging (ie, Li is starting to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the bad guys are arming their weapons, two seconds later, Li and the love love are already under the car!) Other scenes are unlikely, They express a completely ironic point (built-in CD-ROM killer? Just give it "throwing stars !!!!"). To me, the director needs a less prone to cutting machine guns and more to create a cinematic scene. Rap / Techno moves from being okay to intrusive. The plot contains possibilities but is all dispelled by cartoon characters that rule out any credibility sought by this film. Do we really believe that the interest of love will not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask? Do not give him hair or lower jaw or sound? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Jet Li, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple. This disorganized mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
