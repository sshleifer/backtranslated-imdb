My thoughts in the film, 9 <br /> <br /> were not good, and were not good at all. Visually, it was wonderful. I was pleased with the speed and corners of the camera and so on. Ah, kinda cute. Plot? I sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie looked like the folly of a new era more than anything else. Organized debt is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not better portrayed. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... But "souls" have the ability to destroy monsters and save life? Oh really? <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI film ... created with science ... and they use it to provide us with the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the sense of being asked by one of the characters. <br /> <br /> "Well, then what next?" (Or something like that). I could not hear it well because the crowds immediately woke up and a break out. It was "well ... it was just entertaining enough to sit here for the whole movie but now let's get out of here as soon as possible!" Type out. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can not think about if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the pictures and nod your head beautifully. No thinking, "What's the point?" It will absorb you from infidelity and make you watch the sign out eagerly. <br /> <br /> Well ... follow the spoilers. <br /> <br /> So, basically, the world creates the "machine" capable of creating another intelligent life. Evil beings use it as a weapon. However, the world realizes that it is also wrong. The machine gave his intelligence, but he did not give it his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine puts Skynet on the collective ass of humanity and erases all life on Earth, and finally collapses slowly. However, the world managed to survive and create walking sock dolls. Each one, contains a piece of the spirit of the world. <br /> <br /> The last one, number 9 wakes up from not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. Meet with someone else like him, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 was picked up by another robot from the machine. # 9 finds more like himself and sets off to save # 2. <br /> <br /> They have succeeded. <br /> <br /> # 9 Note that a matching hole fits the device perfectly. He has inserted it and returned the device to life ... and pulled spirit # 2 into the process. <br /> <br /> Then the film continues with the scenes of the movement with number 9 in an attempt to save its exhausted citizens. <br /> <br /> They finally succeeded in destroying the machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who climb into the clouds. Then the rain falls and we see life returning to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hanah?!? <br /> <br /> This is meaningless. nothing at all. Why did Heck wanted the world to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? what did you do? Have you been created to turn off the device? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? <br /> <br /> Why do you expect nine small creatures to succeed when nothing else works? Why not make a second machine, but with a "spirit" to fight the first .. At least it seemed as if it would have a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they do this by sucking their lives into the machine by the machine, then destroying the machine and then liberating the lives in order to bring life back to earth? Why not wait until the machine stops working and returns life without all the other crazy steps?
