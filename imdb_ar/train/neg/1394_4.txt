The "brain machine" will put your mind at least in an intense attempt to find out what is going on around it. Four different subjects were chosen backgrounds and level of intelligence for an experiment described by one researcher as a scientific study of man and the environment. Since the only common denominator between them is the fact that not every family is known, it will not be neglected - none of them will be missed. <br /> <br /> The whole problem is overseen by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but seems to be taking his guidance from a senator who wants to remain anonymous. A good call there by the senator. There is also a mysterious shield that the camera constantly magnifies, which later claims that it does not take its direction from the general or "project". It was so bad that it was not more effective, it easily beat it before everything went to kablooey. <br /> <br /> If there is nothing else, the film is a real treasure of the 1970s techniques showing frequent footage from phone phones, room-sized computers and a teletype will not stop. Perhaps this is the basis of the alternative title of the film - "Time Warp"; nothing else would have any meaning. For me, I would like to think about the title proposed by Dr Krisner's "Project on Collective Stress". This applies to film actors and viewers alike. <br /> <br /> Look at the head of the general at the pool when a customer asks for his weapon. The microphone hangs over his head for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to catch this one if you're a hard-loving Gerald MacKarney. Could it have been a young man? James Best also appears in a somewhat unusual role as a hidden man, but not as the father. For something a little more in the slug, try to put your hands on "The Killer Shrews" in 1959. This at least does not pretend to take itself seriously.
