In fact, Mark Blitzstein's assignment outside "Broadway" to "Three Penny" was not "as well" as generally believed. My father was part of the first full-scale production in the United States; the U-Illinois Theater Guild did so at the end of World War II, and HJitler was almost successful in suppressing the play so much They were forced to reconstruct the script and register from two different bilingual registrations (not English), the German novice text and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not "translation" - which was fully approved by Lotte Lenya - was closer to origin than was generally thought. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know is the MGM cast (recently available on Polygram on a CD) (including Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, "The Big Big Girl"), and I can not see her hands on her hips The shoulders were thrown back on this line - Pia was a big babe at 50, Paul Paul and John Astin was watched extensively by Mike Curb, head of the MGM records - I mean, 17 (I think they were) "Goddamn" was cut to "curse" only . (At one time, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the play * in full *, no doubt as highly controlled.)
