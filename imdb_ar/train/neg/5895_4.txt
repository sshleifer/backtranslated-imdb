Does Miike like Chabrol, alternating with Art Dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does it match fifty-five in the Chabrol claim? Do you see here very much or very little Miike? I do not know, I do not know. I do not know, I do not know. I do not know, I do not know. But I could easily fill in just ten lines, citing one Missed Call's, hints, and clich√©s. Others will beat here mostly, although Saimin (hypnosis) of Ochiai's (hypnosis) due to the ludicrous television broadcasts makes fun of supernatural objects. Only once, when Yumi took the mom that looked like a zombie in her arms, one Missed Call surprised me a bit. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (like Christopher Walken) as an investigator. Ishibashi in the story of the offensive Audition, as Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki from the sinking of the feces and others, may be the most wickedly evocative actor ever. So here is a cop.
