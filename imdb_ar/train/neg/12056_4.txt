This movie is a good example of how you can manipulate media by selling a movie that is just a very unfamiliar television series. In Puerto Rico, the daily newspaper, which is widely distributed on the masterpieces of this film, has almost disappeared. Coincidentally, the newspaper with its second largest distribution belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the format and content of the film, and explained all the flaws, cliches and bad writings. <br /> <br /> Just because the film makes part of the audience laugh with easy and clear jokes, and because actors and landscapes can be recognized, it does not make it an acceptable film.
