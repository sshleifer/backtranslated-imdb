The moment you make a "technical film" 1/10, you have people struggling to get your blood ignorant, mentally retarded, and technically backward. I will not try to explain how I am not aesthetically handicapped by listing all the "artistic cinemas" that liked me or mentioned how I was given some "cult classic" not known 10/10. All I ask is for someone to explain to me the purpose, purpose and message of this film. <br /> <br /> Here's how I can summarize the film: Open a montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting ridiculous levels of falling participation. The following - a child game host trying to die of lung cancer - corrects things with his daughter who is addicted to coke, who may have raped or not raped her when he was a child, and is dealt with by a manipulative police officer In relationship issues, while the contestant decides to star in the game show that he does not want to be the miracle of a failed child, a fate occurred in the last show of the contestants of the sixties, which we see now, unemployed gays love a supportive waiter and need money for "Corrective Oral Surgery", while asking for a game display product, which He died of lung cancer, his male nurse was helping to peck with the son he had abandoned for years, who later became a female self-help counselor, although his second wife's wife suffered from guilt for deceiving a dying man; and, Rainy frogs (read correctly). I miss you for the long, incredible and senseless monologues that every character seems to fly quickly for no other reason or reason, perhaps, to make sure that the film is interspersed with 3 hours and classify it as a "modern epic" You might think that I could have done a better job of summarizing the film (rather than confusing you) if you had written a little coherent thing, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one ... well, you now know what I feel.
