This promoter was Tim's first acting role in the film? The character, Leon, was funny enough but soon after, sexual jokes and humor became so stupid that it was hard to hear. Some movies can escape sexual jokes and build their audiences to find out correctly when they are advertised. Some of the films that do this are American Pie and Scary Movie. The film was scary, stupid, and the American pie was not working well without sex jokes. The only role, besides Leon, who had some of the humor that ensued is Veril. The character was really dumb and that was all, stupid humor was all that made me watch. The film was fine, nothing else. I do not really understand why people always get snl who die in order to leave the show on a movie that depends on the character they played in the show. The sitcom lasts about 5 minutes, and if they can produce a 5-minute comedy, what will the world come to? Molly Shannon had the star, Sherry Otteri was a scary film, but she was not a pioneer, and would be a dwarf. But that was good, but he did some stupid movies, but I can not remember, and Mike Myers with Wayne's world. How do not the crazy TV crew get movie shows? Watch only one man penetrating, but just like in 2 movies and a TV show with Andy Dick. But this guy depends on the comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. This film is not good, but it has some positive humor. What a waste of film and money people. (D-D)
