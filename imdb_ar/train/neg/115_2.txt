Never cast models and playboy rabbits in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" is about Dorothy Starten, who was so obsessed with Bogdanovic that she married her sister after being killed by her low-life husband, more thrilling than the billions of times Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patti Hansen is not a actress either. I was expecting to see some kind of lost masterpiece in the film "No Orson Welles", but instead I got Audrey Hepburn wearing jeans and a nice "Podlask" hair messenger. "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I can see it over and over again. This clunker I barely sit through once. This film was not released because of the muddle surrounding Mrs. Straten's death. I guess the real reason was because it was so bad!
