It could have been a very good film, if I could see it. The hand held the camera was very bouncy. From the opening credits I was worried. Many of us felt nauseated in the end. But we stayed to the end because it was a fascinating and interesting film, giving an idea of ​​the popular culture of young people in South Africa. Black and white film did not enhance the shrewd sense of it. The acting looked very authentic. It was difficult to understand some of the dialogue, but it seems that the theater full of Africans other than South Africa finds it more funny. If you have motion sickness at all, you might seriously consider skipping this movie. It's strange, but not worth the nausea.
