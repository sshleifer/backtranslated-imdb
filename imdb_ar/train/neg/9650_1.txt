Maan, where to start this terrible film. Bad bad bad story. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this film. Namaste London was a very enjoyable film to be frank ... so the soundtrack was good. But in this one..this is good ... for the film is supposed to be musical .. the songs are very bad. AR should have been music manager. <br /> <br /> Looking at great actors, it would have been better for the manager to do a lot better. Although the first half sucks, only the last 30 minutes of the film is fine. The performances of Salman and Ajay save the film from being a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you do not have something better to do. The last good Bollywood movie I've seen (and I see a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
