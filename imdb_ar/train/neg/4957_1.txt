I can not believe some people actually like this. After still calling themselves fans Batman. So go so far as to say that it is better than BTAS. It is not. It must be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of crap. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The full premise of the show is "if you can not beat someone by getting a bigger weapon to help you." Batman is not about weapons. He uses his batarang and hooker wrestling and Batmobile, that's it. He does not find a new skillful technique every time he can not beat someone. I do not know where the hell they got an idea for Patbott. Or whatever. They destroyed all the bad guys. Mr. Freese has moved from a sympathetic world to a petty criminal caught in a state of freezing. The Cat Woman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman carrying a stupid costume. The penguin is now a ninja with a 50-foot hat. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes the doll the focus of the whole personality. They even got a stupid idea to make it gigantic! WTF? The worst changes are The Joker and Riddler. They have mysteriously changed to a gothic / retro-crazed teenager. Joker to the tumbler with horror. He looks like Bob Marley wannabe. Batman has completely and completely destroyed even Morizo ​​of B & R! I hope to meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so that I can hit them in the head with a baseball bat.
