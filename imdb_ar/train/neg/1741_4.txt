The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo was golden by the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the movie (Double Indian) with great hopes, especially after boredom. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before him, this movie was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which was already old, can only be extended without further development or layers. After a while, you just want to finish the movie so you can go home (if you watch this at home, it would have been much easier to reduce my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best, and John Abraham should not try to do comedy again. The comedy aspects of the film were a nice week. I just remember laughing like the entire movie's weakness. Certainly do not laugh a side belly that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even less in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Parish Rawal was a bit of his expected classic moments, but overall, since his role and personality did not give much room for growth, he had little impact in this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dubya, who appeared only in the film, was fun to watch while she was on screen. And some fun songs. Special opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you're better off just passing this movie.
