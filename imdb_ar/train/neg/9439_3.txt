The twist ends can be really wonderful in a movie. It is particularly interesting when the torsion is in front of our eyes, but we do not pay attention. This type of twist endings are the ones that make people think. Then we have the twists like this film has. Transformations, whether you are interested or not, have no idea what will happen. When they detect this kind of random misrepresentation, rather than shock, this reaction is somewhat feeble. This film begins as if it would be an interesting film in a state of terror, but after about 20 minutes, it will be nothing but a boring dialogue and a stupid development. <br /> <br /> Three young women will participate in a concert, so travel through the jungle is lost, and hit a tree trunk. They end up in the house of a creepy old lady who hates men and is greeted by her close daughter Marion (Laurel Monson). Strange events occur as these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or go home, and the thrill develops into a slippery slant. <br /> <br /> This movie is very stuck in his dialogue, and it is always among a few characters. We have three girls primate, creeping spinster and old lady, and conversation of any importance does not exceed these five. To make matters worse, they have nothing interesting to say. It is actually very sad sitting through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> There are plenty of plot holes here. It seems that the house where these girls are staying when they get into their car accident is three miles from anywhere ... Wow, three miles! Two hours or less will walk kill them. Why did not they ride with this family that was driving to the city? Did he have one seat? How do you never ask these girls to leave and stay willingly, rarely checking each other? Why should this have a lot of stupid transformations? The answers may be in the boring text. <br /> <br /> Having a five-letter italic is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the result is definitely there, but it is without a doubt. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 79 minutes. R on nudity and violence.
