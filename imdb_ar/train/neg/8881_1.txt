The personal representation is a bit harsh, as if it were the first time a man showed up on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (played multiple roles on television, such as Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and then can miss her representation significantly. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, as portrayed by Clive Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this film with his body language for most of the time. It does not do a bad job, but it is a little too much to ask a representative to connect the empty spaces of the ocean where characters spend their time not talking and acting. Perhaps the most prominent role of Robertson is Ben Barker in the last 3 Spider Man films (Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. Husband kills his rich wife because of her money. Afterward, it seems that the wife is going back and chasing the husband and he leads him madly until he jumps out of a high window (fearing the ghost of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is expected to die. <br /> <br /> The second driver employed by Mr. Ballard is very similar to the English Hamel mark. Really weird! The only thing that stands out is total disregard for dialogue. A few minutes pass quietly, no one speaks, and little does. It is shameful that the MST3K men did not get this movie. It could have been much better, if not predictable, with more dialogue, or shorter scenes than "nothingness". <br /> <br /> I kept expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadow and announced that he was working for "nothing" that housed this film.
