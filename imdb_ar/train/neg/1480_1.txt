Pull the courage men out his butt! This spoof is not it? No one really writes that this happens just like improvising the terrible error. I think in no way. This film must be a parody because those who say they wrote this text in another way. Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting while the director and the writer move to the painting. <br /> <br /> The director then says: "Then the villager who is born in his area uses a 24-inch welder to clear our fearsome neighbor, and he will pull the courage out of the hole." <br /> <br /> " entire. <br /> <br /> That can not happen, no one writes that stupid! It must be a parody. <br /> <br /> I loved the part in which the thin galactic intruder overcame the fancy of the marriage of relatives to death through the cast iron fry found on the floor of the cave. I was not sure of the innate cannibals bothering to cook a lot. Perhaps this explains why the pan was lying on the ground in the dark at just the right time to kill the mutilated structure. It seems ironic that after the horrendous man beat the queens of a martial arts specialist and two young men of the type of doors, he easily falls into a slender girl's skillet in the vicinity. <br /> <br /> What is Richard Greco doing in this? Was his agent launched or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the ending to me please because I did not get it too? I can not determine why the cute little girl wanted to kill the ridiculous lady who made some tea from her. I do not care do not want to know.
