Melodrama's puzzlement is taken from the William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincent Menelli! Richard Widmark has a fine rural atmosphere, with his loose wife fighting with the self-appointed queen of bees Lilian Gish. Widmark confronts the evil eye of the newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is reuniting with her husband and child. Tyrannical and chaotic, located in a random place and time, with the love story "David and Lisa" hidden in a plush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this text gives them nothing to build on. For an hour or so, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the hanging curtains in the library (this thread is not used as a symbol; it is a red hanger in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the great differences that people encounter when they work in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately, the ring road revealed by Minelli about this soup is not rich in useful information. ** from ****
