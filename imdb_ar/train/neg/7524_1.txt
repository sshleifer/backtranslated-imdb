A group of critics gave this film positive comments. I do not want to argue with them, but I disagree strongly. When I first saw this film, I was mildly impressed. But after comparing them to other films, especially with the late professor Bruce Lee, I changed my mind quickly. In fact, if it is not the title of the film, I never bought it. Game of Death 2 is not related to the original game of Death, except that it shares one character, Billy Lo. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to learn how the game of Death 2 was compared to the Enter the Dragon. The conspiracies have striking similarities: Bruce Lee and Bobby Lowe are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two sites are similar, both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of black belt. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent to the guest rooms in both films.) Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Louisis henchman have a missing hand. They are an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, and the director has used his imagination and given Lewis a pet monkey! Menu still exists. <br /> <br /> As for other aspects of the film, such as text and acting, I felt it was so bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to attend their role in the film and arrive to be able to act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography design is impressive. Although the sequence of fighting contains powerful elements of acrobatics in them, they are not less skillfully performing. However, since the plot is not enough, I could not relate to the characters, so the sequence of the fighting was more of an exhibition than a meaning for the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that this film is recommended for any martial arts enthusiast, but for those who enjoy a strong action film with a good story and strong characters, I do not seriously recommend this film. My views on this film may seem very biased and unilaterally, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, especially after the "Enter the Dragon" masterpiece, this film failed to live up to these standards. If anything they imitated the truly brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> With reference to my evaluation, this film was awarded a very cruel out of 10, the film is barley and must be grateful because it had its combat sequences.
