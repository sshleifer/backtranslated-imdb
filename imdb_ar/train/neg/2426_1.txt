Trust me, this is a movie we have abandoned and you want to avoid and come from the fan of the huge Washington Denzel. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a wonderful movie. The first part of this film does an exceptional job in preparing characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl who paid for her protection. All trailers for this film remember that they were kidnapped. So, I do not give anything away when I say that the film turns into an almost insurmountable mess after being kidnapped. Whatever the manager tried to accomplish, all he could do was make the audience literally angry. Track fast, hectic and volatile reductions for the next half hour while Crissy tracks the culprits. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is take you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story showed a change in Krissy's character and showed that a different film would have been followed. Well, I've been right. The film he read was complete and unsatisfactory. The result is a frustrating ending that destroys even the first forty minute quality of the film.
