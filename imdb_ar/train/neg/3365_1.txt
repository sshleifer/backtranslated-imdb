This 1963 bad remake of classic starts well, then replaces the thrill with its own muddled and futile effects. For example, originally, one of the most chilling moments when Neil and Theo are going side by side in a double bed, listening in horror to the noise outside their room. Neil asks Theo to leave her hand because she is hurting her. Neil then looks at Theo, who is several meters away and realizes that Theo was not holding her hand. In the latest version, Neil lies alone in bed when she suddenly dips and slides across the earth. Only when you tell the unseen force to stop pulling it out do you realize what happened. Can anyone explain what Neil's final words mean - "It's about family, it's always about family"? <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature is Lily Taylor's performance, but even this can not save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again demonstrates that her exterior has little depth. Originally, Claire Bloom suggested skillfully persuading her lesbian. However, Zeta Jones should explain this, for example, by asking Neal if she has a girlfriend or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Certainly, they must be sent to the cemetery to re-make useless things behind them.
