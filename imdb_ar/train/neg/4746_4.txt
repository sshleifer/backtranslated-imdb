There are many wrong things with the character film Brenda Song as one of them. I do not think the girl is a bad actress - I honestly do not. I think they were given poor lines. It's supposed to be, "That girl is absent, expensive", and although she's funny in the TV shows she plays, she can not even laugh at me here. <br /> <br /> Either way, I really had to know what I was expecting when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so bad ... at first. Wendy's reaction to Sean was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be an incarnate monk, pursued you by wearing a medal and insisting that you needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world? Which leads me to another point. I know that this film is quite fantastic, but it is still rooted in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in the Wendy family line were women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt that the monks were so good at this. Sure, they could have worked in some way, but they gave no explanation at all. By doing so, they have only contributed to many of Hollywood's lobbying efforts and the media to empower women. <br /> <br /> However, let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film continues. Yes, she is a teenager, and she is about to return home - I mean who wants to fight evil while returning home? The problem is that when "evil" begins to show itself, Wendy does not seem as appalled as he should be. She is very careless - even for someone like her. She does not care about her training. I will use this conversation as an example: "If you do not win this battle, evil will do everything, and everything will go well." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about the pressure ... well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's Wendy. Let's also go dancing when you really must be in training. Of course Xin allows her, but his character has an excuse. It is better to cooperate with them, rather than not cooperate with them, and they do not train at all, and kill them. <br /> <br /> Oh, I'm talking about it. She also told Sean Wendy that his fate was to die for her in battle, as he did with her grand grandmother (I suppose this part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's behavior more ambiguous. As the screenwriter would get, Wendy returns home and this "great battle" on exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she eventually goes to battle, because when she tries to leave to return home, the monks (trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she "felt strangely fighting an old man") told her that she had launched the battle on her own, so she went to save him. <br /> <br /> We've seen some inappropriate battles at first, and that's really fun. To the end, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival body to return home, creating a real embodiment of himself from the broken parts of the veterans' bodies. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets a "panic". Then Shen goes and defends this man, forgives me to forget his long Chinese name, and manages to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Wendy grabs Shane and makes a long descent from uncomfortably rising into the air. <br /> <br /> She screams at the title of the article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough to become Wendy too strong and too far away. No, I will not allow her to be apologetic because she was "doomed" and had "power within her." <br /> <br /> Since when, though, have you learned healing? No, the worst ... How long can it revive people? So Shen rose from the dead. Then, Wendy is fighting the man. <br /> <br /> He lost the road easily. Worst of all, is when they jump together and kick at the same time, and deny forever. The monks then praise Wendy for her sacrifices. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Do not the scriptwriter and director know that the battle needs a bit more "ingenuity"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she did not go home? Because the girl did not break sweat, or even bleed. I mean, come on now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... goes on. <br /> <br /> I know it looks like I should have given the film a single film, based on my comments. Part of the criticism, you should know, though it breaks something. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad, but if there is, you draw attention to it. This movie is very bad, but something funny happens when you never expect to have something great in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I thought it was fine. I'm not saying that it was not all that well for it would have prevented anyone from watching it.
