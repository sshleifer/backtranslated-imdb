I hope this film is moderately amusing, like other species of this genre. However, it was lame and I did not find myself laughing too much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you've got a free rental you get lost and need a movie to spend time. But I do not recommend paying for it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and direct, and may be funny, perhaps, if the script is better. Jason can be my joy, he laughs here and there, but the film falls. Just do not go to see this one. The directive is weak, but for the command, the routing is not that important. I think the main disadvantage is that it is not very funny. Seeing something else, do not waste your time here.
