One of Frances Farmer's oldest films, at the age of 22, is quite beautiful. Bing Crosby is a great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Ray and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, which may have been wonderful in its time, is now tight. Roy Rogers also appears in a musical role. From my point of view, it is not worth watching unless you are a fan of Francis Farmer and possibly of Bing Crosby.
