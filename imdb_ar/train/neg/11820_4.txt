I've seen this on a DVD (known as CORRUPT in this format) and the harsh noise in the cover has caused how the character of Harvey Keitel Frank is very much like the character BAD LIEUTENANT played in the film "This Brilliant Police Story." What the cover did not mention is that this is an old Italian film. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays the music it does not put on the CD player, it pulls out a large piece of plastic pie and places it in a kind of rotary kiln where a type of mechanical arm touches the pie, which leads to music. You see my view on this old film? The DVD case did not present any evidence that the film was produced 20 years ago. It is also a film with weak production values ​​like many other Italian films that masquerade as American films. Except the Keitel the Cast is awful Although Johnny Rotten's performance is very bad and not terrible, filming is consistent with image and sound quality, giving the impression that I was watching a 4th generation pirate version (I do not know if it comes back to an interconnected DVD or if Printed for a very bad film) and worst of all is the result of Ennio Morricone. It is impossible to believe that the man who made disturbing disturbing music to CORRUPT was the same who did music to those Westerners from Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> All of this is unfortunate because CORRUPT has moments that are by no means the greatest psychological excitement ever created, but they have been my concern, and as always, Keitel is performing well as a violent nutcase cop. It is unfortunate that the rest of the film did not conform to its high standards
