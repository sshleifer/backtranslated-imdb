It sounds like one of those movies we think we love, but I did not like them. He seems to be trying to be "technically" in a very difficult way. Each flash, with no content. It has some beautiful scenes, and any of them are beautiful to watch, but take them all together and become a daunting task just to sit in. I hired this because of the incandescent comments on the video cartons, and the fact that I was a great Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I found it just tasteless, and sometimes boring.
