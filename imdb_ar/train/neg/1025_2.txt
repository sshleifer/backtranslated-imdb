That is the only question left to me. Why did this film suck so much when he had such a great cast? Why was the writing so bad, I left the audience totally unrelated to the characters? Why did it make no sense at all? Why did the studio take a very good premise and Hollywood "hell" of it when it had everything it needed and a good story story? why? I never understand why movies that start well turn into a heap of waste by the time they are released. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who won the Oscar, not to launch on big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As a person holding a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is completely funny. I just ... I think the script was possible, but the implementation around it was cliche, and another awful in it. Just. No.
