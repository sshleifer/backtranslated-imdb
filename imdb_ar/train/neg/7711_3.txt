The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where it was in the brain. <br /> <br /> The "attack" is basically a parody of "the plane" (two years ago - the good truth) of what happens when a vegetable attack, or in this case fruit. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of movie magic (motionless, maki tomatoes, paper on skates, reverse imaging, people watching the on-screen tomatoes, people who throw basketball-sized tomatoes at actors who appear On the screen), tomatoes are already attacking everyone at their fingertips. <br /> <br /> After that, it comes back to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I did not wish by any government to save the day. Of course, there is an intervening reporter (Taylor) emerging in the worst of times, dancing and singing army soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, some wandering around the canopy and sword samurai ... Oh yeah, San Diego Chicken before it is great. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not fantastic. In fact, you can probably compensate yourself better after seeing these. Some dialogue is very bad ("please pass ketchup" - nothing can be said in front of tomatoes). As far as "Puberty Love" goes ... well, I can not blame the tomatoes in grumbling hear it. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I liked the special song and the beginning of the credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at one time it was well executed. This is about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a comedy "killer", but he tries. <br /> <br /> Rock, peace.
