I can not believe I've already sat through everything. This film has its worst representation since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief summary of the plot: The film begins with Jojo and the other chick sits on the beach, wailing on a light blond beach "big piece" it seems he did not go to the gym daily in his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every chick in the film wants him. Oh oh! Here comes the competition! "Hot Chick" molded molded and best friends who drive an ugly pink car. We soon discovered that Jojo had a lifetime job in Australia, meaning that Jojo had to leave and leave her best friend behind her (no, I think I would cry). A huge storm comes, and the pool fills with foul water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool and faces face to face, yes, I guessed it, MERMAID! This is where the "story" really goes. Basically, they want to make the mermaid fall in love with the "big piece". <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful pattern with very bad representation, it makes the 1980s look like the top of the Oscar-winning shows. This movie contains all the clich√©s possible ... best friends, "big piece" that everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her annoying friends, the scary old man ... she named it, it's there. I took one for many people by watching this. Consider my watch and 40 minutes sacrifice you. Please, do not see this movie. Do not let him suffer in vain.
