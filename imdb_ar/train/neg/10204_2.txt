At first, the film looked fantastic, they had a collection of character profiles ... The plot seemed to be going in the right direction ... However, as the film progressed, the director seemed to focus on the wrong kind of things. .. or just a lot of movie was edited. The identities of the characters changed to the worst in the film. Also, there seems to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they have things inside the film that do not seem to fit the film itself. AND THE title ... There is no place in the film where the title fits the film ... I suppose the title works for previews ... Good actors with what they have ..... If they have a better director and writer, Best. But she did not. And now, there is a new awesome movie that will be released this Friday .... My opinion ... Do not waste your time or money.
