What happens when you give a free man enough money just to trap him in the rat race and watch him wince? Homeless people answer anyone. They do not have mortgages or rent payments or stupid heads. Homeless people do not need to worry about the IRS, performance reviews, or credit card payments. But, give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly, they have to worry about entering the rat race, buy gas for transport, pay insurance on their cars, work with someone else. They have a chance to be "productive citizens". This film was about as exploitative as the film could be. It's a way for the rich middle class shepherd to say, "See what happens when you try to help the poor?" It proves capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why does not the film ask "What happens when you rob everything a rich man owns?"
