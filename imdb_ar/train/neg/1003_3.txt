Well, I'm not a Japanese. I know little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Otherwise, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I love black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with this specific point, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how the Japanese audience enjoys it. Mamoru Oshii is a very good director - despite the extraordinarily anomalous postmodernism in style Talking Head, and even that was curious and fairly enjoyable - and I'm surprised he got it. It may be just a case of lost translation, I'm afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the movie with a textual translation written in English into a subtext, I thought it was awful. The jokes seemed bad, the text was packed - I mean, give the audience a break, just a little narrator - to the point where my head bursts over an exaggeration of quick speech and silly movement. <br /> <br /> However, I think the animation was really fantastic. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye candy ends as soon as the letters are left aside to begin with no end, not funny at all in mumbo-jumbo's words on the still images. It just makes you want to progress quickly to the scene of the next hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is actually planning to supplement it. The idea was good but was terribly exploited. The second part may show the good parts of this first part and actually make an interesting film, or perhaps it will be more and more scenes narrated. But hell, if you think talking head was dense, Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment depends on the experiences of a European person. Perhaps this was completely useless to the Japanese people, perhaps it was a really funny film lost in cultural boundaries and translation. Can.
