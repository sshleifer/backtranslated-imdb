I'm actually aiming to see this movie in the theater. Already sold. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which was actually the worst film released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Ligisamo), a street chemist who is tough on the street, comes out when he sees a child He gets shot, so he decides to clean up and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going well until Jack Town goes over with his girlfriend Trish (Dennis Richards). This happened very late in the film, so if they did not reveal it in the preview, that would be an interesting development. But they did, so it is not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not one interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you watch even one preview, you have watched the whole movie, so you may just want to think hard to fill the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, and save yourself $ 3.99. There is no single surprise or evolution in the entire film, other than the horror of the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone who was responsible for writing the sound recording was fired. Twice. Much of it is what the music would be like if the only songs allowed were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (the fabric of the continuum of time and space was destroyed by the concept of the mind) was less talented and musical. <br /> <br /> Representation at best is poor, the text is at best a crime against humanity, and Dennis Richards at best 67% of Styrofoam and 33% of Kissblock. You know that things are bad when John Liguizmo (in The Pest!) Appears at the bottom of the cast with his acting abilities.
