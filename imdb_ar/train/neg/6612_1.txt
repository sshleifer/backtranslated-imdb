I downloaded this movie yesterday through a website that was of fairly good quality! I was watching the film with great expectations (although I knew it was a flop), especially since the film has Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of villain. Although at least representatives like him would have achieved some of the roles they deserved. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to influence as this villain proved that no one could compete with Amjad Khan's magical Rgv experience to rekindle the past in reverse! Cholay, the old teacher, is a landmark in Indian cinema with actors from all over the world, a cult dialogue, an elegant cinematography, and fantastic soundtrack that is still successful with current generations. A good actor like TALENTS from Ajay Devgan, wasted his performance and average.Prashant Raj, the newcomer does not know what acting. Nisha Kothari proved that she was one of the worst actresses we have, and I do not know how still in the crew of RGV Urmila & Abhishek who was seen in a song without any excitement and passion Mahanalal tried his best and the work of Susmitha Sen was good. The work in this film was the total massacre of the original Cholay
