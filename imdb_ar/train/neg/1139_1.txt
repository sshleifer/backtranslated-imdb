Please note that I have not seen the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my country is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm already doing a university research about the personality of the title Richard Morris Buck and I would like to point out that the person who made his main character was completely different !!! Hollywood ideas about people and technical license were granted, Dr. Buck real fully endorsed hysterectomy to treat madness in women, and never practiced anything liberal as described in the film. I think it's funny to see many film critics who write in the Islamic newspapers who say this film has a historical basis! The only real truth I can see is the friendship between Dr. Buck and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time in a movie ignoring this horror experienced by real women at the hands of this doctor who is glorified by the film industry now.
