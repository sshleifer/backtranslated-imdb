Absolute garbage, the worst fighting scenes from the 20-year-old van damme movie or the American ninja and so on. <br /> <br /> Truly a very difficult representation, not a skill in sight in the entire film, like a collection of wood carvings. <br /> <br /> Just watch it to see how bad this movie is, it may be acceptable in the 1980s, but this is a 2006 film. I do not have much love for this film because it was not born in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> If you like real combat movies, check out Tony Ga in Ong Buck and the Protector, these are martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Laughing and watching this day you may see unintended humor in a bleak range.
