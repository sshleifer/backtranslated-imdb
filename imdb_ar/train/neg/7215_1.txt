It was a stupid piece of crap. every thing is bad. Why do we love those who love Western movies nine times out of ten times when renting Westerners. It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth tinkering with. For the most part the main work of the Shiloh Falls was in 1892, but the pistols used were 1860s models. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, the Marshal set the fire on fire almost six times nine times and could not hit any of the three big men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this madness. Perhaps those who took part in the film had taken some lessons at Sun City Carson's acting school.
