W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be classic in English. If so, much of the movie version must be lost here. The attraction of Philip (Leslie Howard) to Mildred (Pitt Davis) is inexplicable to make the script seem like a recounting of the post-collapse relationship from a man's point of view. Being a family lawyer I heard many of these novels. The man portrays himself as noble and always true, and the woman is hell with no other purpose than to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> In fact, unless a person is ready to laugh at the social assumptions of the movie maker, this is an uncomfortable film to watch. Even Philip indulges Mildred when she has a child of unspecified paternity, but the real point comes when Philippe Mildred - angry and now of dubious mentality - allows the free run of his apartment, with predictable results. Beit Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not happen here. In fact, at the end of the film, it is very similar to the character of Baby Jane, who would have played it thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I notice how Howard's character always wears elegant clothes. He tells me that Philip longs for respect for the middle class. Such a person can not run from a woman with a Cockney cycle tone fast enough. Philip, for most of the film, was a student; such a person would have been believable had he been younger, and the bad guys seemed to explain the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student placement - an English language Raskolnikov, as he does. And balanced by allowing a little Mildred of magic.
