The main character of Lance Barton and the sky is killed before his time. When the sky recognizes the error that gives him the body of Mr. Wellington of the elderly and wealthy white. <br /> <br /> A black guy in the body of an old white man still behaving like a black guy might be funny if you see it done by an old white actor. I ended up reminding myself a few times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white man." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as intended: "illusion" is not well transferred love story is absolutely unbelievable. The fact that all you see is that Chris Rock plays the role of a young black man, because the old white man, who is supposed to be seen by everyone only in small scenes, presents a great challenge for viewers to "suspend disbelief."
