Woody Allen, when at his best, has one of the sharp pens around him. It can make a sharp note and wrap around the punch line like anyone else. However, when it is at its worst, its films can be foul-smelling. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this foul odor from Conquest to closure. Set is one of his most interesting ideas while. Four friends sit in a restaurant to discuss whether the essence of life is a comedy or a play. To help settle this argument, a man connects the beginning of the story and asks the other two men who argue (one comic playwright, the other dramatist) whether the story is comedy or tragedy. Then the two men continue the story and the film shows the stories they are weaving. Now, when I first heard about this film, it was my understanding that they were telling exactly the same story, genre (comedy or drama) changed only by your view of it. Now that would be interesting. However, the stories share only one major element and some side elements. They are completely different stories with major plot differences. The drama is strictly written and patriotic so that it can only really act as a self-parody. If this is the point, it has failed because these elements prevent the public from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is a story that has seen moments of success, but it is still short and fleeting. It is clear that Will Farrell will be the defender of Woody, but he could have played this character more credibly without adding stuttering and Woodies. Woody is the best in being Woody. When someone else tries, they do not play a character, they design a well-known actor. These kinds of things only lead to the audience getting out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies from the theater make me a little lighter than walking. This person made me wish I could get my money back.
