A terrible film as everyone said. What made me laugh was the appearance of the veil of Scott McNealy, where he was awarded a prize to one of the programmers killed in front of a wall of slogans SUN. McNealy is CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that identifies itself practically as Microsoft. It has been useful in filing anti-monopoly complaints against Microsoft. So, was it ridiculous enough to believe that this bad film would add fuel to that fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I see about SUN's participation, but it is clear that the makers of this film know Scott McNealy. Interesting puzzle.
