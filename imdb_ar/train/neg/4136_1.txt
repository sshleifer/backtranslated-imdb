I read reviews before I saw this film, and I did not believe them. I love nonsense movies and I expect this to be an average one. Not so. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like great ones. The film has a bad representation, a bad voice, a bad story confusing, a bad makeup - I was bored with me a lot. Even nudity was nonsense! Do they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did it. You can tell if you will like this movie or not in the first five minutes. If you want to get a good cheesy gory movie, watch Watch Avenger 4 toxic game or even in blood camps. Avoid this trash - I've seen it on TV and felt that I had separated from it, so do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
