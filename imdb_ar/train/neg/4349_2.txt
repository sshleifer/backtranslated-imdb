This awesome movie Carlitos Way (1993) is a wonderful movie. Goodgfellas are just one of the best crime movies to do. This movie should be considered closer to the STING part of Part2 or perhaps the speed of the region. Remember those gems! The only reason why this film is making use of the original cult. This film lacked everything, where De Palma, Pashino and Ben worked hard. There was no likable character and this is a mistake everyone is responsible for making. I hope you win RISE TO POWER in every RAZZIE, and you may invent some new categories to allow them to be a record holder. After watching S @ * T FEST, I sat and watched the original Carlitos way to get a bad taste from my mouth. After watching this, I hope that Bachanga will come and hit me from my misery.
