Horrible, just awful! My colleague in the old room was watching this junk, which drove me crazy. This book is one of my favorites and it is a shame that some people will never know what it really is because their first impressions are of such a diameter. They have changed a lot and it is barely recognizable. Which amazes me because the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough feed for entertainment in modern times. It's like a Lifetime movie that says "based on a real story" but it's completely fictional. There is nothing of passion or depth of the book, just the mindless melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
