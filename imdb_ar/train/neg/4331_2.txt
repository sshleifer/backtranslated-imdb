Soon after watching this movie, you will realize why it has not reached the theaters! This film is not worth the mark "prequel". Instead, this is a common Hollywood theme, shredding good movies previously using catastrophic packages, sequences, and so on. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie was bouncing everywhere like Ping Pong, and the evolution of character was absent. I seriously felt that I was watching comedy at some point in the film because acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop filming the film with his terrible acting. He makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this film is Jaclyn DeSantis, which looks excellent in this film and actually brought some pleasure from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Carlito's Way, I'd advise you not to see this. If you decide to watch it anyway, this film works as if it were separated from the original, because that's exactly what it did.
