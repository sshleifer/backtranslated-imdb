This film is based on John Vanity's novel. Can anyone tell me why? I see no reason at all to adapt this good book in this way. If you want to make a Hollywood movie with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek, how can you relate to Ask The Dust? - And if you want to turn this story into a movie, why would you want to turn it into a Hollywood melodramatic romantic production with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek? I do not understand it. <br /> <br /> The story has been badly adapted. If you have read the book and liked it, I'm sure you will not like what Town has done. . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you may find strange acting, acting and filming too little. But hope for the best. I really hope so much during this film. I really wanted to be good. But it gets worse, and it's that simple: Whether you're reading a fantasy novel or not, this is not a good film. Just another romantic production of melodramatic Hollywood along with bad acting, lack of structure - and of course - lots of Colin Farrells' shots of sheer shame. <br /> <br /> I can complain a lot about this film, but why waste time. I have seen him. Okay. I had to see him, because I loved the book so much and it was curious. I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for the lovely little Sherin Cole at the end of the movie. Sweet ... If he was worn all the time, I gave him 2/10.
