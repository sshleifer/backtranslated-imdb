Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers", as is known here in the UK, was a horror film about an old man who was bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious poisonous plants !!!! The man rushed to the hospital, where this worm emerges like a creature from his mouth, and this of course turns into this insect monster and continues to ferment !! Despite the presence of Steve Ralsback and John Vernon in the film, I found it boring, with a predictable storyline predictable, interesting characters, special effects cheap and motionless !!!! Horror lovers do not really need to follow this rare film, you will not miss much of my trust !!! I give this movie 2/10.
