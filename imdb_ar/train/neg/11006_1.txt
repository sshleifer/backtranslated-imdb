This movie starred, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joe Buttafuoco - not exactly the names that scream "quality". With this gigantic play, "The Mannequins of the Mannequins," which is the exact same thing, a man steals a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), a dead man with rotting bodies, black market embryos (a man who is supposed to be outside Jar), ​​lots and lots of gay jokes, a comic play about the giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortion. The non-fairy dramas are painful (like "Batman and Rhymer"), acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and raw film just because it is raw ... and stupid. I really think that a group of 8 year olds could have made EASILY a fun movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> This film appears to have resulted in a lawsuit against "Slap Shot" Vince against the Scientologists. Frankly, I will not know who you should reach in this case !!! It seems that the Scientologists allegedly destroyed his reputation in some way and drowned the film. No matter that the film is undesirable repellent from start to finish and 99% is not funny (compared, Ebola is more entertaining) ... These are the most beautiful things I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> In a way, IS Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wears a diaper and participates in a stupid fake pornographic film. It is amazing that his career can be overcome.
