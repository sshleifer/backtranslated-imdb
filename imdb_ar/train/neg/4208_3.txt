There is a really good film lying directly beneath the layers of layers on the layers of "Pagemaster" cheese. <br /> <br /> I discovered this when I saw this again this morning after being neglected for years and years. I remember her reluctance when she first appeared, but this time, I found that the special effects are very good. The plot is just a "neverending story" with an esoteric mastectomy, but it's a little flick for anyone who just wants a really wonderful dessert. The animation is amazing, and I particularly liked how the animation left its characters looking and acted a bit more surreal than usual. I give it a three degree as I * * * granted it two (just for spoof value) if I had ever decided to watch this movie and I would expect it to blow up my mind perfectly.
