This is just a bad film. With what seemed like a nice budget, it was probably much better. It was almost. With a beautiful heroine like Salma Hayek, almost a combat hero like Jackie Chan, battles and fairs are almost like the Crouching Tiger ..., and almost like music in, Conan ... etc. Approximately. But in the end it's boring and it's hard to find anything interesting in it. Perhaps apart from John Reese-Davies, who flies in a duel like those fighters in the hero or crouching tiger mentioned earlier ... I am really ashamed of John the poor old man. He is after all a good actor and deserves much better. So you - so if you still have a chance, just watch something else.
