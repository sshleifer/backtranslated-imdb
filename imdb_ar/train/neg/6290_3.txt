The marriage is feared to pose a threat to his distinctive family business client and decides to arrange Ron's bachelor's degree. But his real plan is to put Ron in a settlement position, get the evidence and break Ron and Mil. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's supposed to be a sequel to a classic comic but it's not funny at all. The age of puberty and juvenile excuse is mostly shown to show women wearing negligible clothing. In fact, in a way, it is impressive to have a lot that you can put there, because it is everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also a movie tag that can not support itself. It's simply not good enough. <br /> <br /> Contains three replacement points, or in fact three reps deserve better text than this. It's the main actor Josh Cook who can actually give an impression of some common sense. Sara Foster I know that she has more talent than doing such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have more talent than this film. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously absent is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are very rare. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
