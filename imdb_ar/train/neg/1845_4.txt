Loss of control is another symptom of this kind of sensational excitement, which can be considered a fiction in the film world. Typically, it involves a rotten road to a fatal intent, interspersed with proliferating disrobing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunning beautiful women who always live in this upscale world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Keira Reid) suffers from a group of writers. Just by coincidence, (or is she?) She meets a man (Doug Geoffrey) who takes part in more serious sexual encounters with her. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim consistently refuses to stop the case. Her agent, Alexa (Aniliza Scott) believes she will achieve miracles for the sales of her book. As in most films of this type, the approach is nearing the end but some things do not accumulate. I've seen enough of these kind of movies to think about, do not change there, then - but I love them. She is very lenient. <br /> <br /> Representatives are different. Doug Geoffrey holds the film as a psycho / social person who does not want to cross it. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince her that she is in danger. Clay Greenbush where PI did not convince them either. <br /> <br /> Finally, a warning note about a DVD is under review. Both the cover condition and the disc are rated R and the operating time is 93 minutes but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. Maybe that explains why sex scenes look broken and why the performance of Jennifer Ludlow is shortened as it began. 4 Stars.
