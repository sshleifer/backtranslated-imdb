Hopper is not funny, not fast paced, non-romantic and unhelpful. There is no real drama. You might think that a film about the greatest man of the world's trick will get some drama, there was an attempt but it was not real. There is no study of the characters, no lessons learned, so it did not seem as if the actors were enjoying any real fun, but were trying to act as if they were enjoying themselves. There is no reason to watch unless you want to take a look at Bert and you want to get a glimpse of Sally. The horse was nice and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, he was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was so enjoyable that I was ready for Hooper. This film turned into a real disappointment and a waste of time
