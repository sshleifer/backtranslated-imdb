The only way to get anything from this movie is to deal with it as a comedy. Seen in this light, it does not deliver. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film never has any depth, and provides more than just a quick, one-dimensional search of "issues" without any vision at all. <br /> <br /> Creating a film about stereotypes and then making every character in the film a stereotype is a very bad strategy - especially when those same characters only break their vulgar patterns in predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the movie almost watchable, and Michael Rappaport turns out to be a good performer, but the script is very bad and the social comment is very vulgar, and it's hard to find anything retrieved.
