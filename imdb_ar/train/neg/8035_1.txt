This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'll rent any horror movie unless it's set up for TV when looking at the box, it indicates that R was rated for gore and some languages ​​... where was Gore? Was it the good death scene I saw in Gore? He could have overlooked that if there was some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There was no clever or remotely interesting line in this limp film. Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was sad.
