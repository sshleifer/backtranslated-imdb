It is unreasonable that the script is as vulgar and completely silly that can make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes the cat woman look like a classic high culture. Billy Zane plays a bad harmonica role, and Elvis impersonates, shoots, and the martial arts master who gamers the life of a former football player turned into gambling addiction to NBC's Nacional Action Star. Its performance is cool like snow and not in a cool way. "The Movie" happens in Vegas, and since people play poker there, the book felt it was a perfect place for a movie about someone trying to survive for 24 hours against a rich gambler everywhere who made his $ 2.4 million target if he could make it During the day. So the chase entails it. The chase is characterized by unappealing explosions, building yard settings, poor cinematography, and inscriptions that contain the word "bet" or "gamble". The winners are also thrown into the mix, but for whatever reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry, NAS fans make the losers an unforgettable veil. The sudden end will lead to the socks stop if you like the ability to predict or plagiarism. Joel Silver must reassess his decision to sell more. I hope he will give me these two hours of my life.
