Little spoilers! <br /> <br /> Well, I sat late and watched this movie, mainly because I enjoyed classifying some of the previous Singleton works like "Boyz n the hood". However, I have to say that this was a great disappointment and it is all I hate about fabricated or vulgar "messages". <br /> <br /> Acting is mainly acting, (do not necessarily make pop stars and models are good actors ... they notice), and situations that are difficult to swallow (becoming rape victims all night long ... please!) , But worst of all it promotes all the stereotypes that you can think of. By the second half of the film, it has become a cartoon in its characterization, making you lose any shred of sympathy you may have towards its one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> No true point has been made about the underlying causes of racism, cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it only ends up raising the results of these problems. It is a contradictory message, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of cohesion of the plot. As for the films I have found, they have been found to be predictable, confusing, exploitative and somewhat insulting. For a film called "Higher Education", I must say that all I learned was to avoid seeing this again. <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the topics that this movie has failed to fully explain then go to "American History X" .... unless you're only viewing it for Tyra Banks, then go to Rent Life .
