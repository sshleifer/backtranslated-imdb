This overstatement series, short-lived (two modest seasons) revolves around experience and unique like the truck driver who goes to strip strip. I'm not quite sure what they mean by the "flagship" and "original" when they squirm around Lynch and the silly little TV Ops. What exactly is their criteria What is the original? Certainly, compared to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" is an original. definitely. Next to "Law & Order" TP publishes the authenticity left and right. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say that the show was canceled because many viewers were not smart enough, open enough to show the "weirdness" of the supposed show. "It's just a moving scene, but a silly whore that circles around it, and there are nets in every corner, but there's nothing very far from TP. (Or because of it) will never reach anywhere ... The characters do not behave in a strange way as they behave in a stupid way half the time ... <br /> <br /> Whenever you see the sequence of " "In the" Living In Oblivion "criticizing the dwarf director (Buscemi) because of the old tired option, let's use a cliche in the middle of the dream, think of Lynch. "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact, it's far from weird, it's just basic, you want a unique TV show, you see "the prisoner." You want a weird cast? The cast gives TP a plastic look Kens & Barbies collectively. <br /> <br /> In fact, one TP producer said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Cheryl Finn? Such "deceptive" blocks faced directly by men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with getting an attractive crew, especially with beauty like Fenn (the way Madonna looks like the nicest 1000 times), but then do not walk around saying you're making a "weird show with people who look weird." I never understood Lynch's misguided charm with Kyle MacLachlan (I have to get a medal to annoy her to spell out his name correctly). It is not improbable, but lacks charisma, and looks very nice and polished. The "oddity" of his character was not at all laughable; it was just one of Lynch's many attempts to impose strangeness, trying to rise to the level of his reputation - completely lost his superiority but then. Lynch's all-time post-elephant man was substandard compared to his first two films. What followed was a modest effort that often depended on the relatively small but fanatical fan base of Lynch to keep him in the public eye by translating the meanings in his stories into a bad situation that did not scrutinize any water. In other words, Lynch is loved by every wannabe intellectual. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? He was a devil obsessed or some of that nonsense. This is the best that can come to this "great mind" ... I've got horror movies B-movie ending with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not bright and does not work hard enough to get to a great story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check the list of "TV and Cinema: 150 of the worst cases of cronyism."
