The movie is worth watching only if it stops working after half an hour. It starts with funny conversations in a pub and makes one expect a good and funny story to come. Well, I can tell you it will not come. It will deteriorate in minutes to a film that defies your patience as well as your feelings of shame to the actors you will not be happy to watch. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director wanted to express in this film a feeling of loss of identity, according to him, the majority of people in this global experience of globalization. I was amazed to hear that. Do I live in the same world in which I live? Well, many people walk around in the same clothes I wear and listen to the same music and all, but that does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What Khrzhanosvky believes, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the films we see? Am I short-sighted or is it? <br /> <br /> Well my vote: The good start of the movie saves it from getting 1, and the 4 respectable is deductive.
