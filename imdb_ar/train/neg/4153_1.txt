I have no idea how to comment on this film. The special effects were dim, the representation was terrible, and if there was a plot on everything, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember that a bad film a long time ago, I am a big fan of sex and lesbians! ;) So he could not save this film from being just a terrible excuse to push someone to stand (or lie down in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Overall the "zombie" effect. Since it appears in this film, the zombie is so common that it runs around a couple here and there, and talks about it at a fuel station (one with a windshield repair at home but no indoor bathroom), zombie films are not even working Till the end. Even so, the zombie veil that tears the girl's clothes does not represent the fact that it is a zombie film. <br /> <br /> The Vampires: It is obvious that all zombies are male and that all vampires are females, which is OK for me. I'm not sure the vampire's out in broad daylight, or why / how a vampire soldier has become standing in the middle of the road, holding on to his rifle with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the vampire queen to dust all the way through. The last part of the old nun is meaningless, and when a vampire asks another hot lesbian vampire hot lesbian "Do you think we did the right thing?" By killing the visible heroes in the film, put it on top. <br /> <br /> Special effects and effects were also at their lowest levels. You can almost see hoses that have been pumped through fake blood during the telephoto of the zombie that stunned the general. When talking about the general, where did they find this "Kenny Rogers" both? No idea what the general was, no matter how confused the place was. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie if you do not have the best to do it or if you have a strong desire to waste $ 3. Just my $ 0.02.
