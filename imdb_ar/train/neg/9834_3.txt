One of the most "Lone Stars" stars, while spending time developing personality, interaction, dialogue and acting. The opening scene paves the stage (literally) for the characters of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler), and his friend John Scott (John Wayne) Rodeo star (says Roh-Dai-Oh), both slightly Randy. The film follows their adventures, where they try to improve each other in the pursuit of Mexican Juanita, and later in their pursuit of Marie-Marie Cornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (although the real villain has lost his way and wants to repent). Oh, of course, they are wrongly accused of two crimes and they have to go to jail before they finally escape and be acquitted. <br /> <br /> The important point is that Scott continues to play Mary's role deliberately in her grocery store, and expel the ladder on which he stands so he can grab her and grab her as she falls. Everything seems to be quite contemporary to the West in the 1930s, but it seems better than reality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the exciting elements of animation found in many of the other Lone Stars are badly missing here. No Yakima Kanout. Uses cheap and bad footage of riders falling horses. Not George Hayes. Tedious Stooge-like-two-play between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging in Scott, Scott trampling on his foot and then pounding him (repeated twice more!). Paul Fix is ​​untapped. Eddie Chandler himself, here in its big, unbelievable sideways keel. Punk looks very old and fat. The same goes for Chandler, who later spent his career in another 300 films as an unsupported willow holder. Mary Cornman, from the 1920s "Our Gang" (see "Mary, Queen of Tots" 1925) is nice to see with John Wayne, but that's about it. The best Western lie seeds buried here. <br /> <br /> P.S. The very short, very good color version moves very quickly and is over if it winks more than once. Fortunately, the embarrassing scenes were cut with Eddie Chandler.
