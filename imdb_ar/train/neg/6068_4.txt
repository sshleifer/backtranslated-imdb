Vodka Lemon is a charming Armenian film, but it is very uneven, some will delight and carry others. Although reasonably phrased, the film lacks any real "zing", relying instead on many scenes that may seem familiar to the art house audience. The film contains a few moments of enormous cinematic brilliance, and unfortunately deserve a film worthy of his genius. It is very dark to be a dark comedy and because it is a serious tragedy, Vodka Lemon will leave many confused and turbulent views in the end. You may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between a sea of ​​landscape filled with snow-filled chain and an endless series of bus rides. Nabil effort, was ultimately done because of the cohesion narrative.
