This mini-series, also based on a book by Alex Haley on behalf of "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, ie, building a long history after a family life over many years. While the "queen" was the ingenious result, here in Mama Flora the inspiration was nonexistent. First perhaps in the book itself, certainly in this television production. Much of the wheel is put over the years, so that the epic unfolding is shallow and superficial and is not nearly as real as the "Queen". Complete signs of the scenario in the previous parts of the film, which were prepared very carefully, but with the progress of the film it seemed to turn into a kind of unpalatable combination of unpalatable dallasian in the last third of three hours or so. I hope more. But it is clear that Halley was less inspired than this story from his semi-autobiographical "Queen" biography, and Peter Werner III is not identical to John Ehrman. It is recommended only for those who have appetite for these long tales of the emerging generations.
