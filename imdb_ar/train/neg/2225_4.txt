Frankly, I can not understand why this film is rated well here, nor why Bakshi thought he was his best film. I'm a big fan of the previous Bakshi work - especially Heavy Traffic and Wizards, but frankly Wizards (1977) was his last good film. After that, he turned to the mainstream, starting with the demonic "Lord of the Rings", then the sword and sorcery of Frank Frazeta, for "fire and ice". <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is childish, animated is the quality of television - insisted it is much worse than his seventies things - and while the Wizards had a real imagination, suspense, some wonderful background arts, and underground sensitivity, and adults, Fire and Ice was designed Only to 14-year-old boys, and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you love Gore books, you may want to. In my opinion, this was just another point in the slide in quality after the "treatments" that Bakshi did not recapture (although he did some fairly decent television recently) <br /> <br /> 4.5 of 10
