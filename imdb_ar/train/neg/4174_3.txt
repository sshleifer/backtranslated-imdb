This was clearly one of the worst problems I had seen throughout the summer. Granted, it was on Fi Sci, I do not watch too much Sci Fi, but the guy, talking about a thin razor plot and two dimensional figures to the extreme. <br /> <br /> The characters were over and over, the plot and preparation were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, and more funny, the bull was not necessary, the special effects were alarming on the right, and the end? Well, the only unpredictable thing about the end is when the girl suddenly becomes a lesbian and begins to do so using the female vampire, who, by the way, is not all that hot air because of it for about three seconds, you're closer to "What the hell ? " Then "Man, this is hot." If this appears at any time, God forbid, do not see it.
