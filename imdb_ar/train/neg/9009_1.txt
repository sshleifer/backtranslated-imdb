What an awesome movie! For some reason, the scientific laboratories and settlement outposts always have a team of bad guys, ugly dirt living inside. These people who supposedly work together in complex scientific projects do not seem to agree on how to escape death by the CGI dragon. The spoilers: A strange world, the skill of acting is "mockery" and "evil stare" has reproduced a dragon. While the laboratory was supposed to work on this kind of thing, the other scientists were shocked, because apparently they were all late in their experiments and hit their pants. The rest of the story is like the thing, or ten little Indians, where the staff are tracked and killed while trying to craft a way to escape the "dragon" and / or defeat it. CGI Dragon Dark Gray creature, which seems to be the most popular color for most CGI special effects cheap. Barely look better than a caricature, dark gray colors make it hard to see any interesting details in the dragon's body. All it seems is a gray dot. Representation is less than terrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who can not agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, and so on. Dean Cain is better than any unknown actors in this movie. He seems to be drowning to the level of his support team. This film is really, really brutal. The representation is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing to be praised about this film, it is not even deadly time to take a look at while doing housework or other business.
