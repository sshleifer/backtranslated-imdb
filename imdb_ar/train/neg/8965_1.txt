It is a fairly low budget, made for television, a kind of film designed to take advantage of the success of the original. I am a fan of B films, and this film might be well if they did not comment on it "Cube", because as it was, the director and the original plot were better, and this film destroys my taste for the whole series. The characters are annoying and cliched, there are problems in continuity, and many screws are direct production. The story hardly gets the chance to evolve because of unnecessary dialogue and suffering from it. They use the same horror tricks in one way or another during the film, and because the first one was very good, it has simply become a disappointment. The movie, maybe I give it about four. His "1" rating was largely a statement of how strongly he was affected by the effects and intelligence of the first classification.
