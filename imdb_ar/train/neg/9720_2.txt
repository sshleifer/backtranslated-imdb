This film is only boring. <br /> <br /> He tries to copy some of the borrowed effects of a creative director such as Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it is too much. Dialogues are very bad, some of the worst I have heard of, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I never find him convincing), his father in the film plays very badly, the story is stupid, the result is stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I have not hated a lot of film since "le pacte des loups" from Christophe Gans (and I watch and see about 80 to 100 films a year), but at least this film has some actions and lots of Good actors. <br /> <br /> I have never commented here (evaluation only), and when I saw the ratings and comments, I thought I had to write something had happened. <br /> <br /> I think we will not have any problems selling the DVD we offered: it's not a bad movie in our (big) group !!! <br /> <br /> I think open-minded (watching SF, Westerners, drama, comedy, silence, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this film was so boring that I felt I had lost an hour and a half.
