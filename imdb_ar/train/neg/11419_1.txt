I think I've seen this thing before: college graduates do not realize they're very good, all the time, complaining that their lives are sucking. <br /> <br /> This movie is very derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bites, which I can make from it: They have practically the same plot. <br /> <br /> If anything good came out of this snoring celebration, it was music. It was. <br /> <br /> To me, I'm not affected ... but again, I did not expect anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another film that has to be shown only with a ring with blindfolds. <br /> <br /> Now to rule: It's one movie out of 10.
