Painful to watch, not quite in order to sympathize with the conflicts of characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia Mother and Monica the Recognized Daughter, spend most of the film in pathetic recreation and bitter dog respectively. Their characters are so entrenched that their redemption can not be believed to be accepted after quick family respite. It was not worth the wait. I wish the stadium was worth the honesty among families less than a headache.
