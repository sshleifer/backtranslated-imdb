This film may have been given a higher rating before the appearance of the Peter Jackson trio, but seeing the two of them side by side is no comparison. The pace of this film is accelerated, many important scenes are left out of the book, there is little twist in characters. Animation is a strange mix of traditional caricatures and live motion scenes that have been drawn, and which I found scattered. The most disappointing thing about this film is that it starts in the middle of the story and never ends. There are some good points - exciting battle scenes to watch, and the dialogue follows the book largely on the message. Watch this if you are in a hurry and can not spend 10 hours watching a new trio. But if you do not read the book, it is likely to be confused, because there is much missing from this version. 4 of 10.
