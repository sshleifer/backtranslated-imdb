I am always surprised at how different people are and how almost every film gets. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata will not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's there. First of all sound. Producers spent more time in soundtrack than editing. Her voice was very loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking. When Patrika was talking in her monotonous voice, it was hard to hear. <br /> <br /> Patrica and Gaberial are usually loved, but they were both flat in this film. Patrika had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in severe pain, or very angry of the stain. The first was the prevailing, the second was about pain screaming, and the third was about raising her voice. It was the high voice that inspired the three and not the emotion. <br /> <br /> I may have missed a lot of deep meaning and sub-sections that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the horrible shooting and MTV style. When you watch a 3-minute video, you need quick cuts and slow motion to tell a quick story, in a two-hour feature film, that's nauseating. He failed to see the meaning of her vision that women sit by foot and have a child. And do not fall in the city of Pittsburgh often !! <br /> <br /> I think this is probably a real story, something could have been meant, but the whole budget was spent buying music and equipment for a slow rain, dropping shots and renting that huge apartment where I lived Mrs. Arquette, where it ended up shooting the man with the story.
