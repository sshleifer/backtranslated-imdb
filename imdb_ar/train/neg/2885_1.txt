I can not really say my opinion in this film, it's against the guidelines, I've watched many movies and this must be the worst yet, very low budget, I think all the money went to the slaughterhouse sights and the reason I can do better using a camera 8 mm and a crew of monkeys. It was very bad so I checked in just to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, the movie rental place was not enough. But this is worth my year, I suggest borrowing from some of the poor sapers who hired it and watched it yourself. The reason I would definitely not waste money on it myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you have not made it in the rental place when they do not refund your money .. =)
