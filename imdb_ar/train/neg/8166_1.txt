I asked for a copy of The Forest because I was watching your VH1 film, and I think "where are they now" and watched the video box flicker across the screen during a clip on actor Corky Pigeon. The ghost of the male child played in this terrible horror B, but I remember him from his personality Freddy in the program Silver Spoons TV. This flick was a big disappointment. There is nothing here. It took me four months to see it from start to finish. I kept him in the boredom, put him aside and forgot, then found him and tried again to pass on him. It is clear that the angle of this film that was aimed at distinguishing it from its peers was the supernatural element, the emergence. Obviously, here, this does not work. I can not stand the male lead. I kept expecting to look at their hands during the long dialogue scenes to read the lines of fraud. The situation at first where couples decide to go to camps separately is embarrassing and simple. I think the only positive thing I should say about this is the scene where the man falls and breaks his leg, and you can see the bone coming out of his body. It's pretty good makeup there. Hey man, I really expect positive results now, huh. The only other non-budget horror film on a bad level will be Home Sweet Home.
