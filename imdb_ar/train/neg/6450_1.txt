Well, this film is amazingly terrifying. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Sometimes delivered with a little irony, which led me to believe that they did not take this film seriously, and no one watching this hateful can win the demised monster. While watching this "unknown creature" I could only think that there was not much budget or a qualified writer on the crew. But, if you go to watch this for laughter you'll be happy, the film is a shame to make fun of itself because I can not see how anyone can look at this and proud to pump this directly to DVD Clichy Want to be a thriller / horror battles The film is light.
