Do you know those movies that were trapped in the cinema? You are stuck there in the best seat at home, in the middle of the row in your sweet place that you switch three times before you get the right seat completely - and after about 13 hours still trapped there, uncomfortable and itching, thinking "when F *** This movie will never end ??? " (You know the feeling - Think of A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q offers a strange variable to this feeling. I sat there for 30 minutes first wondering when it starts! It does not end! So "Arty" hurts me. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I saw. He obviously makes films by dozens, and if they all claim like this, I think he will be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. There is David Lynch among the top 10 managers for me, but Visitor X is a cheap, cheap, and bad buzz rate. <br /> <br /> As you may have done now - hate her.
