I have requested this very rare and exaggerated film on eBay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal horror lover, from the 1980s the American cheese to European zombie films, I told myself that this would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I think it would have been more wonderful than it really was. After all I heard about this film, I was almost scared to see it. Murder is boring. Representation ... forget it, there is no representation! Story, even if we do not care, very bad. They seem to have tried to draw your attention with some exotic sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case, the film does not help. why? There is no atmosphere, this is the worst thing in this flick. It's just a bad production of movies from point A to B. Although it's very funny and fun to watch it with your friends and lots of beer, do not make any effort to get your hands. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro Files!
