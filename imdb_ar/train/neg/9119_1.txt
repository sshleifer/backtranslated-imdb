I have seen this movie in the theater again in the original release. It was painful to see Peter Sellers deeply embarrassed himself. The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was sad to see how the mighty fell. I would not say I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really enjoyed the Pink Panther group and felt that he had a strong performance in Being There. But this film should never be. From what I read, he continued to produce this film against the advice of people around him. Well, but that does not justify the studio that actually releases the film.
