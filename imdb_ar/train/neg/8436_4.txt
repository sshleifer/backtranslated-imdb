David Mamet is a very interesting and extremely unequal manager. His first film "House of Games" was the film I liked best, putting a series of films with characters changing their perspective in complex situations, as well as a viewer's perspective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Further "homicide The main characters are two policemen, one Jewish and an Irishman who deals with a racially charged area. The killing of an old Jewish shopkeeper who proves to be a veteran of the Israeli War of Independence raises the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish investigator. <br /> <br /> These were the disadvantages of the film. Are more obvious. The process of Awakening is playable and hard to believe, and the group of Jewish fighters is practical, and the way in which the mabahith eventually leads to the recent violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is as clever as Mamet, but she is disappointed by a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of Mantegna and William Macy offers strong performances, but the flaws of the story are so obvious that they can not be easily compensated.
