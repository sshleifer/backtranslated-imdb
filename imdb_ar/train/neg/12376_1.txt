This group really absorbs! <br /> <br /> I hired her, and I think I would really enjoy some good fighting. Man sucked this! Very fast and cheerful clips, a very annoying loudspeaker, and the intense and intense battles they had on themselves (I think particularly of Jet Li's battle in Fists of legend and Jackie Chan's fight from master drunk) What is the deal with these rioters in the streets? What is "wonderful" about it? I've seen more interesting battles on Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This stupid collection of cuts on stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who made these craps to produce more of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, go to buy movies that have been fighting through them and stir up battles in their uncut glory!
