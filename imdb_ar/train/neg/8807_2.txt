I chose Dead Creatures because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 Days" or so ... but not at all. It's not a horror film. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who appear to be infected with a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot leads to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibals ... <br /> <br /> Very VERY BAD MOVIE. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
