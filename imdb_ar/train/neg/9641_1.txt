If you're watching this movie, you're either a fan of Fred Olen Ray, and I found it on the shelf for $ 4.99 at Suncoast and thought "What should I lose?" , Or you're around the video shop and close your eyes and hired the first movie I touched your finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It contains all that a terrible film needs: a film that presents a dialogue on the jaw and intriguing courses in the plot, an idiot that includes psychological characters and other dimensions, continuity that seems to pass through holes in time and space, actors not just wood, Naked and unwarranted nudity (not necessarily all you want), and of course, a 5-minute-long monster playing what I suppose is Fred Olin Ray's child. <br /> <br /> However, there is something like a heart - as if Micky & Judy decided to collect all the children in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (Hey, my dad can take it out!) We can use red paint from your hardware store Johnny Johnny, and I know this former stripper who can dispose of it!). <br /> <br /> Watch the blooper reel on credits - you can find out why the final movie cut was very crappy. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... The Alien Force is well worth a look, but they do not have the same crappy veneer that this one does.
