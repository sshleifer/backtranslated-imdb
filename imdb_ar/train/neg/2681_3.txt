A very good story for a movie, if done correctly would be interesting, but where the hell is the end of this film? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the purpose? <br /> <br /> The scenes are going so fast that you felt you were not part of the movie emotionally, feeling detached from understanding the story story. <br /> <br /> The performance of the cast is doubtful, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? I think we have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
