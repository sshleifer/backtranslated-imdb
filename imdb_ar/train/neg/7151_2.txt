I am proud to say that I have seen all three Fast and Furious movies. Sure, the plots are a bit silly and may be a bit cheese, but I love them chasing cars, all the beautiful cars, and secret midnight races. I see Ill gladly see a fourth. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the difference between these three and Redline? Decent work, which was thought to some extent, even if they were experimenters, and last but not least, directors who have every idea. All three directed by very competent directors, all took the films in a different direction, and equally exciting. The red line seems to have chosen the product dozens of women were sleeping on the sofa, making them additions, and then picked up the line of unemployment in Hollywood. And the scenario. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.This is a 70-made bad TV movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film had a few wonderful cars, but you do not see the fact that many are at work, and the work is directed so badly you can not get excited from chases, if the cars do not impress you, why You go to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a group of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing out loud. I get dirty looks, but this was just a disaster. <br /> <br /> He rented F & F movies. Go to Nascar Race.Go to the karting track and race yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
