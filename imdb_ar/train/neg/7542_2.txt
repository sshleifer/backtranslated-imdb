This film is supposed to be mysterious and dangerous for a man looking for a missing girl. However, after 30 minutes of the film, it turns into a funny and unreal story with disturbing characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone laughing when Keg karate randomly kicks that blond girl or when the old lady "bears" that punch. Fonts, characters, and representations are poorly executed from the start. I have always loved Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some horrible films this year; this is by far the worst (so far ...). <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an exciting film that controls the story. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. However, if you are going to watch it, get ready to laugh at some lines and end the scenes rather than take them seriously; this is the only way you enjoy this movie.
