The orange ring for everything was just yuki. Oh, yes, the main character lives in the Jewish Quarter, fully dyed with people dyed orange. At the same time, to escape mentally from this extreme poverty in the body, play a complete video game indulgences (which suck that there are no clear rules and no logic follows the way of playing). She seems to earn an income playing the game, but it turns out that she is not an employee in the game company. A lot of non-stop speakers later the story continues slowly. It uses a bright orange computer interface with a very annoying operating interface and I can only doubt a future version of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I am a viewer, basically asking why her valuable time is lost in some adventure game when she barely has the necessities of life? Oh yeah, playing games is fun, but what's the point when you're almost hungry? As her life spills away from playing a video game filled with opaque orange mystery, her dog runs away (perhaps looking for a husband who pays at least a moment of attention to her and feeds her regularly) or is stolen from the woman (while ignoring the fact that the orange is poor). <br /> <br /> At the same time, she is concerned about some of the games lost by her team playing in the entire movie. Yawning. So she wants to be the best, go and get her Ash Catchem (we got all of them). Jolie, this main character is absorbed as a human being as well and has no alternative qualities regardless of her physical beauty (which she can somehow trade to escape her overwhelming poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "real" level, which is, at least, not terribly absorbing, and is sent to kill his ex-comrade in a coma that lives mentally at the "real" level. But he has the ability to say something like "the main character is trapped in the imagined poverty of the computer and is already in the real world now." Maybe she will do the killing and live in the real world now? Well, she kills the man and disappears in Digital effect, awesome, thank you stupid director, you suck, you suck so much, the director. <br /> <br /> Here, I had For the director of an atom of opportunity to recover himself a bit by burying this horrible terrible terrible film with a philosophical twist. The director could have said, "The real world exists, and if you live in it and contribute to make it better, you will not be There are some dark areas of poverty in orange. "A clever way to make this film full of lessons is a painfully slow lesson for the basic civic pride (for 1% of viewers who did not find anything fun to watch at this stage or are cinema advocates). <br /> <br /> No, the director. The director had to prove it all by throwing some nasty digital effects and destroying all the chances of recovery for this terrible film that was a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of viewer confidence. <br /> After that, it ends. Good salvation. I hope the manager stifles the director. I put HACK in the "Avoid at all costs" list for any other movies whose name is attached to them.
