It makes sense to me that this movie gets cheers from Hollywood because it is often in Hollywood everything is just a popular contest. It also makes sense to think that people who like the movie may interact only with the countless songs that spit on you rather than the story's content. So far, this movie is overpriced and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy looks just silly. In no way did Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles offer the Oscar-winning performance since many had taken it before the film ended. I can not even believe that Condon is being prepared for the Oscar nomination for Directing when all he did was put an album. Glitz does not replace the story of nothing. A group of songs do not make films.
