I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novel by science fiction writer Brian Aldes, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Hao, twins who are joined by a family by Imperialo to form a rock band. /> The film is almost a very input, as it is very clever to half (if you will pardon the pun). By mixing species, styles and moods, directors (whose previous film is Lost In La Mancha) lose their way very quickly. I was not sure whether I should take it seriously or not. Past memories, dream sequences, everything was just a lot. In addition, the promised rock and roll did not move me. I was reminded a little during the times of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a film I originally found and moved. But in this case, the songs were not good, and the main characters were not sympathetic. A more unfavorable comparison would be velvet velvet similarly disappointing.
