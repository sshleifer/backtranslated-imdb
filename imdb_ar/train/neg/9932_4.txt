Dan Doria, a good actor in B-making a lot of nice feelings in the 1940s, can not do much with it: the young man is accused of killing an unhappy singer; when he is sentenced to death, his wife decides to solve the case herself with the help of the woman's husband Dead. After a wonderful opening shot, the flick settles quickly in the B-movie format. It certainly looked good, but the touches were colorlessly treated and the team (including Peter Laurie and Brodrick Crawford) was a little solid. Based on Cornell and Woolrich's novel, they can be seen to watch one. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
