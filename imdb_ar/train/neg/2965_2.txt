This film was interesting ... I had to watch it for a university class from India, but the summary tells you that this film revolves around one thing when it does not really contain much cold and hard information about those details. Is not true in the summary until the end when they try to tie all the elements together. Gore factor is wonderful, however. So at first, you want to look away because the hole is very dense. Watch this movie only if you want to see some wonderful things, because the chart is thin and will make you sad to waste time listening to it. I've seen rumors of other Web sites that this movie is based on real events, yet you can not find any information about it online ... so it was a waste of time to watch it.
