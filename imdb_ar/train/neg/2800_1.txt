One of my best friends brought this one-night movie with "Do you want to watch the worst horror film ever?" I always enjoy a good laugh horror flick and said yes. I was expecting your cheesy model b-slasher model but this was far from B. This is a Z-slasher, a low low. Thanks to the clearly low budget, very bad representation, light lightning, no plot, so-called "really bad" special effects, shaky cameras and horrible soundtracks, making movies like House of Wax look like an Oscar winner. The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of getting one of the nude characters - it had some very nice tits. Most of what I said during this film was "Wow this is SO BAD", "This is the worst film ever" and "I'm not drunk enough for this". In conclusion: Do not waste your time (or money!).
