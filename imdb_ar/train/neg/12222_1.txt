(Frankly, Barbara, I know you're the one who clicks on all these "no" in my assessment 22 times How many people do you have to help you here? Do not you have anything better to do, like looking at yourself in the mirror all day? ) <br /> <br /> Stephen Spielberg told Barbara that "this is the best film I've ever seen since" Citizen Ken. "That pretty much says it all - and acts as a serious warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients The drama of Barbara Streisand, a musician, a feminist, the voice of Barbara Streisand, directed by Barbara Streisand, Hollywood is full of the Roman man, that's what we know so much. "In fact, almost everyone, by definition, should be mad in Hollywood, why would anyone want to act? Well, if you are stupid enough to believe what they say to you in their carefully prepared interviews, and Streisand has the greatest ego of them all, this is a wonderful achievement - to be surrounded by narcissistic Cretans, yet you must lead them all. <br /> <br /> The film, like all its "individual" endeavors, is an ego journey straight from hell. Every scene in Streisand is destroyed automatically. She was born dead. But because they were not enough, they sing a full set of Streisandy songs? As you know, the kind that enabled Maria Carriles, Celine Dunes, Whitney Houston from this world to poison our precious airwaves for decades now. Just because they do not deserve one or 100 episodes of South Park make fun of them. <br /> <br /> The premise, Straisand is to wear her clothes as a man to study to become a rabbi, looks like Zany zaz comedy. Apart from being clich√©s, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman and does not look like a man ?? In fact I'm not sure they are human. How do you look in this movie, okay? Can not be described by words. ET Jock looks like a high school compared. Looks more exotic than Michael Jackson in 2015. She looks appalling. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me tremble. Especially "Papa can you hear me as she wears such a terrible female from the heat in the heat?" And "Tomorrow night I will prepare the sequel, YENTL 2: Return of the bitch." <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand thought of getting a nose job early in her career, but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change? Can you believe it? She had to do it! Kill two flies with one blow, that's what it would be like. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biography of Barbara Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me via email. <br /> <br /> Should BARBRA STREISAND move permanently to retirement?
