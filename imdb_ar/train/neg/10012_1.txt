This movie must be in line for the most boring movies in years. Even Harrison can not save this film from drowning in the bottom. <br /> <br /> The murder in this film is supposed to be of interest in this film, but it is not, nothing matters. The actors are not bad, but the script is just awful, I sat in complete amazement during this film, thinking about how anyone could find this movie amusing <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very smart. They made a boring film but they hid it with good actors and representatives in their team. People will go to the famous movies and they may be watching this movie and thinking about it, Woody Harrison, Christine Scott Thomas and Willem Daphoe, this should be good and rent this film. If you want to get a rough cut and rent this movie, some people have already enjoyed this movie but I love watching a meaningful movie
