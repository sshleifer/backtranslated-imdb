What kind of sh * t this? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was as good a scene as the first film at first, but from the part where the protagonists get superpower in their dreams, it has become childish. This picture should have been rated PG or PG-13 instead of R. I was expecting to see some very mature stuff but that was only for a third of the movie. Rest for young children. In addition, it focuses heavily on Christianity. I know that Freddie is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways to fight devils. Why should Christianity always be? This is total Orientalism and full of superiority of white / western men. Do not see this, and show it to young children who love Power Rangers.
