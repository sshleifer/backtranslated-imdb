: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in the joy of lasting love. I was really waiting a long time to see him, and I finally had the opportunity when it was re-broadcast Thursday evening on Holmark. I loved the first three "Love" movies, but this film was not as I thought it would be. The entire film was sad and frustrating, and there was a way to a lot of loopholes, and editing was so bad - because of many scenes outside the context. I also think that the death of the child Cathy happened soon and that Clarks' appearance in the film was not right. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they all lacked emotion. There seems to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. <br /> <br /> I think the script writers had to go over the book. Every film created so far seems to slip away from the writings of Janet Oak. I mean in the film they did not mention anything about the mine and the boys or Clark because of it. I think the reactions of Messi and Williams to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been produced so far, I must say that the joy of permanent love is my least favorite. I hope with the next four films to follow more of the book and if Clarks' personality in it I hope to have a bigger role and I hope that his role is very nice. I also hope there will be more Scotty, Cookie and possibly Marty, but who knows what future scriptwriters will have.
