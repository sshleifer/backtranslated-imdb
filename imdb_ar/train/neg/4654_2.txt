Female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she asks or turn into a blood sucker. After a few people were killed, regret became remorse and fell in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this film? The speed of its playback is very slow, it contains some exotic sound effects (never a bizarre bite) and ambience (the new jazz that I came here) and the lights do not seem to be included in the set. It looks like a horror film "author" with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite stupid and as you can guess, they are the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she does not do it; you must do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny film. Maybe with some friends and lots of beer, he could not have funny aspects (honestly, it's funny over 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by a Troma poster, it's a bad movie they make.
