Absolute garbage. The reason that this is very terrible is not because he deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The supposed star did nothing to resolve the issue - and no one else actually did - it was just routine police work. Completely boring. <br /> <br /> I sat quite to the end in the hope of an evolution - and felt only a great sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was a great possibility of having a relative in an apparent abduction. Can the personal involvement of the lieutenant ultimately obscure his rule? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were for a stranger to do so. But a genius like Lt C, through an ongoing conversation with the oppressed husband, will gradually discover a vicious conspiracy involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while the masked bridegroom surprises the bride, hides the body, and then implants hidden clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
