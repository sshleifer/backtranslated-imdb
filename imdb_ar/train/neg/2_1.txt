I saw the suspension of the capsule say "great acting". In my opinion, these are two great actors who perform horribly, and without chemistry, a great director in his worst effort at all. Robert de Niro must be the most intelligent and insightful of all time. Jane Fonda's performance drifts uncomfortably throughout the map, where she clearly has no idea of ​​this character, mostly because the character is badly written. Such as molasses will be a very fast recipe for the speed of this amazing film. Although the intention of the film is to be an upscale story about the treatment of illiteracy, only to see it as the real "problem". I give her one out of 10 films, which is really one of the 20 worst films I have ever seen in my life.
