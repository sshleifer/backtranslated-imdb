I do not know much about filmmaking, but good films have to tell a story ... Your characters must start and complete their journey. In another exit to Brooklyn, they can, but not in any satisfactory way, I do not mean happy ending, just no end. <br /> <br /> Another exit to Brooklyn, which was set in 1952 in Brooklyn by a brutal labor strike, sets out a number of story lines. Most include some of the most unwanted characters to walk across a movie screen. But the last exit to Brooklyn failed to reach these stories for any conclusion ... it leaves some of them hanging endlessly, or exploding in some strange Stratosphere to finish "Technician". <br /> <br /> Two cases at a point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> There is a melancholy sad character (an important figure in the film), shocked by a car and killed. That's all for him in the film .... I've gone for good, erased from everyone's memory ... no feedback from friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another subject the stupid, ignorant, and secretly gay strike leader, having refused to work, his gay lover, knowing by neighborhood thugs, gets trampled by thugs. The last scene of the beatings appears on the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lighting is very much like those in the Nazi death camps ... The scene goes on and on ... The camera moves to the body of the labor leader, and has been crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that's all for him too .... erase the brain ..... gone. <br /> <br /> The bottom line ... Regardless of what reviewers originally said in 1989 about this movie ... this movie is a piece of frustrating sludge. avoid it. If you are not warned in advance, it really deserves the NC-17 rating for huge amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... so do not let the teenagers watch you.
