With a budget of $ 30,000, this film still looks like it was made for $ 50. You can say from the first frame to the last that he did not care a bit about the continuity of films or plot, he was just happy to produce a zombie film. <br /> <br /> What the final result shows is a lazy film maker who likes zombie movies. It would have been wonderful if I had received care. The end result is the infinite magnification of poor gaps and even more bad metal production. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine great hopes, big dreams, decent budget, hard work, and the other idiot behind the camera.
