Western society has been fed with ideas about India as a poor country. Movies like these only make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it difficult for Indians to accept them abroad. It has been agreed that there are poor and displaced people in India, but why there is no representation of educated people if not successful. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the film that portrayed Patrick Sweezy as another Mother of Teresa. In my opinion, this film showed India in a very bad light giving the wrong concepts. It is unfair to discuss only one side of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we rent an elephant out of the airport directly so we do not have to walk on the porous roads and snakes?" <br /> <br /> For those who want to get a second opinion about contemporary Indian society, they should watch the "Monsoon Wedding".
