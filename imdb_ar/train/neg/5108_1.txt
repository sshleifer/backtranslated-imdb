I can only laugh at the people who praise this show as a grief and a tearful tear. For one, it is totally unrealistic for these people to live a perfect life after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford these new large houses? What about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must certainly increase after this happens. In addition, the noise will upset me. <br /> <br /> Second, how far is reality TV? It is practically the same as the repeated junk week after week. We have known a family that suffers, they renovate the house, and then they surprise the family and everyone breaks the Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the renovation part is. The only interesting part of this show is to know the shape of the house, but even this part is being destroyed by the phantom and persistent false sects. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a demo that pretends to be honest but drops. Skip this one. If you love reality television, the "Survivor" is superior and mobile.
