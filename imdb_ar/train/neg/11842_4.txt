Kristen Dunst is terribly overpriced as an actress. You can always say it's just "acting". I love Izard though. The plot is awfully boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, and he never knows who sympathizes or cares about him. The film is slow, boring, with some laughter, but a little and not very funny anyway. The plot is not engaging or suspicious at least. You can see every plot turn a mile away. What is this movie supposed to be? comedy? drama? who cares? You will not end this movie.
