Although William Shater can always make me smile at anything he shows (and I especially like him as Denny Crane at Boston Legal), well, this show is about glitz and dancing girls and yelling and jumping up and down. <br /> <br /> He does not have the intelligence of a millionaire, and has no taste of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and dumb things that need to be filled in time. <br /> <br /> I've seen it, of course, just to check it out. I watched it for more than 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part of it was William Schattner dancing on stage. He shouted! Unfortunately, this offer will not make it. <br /> <br /> This is given
