Before watching "Dahmer", I thought that no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To summarize "Dahmer", it's a story about a gay serial killer that includes almost no killing, and consists almost entirely of Dahmer encounters with gay men before being killed. There is no plot to be found, and serves no purpose as much as telling us anything about "Dahmer". All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he likes to have sex with men. Terrible acting, horrible output, terrible writing, all terrible ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and vomiting a shell for three hours, go with vomiting .... it will be less painful .....
