This is the worst film I have ever seen. Let me say it again: this is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It contained all the hallmarks of a bad film: continuity errors, bad writing, bad representation, poor production value, bad music. I thought there were a few points for horror movies. The first is that it is supposed to be suspicious enough to scare you. This film gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to her, we are supposed to care about her. This movie gets F in this regard as well. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is exposed to wolves after she fears this will happen to her. The following story, the obsessive-compulsive man dies of not being careful and speaks to his dead friend. Oh, and then, there's a terrifying story of his roommate. Come on, can you choose more interesting and a little common themes of being alone at home, being a barbarian, and having a roommate? All these stories show hallucinations, and the virtual reality of a doctor who uses it himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something to you. I enjoy watching horror movies and laughing over how bad they are. I could not do this with this one. It was a great pain to sit and watch. Not under any circumstances watch this movie. You will regret it.
