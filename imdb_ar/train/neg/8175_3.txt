The mood of this film is very good and it reflects the feeling of the 1980s with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The mill script is run except for a few comic moments and comes as strange as I expect it to be edgy. The characters have ended dramatically and are filled with right-wing clich√©s that the scriptwriter might have seen in a panoramic documentary on the FN. The biggest problem is that this film has no real story. All "arty" boxes are marked on the right, but nothing really happens and in the end you leave the question behind. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
