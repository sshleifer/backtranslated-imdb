I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious when I saw Michael Madsen appear in a film I had never heard of before, but it was a fast film, so why not examine it. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Mr. Blond desperately wishes to forget that he ever participated in such a shame of the film. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if the script and dialogues are awesome, even good actors can not save today. Not to mention the amateur actors that are immersed in this film. Many English-speaking non-native speakers play parts of the English-speaking community, reading a string of script that should have been left without being turned into a movie. It's unbelievable how incredible all the lines are in the sound of the film. The music is awful and totally non-existent, and the whole thing sounds like a bad school play. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you watch them completely so you can appreciate other films better. That's why I gave it 3 instead of the one it deserves.
