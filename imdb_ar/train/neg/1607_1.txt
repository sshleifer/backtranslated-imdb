This "documentary" is evidence of the use of talent for medium purposes. The fact that the Venezuelan government finances them gives them illegitimacy to look for the truth of what actually happened in those terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something we do not even know, certainly, Venezuelans. <br /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the managers of these things lie in neglect and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is so complex that foreign audiences can not easily understand it and benefit from it. For example, the potential spoilers show the pro-Chavez demonstrators shooting in an empty street (what the hell did they do for it?) In a way they say they did not kill anyone, but they did not bother to show the pictures we all saw here, opposition protesters ) Fall dead or wounded on the other side of this "empty" street. Can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one licensed to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against snipers that were on rooftops near the presidential palace, which would show incompetence. Security measures to guard the president. A few days after the "coup," the head of the National Guard (National Congress) was asked why they did not act against snipers. "Because they were not there to work against the president," is not that a confession? <br /> <br /> There is a lot, the fact that the highest military rank announced that Chavez resigned, and two days later he said he lied because "this is the policy" and at present is the Minister of Internal Affairs under Chávez's administration. <br /> <br /> It will take me thousands of words to explain all the lies described in this "documentary," made for the sale of the good old Hugo Chávez, who governs the poor and the poor, rich opposition you want at all costs, while the truth is that 60 to 70% of people reject his government, including the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope that those who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version being created by a group of Venezuelan people showing at least 30 falsehoods. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
