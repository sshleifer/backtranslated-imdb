This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars I've spent in a very long time. If you know how many times you've gone to movies you might say, it's hard to imagine, but that's never true! After seeing the trailer for this film, I knew I had to watch it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why not? The trailer is no less interesting and exciting. Unfortunately, the film does not represent any of these things. <br /> <br /> From film to screenplay to acting, this film flops completely. If you read this, you plan to go to the movie expecting some excitement, ambiguity, movement, horror or anything else that is not wasted for an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you're disappointed. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you might ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor impressive. Nothing about the film made me less something "on the edge" or "scared or curious". The script was at best funny. There were several times during the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous and I began to dismiss it as a comic joke only to discover a few seconds later that it was not. The acting was absolutely horrible. I love Nicolas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this film was incredibly mediocre. Filming was awful with no one moment of suspense or mystery. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie one mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a harsh critic. Honestly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, ill-behaved, bad writing, and very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
