If Hitler ever appeared again, it would be partly because of this nonsense, which spreads a ridiculous notion that he was crazy from the start. Far from pursuing such a person and electing him to the highest position on the earth, wise men crossed the street to avoid him, and he would die in a trench, nameless and anonymous. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads the stories of companions close to Hitler - the biography of his secretary Traudl Jung, for example - will be surprised by the fact that people have found him gentle, generous and generous. He was also a great preacher, the fact that his speeches seemed exaggerated and mocked to modern ears that ignored the times when the strutting was common in political speeches. As was previously overstated anti-Semitism, which was not the central plank of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - neither uncommon nor unusual for times. Makes the film seem as if Hitler's only ambition from the very beginning is the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person that will cause the deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore the crows protectors of the life depicted here. Instead, look for a charming, attractive man whose inspirational speeches inspire the entire nation, and the country benefits from his political work in tangible and material terms. I'm afraid his character like Barack Obama is more than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping so much here, and I got nothing but a caricature. The fools who committed this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of Reefer Madness.
