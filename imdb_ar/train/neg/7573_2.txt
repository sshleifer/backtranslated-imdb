This film is a way for Schwarzenegger to reproduce Alexander Nevsky. However, his appeal is not enough to raise this film above its weak text. He has little to add to his Arnie law. <br /> <br /> Michael York is pathetic just like a beggar diplomat. Watching him look at D'Artagnan-Act from the time he was a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and unexplained relations. The top part of this law is the lab of Vlad, who looks like an American woman, but from the context he seems to be working for a Russian government administration. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place after the end of the communist regime, all Russian characters still look very communist. In contrast, Vlad is allowed to drive a compact car into a police car. Motion scenes were filmed poorly and lacked dynamics. <br /> <br /> The movie should not be seen ...
