William S. Hart (Cage Train), a more qualified bachelor at Canyon City, finally tied up, to a beautiful blonde waitress for Leona Houghton (like Molly Stewart). His fianc√©e does not know that, but Mr. Hart is secretly the "wanted" gang in the western city. However, Hart plans to go directly, because of his marriage plans. Unfortunately, Mrs. Hutton discovers Hart's secret hiding place while cleaning his uncluttered compartment; therefore, she cancels the wedding. After that, Hutton surrenders to the magic of crook Mining Frank Porsage (like W. Sloan Curry). <br /> <br /> Entertainment can be provided by the star of Hart; he won first place at the box office, by Quigley Publications, from 1915 to 1916 (ahead of Mary Beckford). Principles perform efficiently. Later, Frank Borsage was a way out. And Leona Hutton, suicide ... <br /> <br /> *** A Knight of the Trails (8/20/15) William S. Hart ~ William S.
