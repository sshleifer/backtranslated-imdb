Daniela has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior. She begins to lose her mind when she is soon discovered (like him) burned for being a wolf. She is a bit angry when she breaks the men and removes their throats. In the end she finds a man who helps contain her internal monster, but when others destroy the bliss, her violent and angry revenge is extracted. <br /> <br /> "Werewolf Woman" is not a very thin film, but it is a good crowd film. There can be a good time by tossing bad play / dubbing / translation and simple cheese production. But on his own he moves slowly but has a wide nudity to keep you barely awake.
