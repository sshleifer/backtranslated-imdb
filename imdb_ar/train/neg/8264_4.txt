It is a film in which the actors are fine, especially Brigitte Baku and Eric Paladino, in a film in which each of the three couples meets in a position where the other person is forced to be pleasant or to start the story in motion. In other words, it looks like a fake film scene, not like real life. Even if the women who work in pitches go out with one of their clients, it does not seem realistic at all as written in this film. Also, when a character meets a woman with extra weight in the film, she looks artificial, the way she looks every second after the argument. Again, the actors are all good, and the moments of this film are nice, but in general, there is another character that can use some rewriting before starting production.
