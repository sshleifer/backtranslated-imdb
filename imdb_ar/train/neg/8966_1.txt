The original "Cube" is a wonderful B movie that goes with paranoia, meaty characterization, and great shows. It's creepy, hidden, and cool. It stands well, on its own, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third film (!) in the Cube series is part of a new (most of the traps are recycled sadly) and partial deviation. It takes a bold step to explain what the cube is - something that has never been revealed in the first film - but because the explanation is nice, it has been kept secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the community outside the cube, but they never develop except for hints about a kind of religious political tyranny. So, what is the little social commentary that feels unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. Representation is a purely amateur hour, slow speed (consisting of the amount of this film of two maniacs watching a screen?), The enormous effects, while rebelling, fail to persuade. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of stealing "Cube", a filthy clone and a sumuric for a good film that certainly does not need to be supplemented.
