Yes, The Southern Star features a well-forgotten title sung by this heavy crook Matt Monro. It largely defines the tone of this rather overbearing and boring feature, staggering with George Segal and Ursula Andres as a couple adventurous in search of great diamonds. Add "Harry Andrews" (in a strange tone, no less) than chasing an ostrich, tons of stock footage of wildlife, a very bad and rude portrayal of Raul Coutard, ending up with an amazingly inaccurate jungle across Senegal.
