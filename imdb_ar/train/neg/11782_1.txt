The Danish film Slim Slam Slum surprised me to be the worst film I have ever seen. I did not think it could have topped the list of bad bad movies, but this movie deserves gold. Not funny. It's bad, filmed badly and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is having three girls in it. I really think that this click has the ability to hit the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish film ever! This is really nothing. Congratulations in advance!
