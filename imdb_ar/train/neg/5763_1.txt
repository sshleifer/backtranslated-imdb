<br /> <br /> "Put aside Hollywood veterans?" (The Waians were asked) This is what hollyweird asked and that is what happened. However, like many of his recent decisions, this decision was a grave mistake. <br /> <br /> The manager away from the public today, trying to recover the physical impurities and pennies instead of the funny dialogue, a disaster. I knew that, and the public knew it and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why have they never thought of changing managers? Not only that, but the brothers and Ian played a role among four basic characters, without which it was only a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
