Many other reviewers here, including many who respect their views, carry this bit of horror with European corruption with great respect. Personally, I did not like it at all. In an incoherent attempt at the atmosphere between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very good. Unfortunately, the famous film director Joe Damato does not. D'Amato's most famous films are notorious for their gross total. This, an early film by him, does not contain the continuing disgusting scenes of his film "Anthropophos" and "Beyond the Darkness". In the end, it is an incoherent film that does not succeed in engaging the viewer in any way. Without a corrupt worker, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this film, but I found it to be just an ideal example of incredibly slow writing. <br /> <br /> There are some additional features of the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") in it, looks very hot and is often bare. However, the icon of the cult film Klaus Kinski is completely lost in a sub-chart without any connection to the main film. He seems to be bored of this role and does not have the manic intensity at his best. The result is nice music and there are some short moments of unintentionally funny gore. Still, this hummingbird movie is useless and can be incredibly boring. (10/3)
