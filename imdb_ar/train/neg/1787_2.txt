I loved Batman: dead end. The preparation of Batman's film Dark Light is perfect. Batman: A good dead end. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start by acting. None of this is really good. It is better to have Clark Bartram as Batman. But that does not say much. It's good at first glance, then you realize it's what it is, a bodybuilder that happens to be a potential actor. But the problem is basically that Batman does not belong to daylight, he looks like a stranger wandering around Bat's suit. Instead of a horribly rude man trying to make up for the mistakes of the past. Daylight also reveals annoying spoons on Bartram's face that never leave him and are indispensable in Batman: a cul-de-sac, perhaps because of a very desirable short darkness in this trailer. Bartram seems to imagine shaking his head and shaking stubbornly, it's not, it's just the opposite. It is called "assumption," something that real actors like the plague avoid. <br /> <br /> I did not understand a thing at all why Colora created body builders as leaders. It makes sense to give the role to a representative who can manage it, rather than a bodybuilder who can manage it, but it looks like a lot of comedy! Of course, it would probably have been better if they did not leave the Dialouge of Collora much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole stent (yes, trailer ... there will be a full length movie) focuses more about Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is tacky, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hairn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands around him, smiling, the lines say. That's about it. Although I am not surprised that he is just a bodybuilder who has appointed him and may have received some acting lessons. Again I say to Collora, casting actors. No Bodybuilding. The actors will be so much more urgent that we will tolerate the fact that they do not look exactly like the comic book. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you expect to be worn by Superman. As for the Batman suit. Well, I think it looks good in the dark. I say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you'll buy from the Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But this is not a good thing. These shots look especially amateurish. This and much of the entire "movie" seems to have been filmed in his yard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a snapshot of Superman catching a car in his hands. And the last shot of the two faces and Batman in the end. For those of you who saw the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now if he could extend that shot across the trailer. <br /> <br /> I finally ask. Why if you are trying to show your ability as an outlet, do you make a short video? This proves nothing when it comes to being a real way out. My only advice for Collora here is, there is a difference between being able to tell a story and being able to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End You did not feel like amateurs. I can not tell where this error occurred.
