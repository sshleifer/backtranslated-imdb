I know that some films (I mean European films), which are very bad films, are considered "great cinema" by some "critics," just because they are not American. I have seen the 8.1 IMDB result for this film and noted the fact that this was selected for some big festivals. Do not let this fool you! Unless you are one of those people who like such amazing films, and then call them great art, skip them! The film has a hilarious scene after another (a similar, Italian film, in my mind, PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE Terrible (Best Voice of the Sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only boring, like some other films that have been extraneously praised, but play as a camp. I mean, let's face it, terrible representation (I mean: level of soap opera), the story is not one surprise (it has been so endless times, and connect many storytelling: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAYING HEART, just much better) Not a single realistic character in it (some real strange seeing along the way, noticed a daughter like a hilarious zombie), and so on. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, the movie 135 minutes. (Counting!) For a long time, and in the end the director opens his ability to feel. After a movie with such a very bad dialogue and scenes that made the audience in the preview screen laugh at incompetence, well ... this is an insult to the cinema, and only receives high ratings because it happens in the "other" language, in this Spanish case. A strange world we live in. 3/10
