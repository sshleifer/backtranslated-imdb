This self proclaimed "very talented artist" easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of passion, consistency, rhythm, skills, humor ... Repeats the same position over and over again. Does not show the evolution of personality. No violent and / or sexy content appears, and adds nothing new to the subconscious killer's subtype. So it should appear lame in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in the first film. <br /> <br /> BTW where hell is "talent"? There are almost identical scenes; there are scenes of two or more main shots and it is very horrifying to watch the movement jump from one main shot to another for no reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. Actors who play major roles act like amateurs, barely supportive and hardly believable. There are more holes than the plot in the script (if there is one) ... <br /> <br /> A really frustrating film, and a talented director at all.
