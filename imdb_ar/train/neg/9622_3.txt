When I saw that this movie was showing on TV, I was looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980's and like anyone else who grew up in that era, he watched the film of every 80 camps in adolescence and summer camp there. So I could not wait to see this movie which completely spoils this kind of movies. What a disappointment!! The film was only a bunch of really bad jokes and blues over and over again, there was hardly any conspiracy or substance. The filmmakers are trying to make dark humor - some of these alleged jokes have come across nothing but harsh and humiliating. The only good things about this movie were wardrobe, music and acting. It was good to go on a trip to nostalgia and watch all the summer clothing styles of the eighties, and the same goes for music. The acting was everywhere: most of the Hollywood celebrities were present. Too bad they did not have the best material to work with.
