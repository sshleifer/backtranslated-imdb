This movie is one of the worst films of the year. The main characters do not have chemistry and representation is terrible. Paul Rod is the only one who has no talent, and the only one who is not annoying. I never saw Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria was in this show, but in this film it was awesome. It's like she does not know anything about acting. All of her characters are whine throughout the film, and she can not be full and still amused. The other girl, Lake Bill, shows a little emotion, as if you were looking at the cue cards as she read them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, they cut cookies. Go from point A to B with little surprise. Much could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have been spinning around and the things you were doing with a spirit. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Not worth watching.
