I saw this film because I love Nicolas Cage and Jida. I found it strange and totally useless ... so I decided to move a bit and get the copy of the 1970s. Wonderful. what is the different. The original version was better. I would like you all to know that it has already been made originally, its existence has had a purpose. The Christian public was truly expressing its fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it, you will also have comments on life, but I do not want to delve into the details, just, simply, if you are disappointed and want to know its shape, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but much better.
