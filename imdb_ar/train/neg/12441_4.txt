Some things need clarification. The picture of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris who starred in this film. I know that because it was my father. Please remove that image. Also, Marc Ferris was a writer, and at least one of them. I was trying to find a copy or a way to watch this movie again. Years have passed, and if someone can direct me to get a copy, that would be great. The film was not too bad, and an attempt to compare it to the world of Star Wars today and other superlative science fiction is worthless. If you're watching it, just enjoy it for the amazement and humor it has. You can make it easier for you to enjoy a movie and enjoy some less creative and innovative films.
