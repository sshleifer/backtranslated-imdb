Heinz and Geofforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin the wrong first step by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all his lines are intended to be taken seriously. This is simply not true. Wales was the heir to the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian complacency for the self might leave the British unprepared for the world that could produce new technology - both good and evil. <br /> <br /> Two are followed by dire consequences - the protagonist is portrayed as a cowardly scream (Fei Fei was mentioned in the original King Kong), instead of a man struggling to live outside the paradox of an incredible disaster; "Seriously that Welles was clearly meaning that his tongue be taken in cheek. <br /> <br /> All this seems suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget wasting on CGI effects - which was a very bad way. The Warner Bros. animation factory in the 1940s did a better job. (The scattered blood seemed like red balloons, I expected to float away at any moment.) Think of the Yellow Submarine as the old EC Comics did. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the loss of appearance, which steals the film from any reason to exist. Although the makers of this film return the story to its Victorian era, they miss the strange way that the story of Wales foreshadowed many of the horrors of World War I - a fact not noticed by Wales himself after the war, Will come. " <br /> <br /> Without any subject, all we have here is that a lot of people are running around in cartoon balloons, when they are not trying to produce a high school to rewrite a drunken student to Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the worst and most important part of the leadership group I have suffered since a friend spoke about seeing the cartoon of Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a very boring film. My friend and two strangers gave up the irony half way down, and we sat near the playing cards on the screen, using the film the light we see in the cards - his only benefit, as far as any of us can say. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this situation in the wells for anything. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie - steal every copy you can (do not pay cents) and burn each copy. God created us in His wisdom for this purpose only.
