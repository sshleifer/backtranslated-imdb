A traditional Italian movie dating back to the seventies, original and good music, but with some quirks, interesting but not great, is a poor and sometimes confusing story (like the role of a wolf dog, and where does the boy come from?). <br /> <br /> The reason why he is still (relatively) known and sought after is perhaps the bare scenes (including the pseudo-pseudo-model in the seventies) that includes an 11- and 13-year-old girl with an older boy Eva Ionescu and Laura Wendell) - It is interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these perceptions of young adolescents were accepted and normal in all Europe (and the United States) 30 years ago, while they are now more than taboos. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of one girl (Laura) through two other characters, and her discovery of sex, which is a very accurate representation of one aspect of adolescent life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not develop until the end of the film and she is already showing up in the dramatic arts - she has no "adulthood": she is a useless little girl who already knows her sexual charm, but eventually is used and ends the film crying like a little girl who Has already ceased. The boy is a very despicable bully, while Laura comes as a naive and very weak victim.
