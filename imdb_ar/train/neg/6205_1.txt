So they segregated the violence and described him as sick. Well, violence is the best I'm afraid of, but unfortunately the characters were not developed enough to allow us to understand why they are still in a frenzy (which is quite predictable). This film has a really scary script. We never got a chance to get to know Robert and his actions in the end are just pathetic. Acting is not much better, and the worst thing is the TV chef and school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace is sufficient to send you to sleep. What on earth is a movie project school everything? Comment on the film itself perhaps? Using the news bulletin during atomic killing is laughable. It is clear that these men think they are intellectuals but they lose their hopelessness. How they managed to weaken Yorgos Arvanitas on the ground, I will never know. And how they got the money to make it primarily a bigger mystery. Awful beyond comprehension.
