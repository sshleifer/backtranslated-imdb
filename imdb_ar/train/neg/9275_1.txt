Omen IV (1991) was badly made. Movie. Since the end of the 1980s, I think CEOs were experimenting with methyl (the drug of choice during the 1990s) because there is no other reason to explain this scarecrow. Why even bother making this? TV movie? What were they studying when this appeared on the idea plate? They even thought for a second that this movie would catch him. Maybe they thought it could make it a chain? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason why I did not buy the Omen Trio. They had to stop a few dollars instead of putting down this "extra" disk. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is essentially a remake of the American family from the first film. Instead of a baby punk nose, we get a spooky girl who is completely naughty for everyone around her. If the family has the strongest parenting skills, none of the demonic events that have appeared in previous movies will occur. These parents need to put their feet down and do some real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, it is best to avoid it at all costs!
