*** may contain spoilers. *** If living in Tokyo is a bold experience where real actors were given to want to be parts of the film provided they were asked to take a combination of a powerful anti-anxiety prescription, antidepressant medication, and antipsychotic medication (This is the classic narration of the psychic wing that makes patients suffer from zombie runny saliva) all during filming, and then this film will receive much more attention. Or, if the production of the film is another type of experiment where all actors were deprived of sleep before and during the shooting, TOKYO TIME can be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this film is filled with low-energy actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, he seemed to have trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene, he talks about his lines as he sits motionless. From start to finish, his facial expression is best described as "close to sleep". <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the actors who talk across each other's lines because those actors can barely end any lines of dialogue. Everyone is talking in a frustrated voice. No laughter. Do not scream. Do not force. No one has enough energy to wipe a smile. Result: full and full boredom. <br /> <br /> It does not help that the trend is simple and amateurish. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. It is best to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has magic and energy. Or, to get a non-traditional Japanese romantic story, check out the LONG vacations that contain a great deal of everything not live in Tokyo.
