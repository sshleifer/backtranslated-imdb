This was shown on the CV channel and was as much information as a comic for kids! I gave it 2 out of 10 because of the attention to detail because it was mostly felt, and the three ladies who played the three original angels were like them so the make-up was good. This biography was supposed to be on the CV channel, but it was free of all that is usually seen in one of their biographies. There are no interviews with surviving team members, crew members, production team members, etc., or with their friends and family and any CV of these persons. In fact, I now know about the program as much as I know before I watch this film, which was based on the supposed biography. As for learning something that no one knew about the program and good public knowledge never happened.
