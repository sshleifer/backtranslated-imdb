At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is very exciting and thought-provoking. Of course, when something stimulates thought, it can then be scrutinized. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with unfounded hints and conclusions. The link "What will make him bleep ..." you may see between science and spirituality, in fact, is not rooted in science at all. The study of Transcendental Meditation mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a particular area, Washington DC in this case. In fact, the rate of HRA crimes (murder, rape and assault) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was no drop in the murder rate during the study. In fact, all claims linking metaphysics to science have been exposed. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of this information is that this movie is either a bad attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Either way, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long film about science that can evoke thoughts, you may think of Mindwalk (1990).
