I absolutely love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this poor presentation by the Troma people made no sense and I had yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A nuclear plant leaking (and growing growth) herbs next to it) makes the Tromaville High Junior fracture, making them join a gang, have sex, explode, and whatever. Also there is a kind of breeding monster in high school ... oh my god, this movie is in a mess. <br /> <br /> Representatives have largely stopped their efforts after this and must. I started exaggerating (intentional) to influence my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 10/02.
