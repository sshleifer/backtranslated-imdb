"Dahmer" is an interesting film although I will not use "horror" or "excitement" described. It is more than a simple personal study that seems sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Reiner depicts serial killer Jeffrey Dummer, who anesthetizes and kills his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", played well by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is the most interesting character: he adores Dahmer and after surviving the attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is unbreakable because it does little to portray the years of Dummer's formation, and how events may have created the human beast we see on screen and do not give insight into a belief that has been destroyed that could create a sexual coma for its victims. <br /> <br /> The roles are played well but the story is thin.
