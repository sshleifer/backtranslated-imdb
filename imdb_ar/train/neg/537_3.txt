I went to see the "evening" because of the cast. I went to see the Norman Room for this reason - the film features Diane Keaton, Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as Merrill Streep - and I loved it every minute. The same for the "Notebook" although it was light. My feeling was that anything that offered Vanessa Redgrave, Merrill Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Claus would be good at least. Instead, I have sometimes found that the greatest actors can not overcome simple and vulgar material - and on one occasion - really offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now, I did not have a problem with how the movie was organized. I really enjoy the movies that go back and forth in time to tell a story ... as long as the light illuminates the other and the verse. But while Vanessa was on her deathbed and remembered a previous event she felt was "wrong", sometimes the part that actually appeared was the "past mistake" did nothing to make it clear. In fact, it makes no sense in "a girl meets a boy, a girl becomes a boy, a girl loses a boy," and in the most authoritative, vulgar, wrong way possible. <br /> <br /> Here are the spoilers, so keep in mind that you should keep reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danis was brutally accused. Not only does she start up resembling Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nowhere near the pieces when it comes to acting. Do not get me wrong, they can be good in the right role - not only this role. Patrick Wilson was incorrect, although he had the representative pieces to pull almost. He was more suited to the role played by Hugh Dancy - the rich and confused - and not the subject of sexual attraction for one person; he was too little WASP-Y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I'm drunk and tortured and wait until you find out why." And "why" (I am a wardrobe in a world that has been sexually suppressed, so I have to drink too much and obscure myself in front of everyone I know) was very insulting to me and the way he died (as you know he will because that is the only thing that can happen) Homosexual in the fifties) ridiculous and wrong heads and mismanagement, has thrown candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> A recent part of Tony Colette and her sister, her fear of commitment, and jealousy of her "perfect life for her sister," her sister wonders if she has made the right choices, carrying her and her very ideal friend (which may have been more exciting) Interesting and important if played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebony Moss Bashrash, Harris was more interesting, given his dreamy eyes) - however, all this was fragmented in the 1970s and 1980s. And much deeper. Should we introduce it, again, and everything as if it were new and a scientist? <br /> <br /> To the highest level, Meryl Streep does not appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in the makeup of an old lady that hides many of her facial expressions. She's still good, but just because she's Meryl, Meryl can find a way to beat even the hottest dialogue under the heaviest make-up. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film contains all the cliches in the book "A Message Is Really Meaningful" and adds a few books that have never been revealed. In two long hours and decorated with "Lifetime Movie-of-of-music" music that ensures you are fascinated by it, it is a complete failure in both "purposeful" and "filmmaking" aspects. I give it number "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all your movies need is twadd le, please set my comments about "Evening" aside and customize your life time. But if you want to have a truly meaningful experience presented by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life, death and all that nonsense, rent a Norman Room and discover what a truly wonderful representation is.
