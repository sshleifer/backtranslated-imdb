The shooting crew did not have a good chance of reaching the occupied territories. I was shocked by the views of very close mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the potential for a life of immense happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only a chance to be deprived and despair. With completely different views, no meeting had a real opportunity for any meeting of minds. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for the Israelis was security. With such a cliff, is this kind of film worth much? I ended up feeling that I had seen meaningless propaganda - both sides were unconvinced.
