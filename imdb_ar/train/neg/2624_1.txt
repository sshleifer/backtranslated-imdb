To say this stinky movie would be an insult to the skunk. As the other commentator puts it, this film offends anyone over the age of 7 (especially as they are incredibly gay). It's terrible - not in a way that's "too bad it's funny" too - it's just horrible. No, I must say it: it's difficult! (Sorry the skunk). <br /> <br /> From opening credits to final titles, there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the characterization does not exist, and the representation is more than stolen from the top "Look at me I'm funny!" The school thus goes on. The pieces are set clumsily (if any) and poorly executed, it's just awful on every interface - apart from the music maybe, I do not remember thinking about the stink of music (apart from the songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to manufacturers, they put their papers on the table very quickly: the opening credits include the title "Ertha Kitt starring also as Betty the meteor" (since the meteor in question never appears at all, Occasional chatter from time to time may have raised Kate's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the film runs something like: "... and the scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your Anal" geddit? geddit? Hey? Huh ?? Your anus? Humor is really cheap. <br /> <br /> You say strange things about "comedy" at that time because the hero was absolutely allowed to shoot a dead baptist on the street but did not say "sh * t" loudly. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel separated.
