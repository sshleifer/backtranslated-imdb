Skippy plays "Family Ties" as Eddie, an eccentric "metal" student of his choice. When the dead metal "silent" singer, Sammy Corr, dies, he throws a hysterical fit that tears all the posters on the wall of his bedroom. But when he later gets an undeclared record bearing the spirit of his "mineral" idol. He has been driven to revenge, but he does not want to take it as much as Sami does. This is not the extent to which its main victims appear to be in hospital. This movie is completely ridiculous and has something to do with almost real minerals such as "Rock Star". Well, maybe a boy over that unwanted piece, but you get my point. And how can anyone get out of a man who plays Skype from Family Links? I have no idea. The engraving of Jane Simmons is fine, and Ozzi reaches Osborne to coherence, and I salute it, but otherwise skip this. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets naked, extra nudes at a pool party
