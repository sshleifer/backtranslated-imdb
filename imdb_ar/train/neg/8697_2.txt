Carnosaurus 3: Primitive Species (1996) D. Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Jen, Rick Dean, Anthony Beck, Rodger Halston, Terry Jay Vaughn, Billy Burnett. Why would you even want to review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur discovers the top secret military men of these deadly (and very fake) monsters revolving around killing people in their great ways. The original was bad enough and the sequel was even worse. This is somewhere in between, although it is not associated with any of the previous Carnosor movies. Rating: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, graphics, horrific images and profane words.
