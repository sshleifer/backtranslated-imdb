Filled with fine actors, I expected much more than the "deceitful" of what was delivered. The plot is very fabricated and manipulative. Many past memories add only to confusion. The fly flies through the window and with the end it becomes intolerable and ridiculous. I would strongly recommend anyone who loves his cinematic plots to rely on something possible at least to avoid "deception" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm not just in the groin to get this, but my suspicion is that many others were puzzled by the story story and especially at the end. The blurred line between reality and lies simply does not work because the whole film makes no sense. - Merck
