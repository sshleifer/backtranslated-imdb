Sakura's killers (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987, this movie would have looked great ... if you have never seen a good movie of ninja ever. Cheesy 's music ... and the sequences of martial arts. The coolest scene at first ... with old Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... many ninja dressed in black sneak on him and seem bent on hitting the ball to notice him suddenly got into his golf bag and ... naw, I will not spoil it for you If you feel bad to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videos or something. A handful of weak Caucasian heroes are trained on ninja roads because "only ninja can fight ninja" or something like that. Strangely enough, these men do not seem to fight better after their training than before ... Well, the film moves very quickly. The fighting scenes may not be great .. but they are plentiful ... and sound effects are overpriced for a few chuckles.
