The highlight of all social evil is the result of patriarchy and male dominance, no matter how irrational this logic is. But within the film's story and theme, there is no gray area and the woman that should be called the movie competition, is the "villainous story." Under what circumstances what could be justified. The sexual activity of women is just a noise in this case and has nothing to do with the truth. It is a betrayal of the final kind. The man ended up spending his resources and time on the extravagant extravagance of another man's offspring. Moreover, the weakest arguments raised by the three "liberated" female figures at their height were pathetic. Women's sexual needs are not an excuse for them to commit adultery and betray her husband constantly and worse, there are no other children. So in essence he lost his life. In some societies where justice still prevails, such cases lead to the execution of the oppressor.
