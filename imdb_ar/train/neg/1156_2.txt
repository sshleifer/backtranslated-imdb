Watching the tenants was a pleasant experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen, moving quickly in parts of motion - and I can usually see anything from frivolous motion films to Croatian Croatian indie and find it fascinating. <br /> <br /> Tenants are frustratingly slow and overly co-ordinated. One of the main problems of the script is that there is little real dialogue for the characters, apart from the specific parts where the characters "collide" in a very structured framework (to make this work, the film needs to feel more concepts, which did not happen). This leads to the lack of real personal development. Everyone seems to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even worse is the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. I found his description very uncomfortable and very unpopular. At one point I stopped the film because I was deeply disturbed by the delivery of aggressive, violent and monotonous character, and the absence of any other personal layer, regardless of the "operational" switch (which can really be predicted after a while) and I strongly wanted to have some ransom qualities. However, one of the reasons behind this jar may be the blurry timeline of the film (supposed to be in its seventies, it seems and seems almost more). If it was repaired more safely in the 1970s, his personality may seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> The movie's lighting was also embarrassing. Along the way, soundtracks are trying to create a gaudy, jazz-filled atmosphere that has yet to come, largely because the group was well lit. <br /> <br /> For tenants, for me an incredible film. It does not portray real people or suggest any interesting ways to think about the race, identity, or life of the writer, be it white or black. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I felt a sense that this project needed David Lynch. His appearance and his strange and troubling feeling raised both actors and text to something very remarkable.
