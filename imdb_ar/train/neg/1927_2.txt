(Potential spoilers) <br /> <br /> One of them once asked Dr. Sous whether they could secure the rights to the movie in his classic 1957 Christmas film, how Grinch stole Christmas. He rejected them, insisting that no one could do better than the great Chuck Jones TV since 1966 (perhaps in his mind too, perhaps his bitter experience in screenwriting for The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T) in 1953. When Dr Saleh in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, stubbornly refuses to sell the rights of the film. But with the widespread use of CGI effects, Ms. Geisel has become a variable. Universal made a generous offer to accept him; she also accepted molding Jim Carrey as a title character. She was supposed to be satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Giselle, who makes one of us. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded a budget of $ 123 million (more than the cost of Heaven's Gate, including inflation adjustment), which obviously went to the exact structure, specific design and special effects (undermined by <br /> < br /> to some extent due to fairly blurry cinematic photography). Unfortunately, none of these funds seem to have been allocated for a better scenario than what Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman (authors of Roger Arpit Framing) have written, making it better to use a <br /> <br /> budget High. While the TV was private for 26 minutes without ads, this movie attempts to fill a 105-minute runtime with more background information about Grinch. It turned out that, as a child, he was ridiculed, including a particularly humiliating experience at Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that harms our poor Mr Greensh is the direct cause of who they are. The problem lies in that it looks like a very long 105 minutes with a lot of dead wood that clogs the story. This may not sound so bad if Grinch is just a little more ... well, Greenshi. The character, written by Dr. Suss and Chuck Jones later on, was a malignant fox animation that undermined his slow attempts to hijack the holiday season because of his sudden change (and exponential growth) of the heart. Carrey's Grinch is a high-activity, high-activity sandal, and sometimes a slayer, while on holiday, "Cheermeister", crushes Whoville Square amid outrage <br /> <br /> (Hopefully the scenery looks as beautiful as it seems). This undermines the text's attempt to make Grinch more sympathetic, with both mania in Whoville being very sympathetic (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> The vision of Whoville of Dr. Seuss is a small town inhabited by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The film's Whoville site is a noisy and somewhat crowded place populated by corrupt, selfish and mad guides. A clear attempt to comment on US consumption. This is an aggressive attack <br /> <br /> Hypocritical since the film industry benefited greatly from American consumption, and as this film contributed to this huge advertising campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The movie expands and redefines Cindy Lo's character, a small but ultimately crucial character. The two-year-old innocent Lev, who entered into this phantom Santa, became bigger and wiser, constantly questioning the wrong values ​​of mania and trying to understand the view of Grinch (her main sight is re-activated from the original, making it look of character). She seems to be the only one who knows that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, making her a completely different and more disturbing character. <br /> <br /> Those who are celebrating Christmas must quickly accept a mass of coal in their socks. On the morning of December 25th, a copy of this long, tedious and tedious attempt to turn pigs . Classic in a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, and manipulation <br /> <br />, and cruelty are insufficient alternatives to magic, intelligence, sincerity and heart. People in Universal must kneel on their collective knees. Thankfully, this terrible bomb, worth $ 123 million, has achieved $ 260 million locally, or they will not be here today. Moreover, it has made Mike Myers cat in the hat possible!
