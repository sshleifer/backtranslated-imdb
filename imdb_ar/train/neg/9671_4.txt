Maybe I'll give 6 or 7 to this publicity film because it shows when and how the publicity film becomes successful. If there are people who see this piece and believe that "Well, the Jews must have done something to treat it the way they were treated in World War II." Then the film was made very cleverly to hide "why" and how to mix the right mix and wrong observations about How people live. What more can a propaganda film aim for? The part where an American film about the Rothschild family is being reused is very clever here, for example. The question was not asked why the Jew kept his wealth from the officer. No one mentions the tax system within that particular social class. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the level of arousal (or level of disgust) in the film slowly increases and matches the end of the film, which is similar to the objective solution and the necessities of advertising. Will leave the audience with joy and gratitude for the coming times ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that deals with the basic emotional perception of the audience. The film is a kind of history today, so you do not have to focus too much on it. However, in such simple words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer can find the importance of cultural hatred, violence and civilizational civilization today as well as problems of integration. Overall, fine garbage.
