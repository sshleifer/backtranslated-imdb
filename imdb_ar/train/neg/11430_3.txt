Well, let me put a new word here: fear: fear of multiple relationships. This is another thing in a long series of movies that start to incite the masses around the kind of trio, just to run a dime and preach about how it is so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monolithic solution. There is one person out of every thousand people who understands the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: A few decades from now, fear phobia will become as great as fear of homosexuals, but do you guess who would have known it? Right the first time: producers of this film. Many people like them. Why even make a kind of ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned movies like this? Proud of being immensely open to homosexuals, he completely ignores the fact that we live in an era where monogamy is transformed into monogamous marriage, which in turn turns into swings and polygamous marriages. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a silent silent mutant. (But, damn, I must say, Heather Graham is the best thing alive.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
