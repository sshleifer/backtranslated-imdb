What exactly happened during World War 11 in New Zealand when US troops were there? <br /> <br /> This horrific story of four sisters was truly pitiful to show. Can you imagine the casting of Joan Fontaine as the older sister of Sandra de? Fontaine looked like her mother. It was more entertaining that Fontaine became pregnant in the film. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Neumann, who had shown great success in screen chemistry after four years in The Hustler, did not have scenes in this film. Laurie plays the role of another sister who goes to Wellington to roam there, although she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons' widow and find a friendship with Paul Newman. There is even a love story for the young miss here. <br /> <br /> The picture is meaningless. Are they trying to say that everything is just in love and war? If they did, they did a poor job selling it. <br /> <br /> Conflict of interest is quickly eliminated with Newman and Simmons. This should have been done quickly for this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
