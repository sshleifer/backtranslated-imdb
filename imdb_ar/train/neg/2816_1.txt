This is one of those movies you see in a video store which you just have to get them because they look very bad. Indeed, we were unable to address most of them. There were a lot of quick redirects. <br /> <br /> But after that, we came across a scene where Robert Englund, the female protagonist, lured her name (her name slips somehow in my mind at this time). Crepes. I have never seen a single scene from a movie many times (I estimate forty or so). He never made me laugh in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show off his loins. I watched the movie last time two months ago, but I can not stop laughing while writing. In any case, the scene is a set of shots - Englund tears the underwear of the girl, Englund riding a familiar horse, while a mysterious woman drops the head of a snake. This is an absolute genius. You have to see it yourself.
