This film turns down from the fourth to the first without bothering the third or second, as it moves the gears to the final finish line of movie B. The first con is the best and smartest part of the movie. This is worth watching. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub happens very quickly, you may miss. Definitely not worth every ballyhoo given by Robert Osborne in the introduction to TCM for this bad to mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this marginal society are supposed to turn into saints - especially the unreasonable personality, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
