This movie was okay but could have been much better. There are some scary moments, but there is not enough of them to make me want to watch this movie again. There are some scenes that can progress quickly through and do not miss anything. The biggest drawback is that it is highly predictable, which is why I categorized it too low. It's great but do not expect anything great.
