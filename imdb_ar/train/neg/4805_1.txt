I loved Adrian Carey before this show. I thought it was a fantastic top-model and was really happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a wonderful guy. But this show just made me sick! I am very angry at Monday because of what happened in this show. I do not care that they were different in age, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrian, you've been together for only seven months. It did not surprise me at all that he did not suggest. I do not see an appeal to force someone to marry you before it's ready. If it's supposed to be, why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, let it come naturally? The conversion of the wedding ring into a ball and chain was not absolutely necessary, it is obviously stupid that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, you shame on her rivers and suggest them anyway! I've been through failed marriages, how can you rush into another just because they put a spell? I hope the relationship will continue, but I really feel that the marriage has been for the wrong reasons. Perhaps they can now take a breath and find the right reasons for marriage within marriage.
