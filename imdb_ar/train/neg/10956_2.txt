I bought this movie from the Gamestop movie box that the opponent used and caused me to laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is lagging behind and used like ten different monkeys in the entire film barely look alike. Not to mention they are using a double trick, which is just a short man wearing a costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey character. <br /> <br /> The director probably committed suicide with chimpanzees after the film first appeared in a preview of some Warner Bros. movies. The other with low rent and it ended up because of the money to the studio. Nor does it help that he was not infamous for his terrible task, and was not even known to have produced a disturbing film. <br /> <br /> Why is this film made at all?
