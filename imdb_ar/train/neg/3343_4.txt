An interesting story about a soldier in a war is missing the life of a young girl from the enemy and inhabits this event, although he saved many other captive children. The soldier is now a high school teacher run mostly by policemen patrolling corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. High school is a prison and most children pay little attention to their teachers or their manager. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides he will leave teaching and enter another field. However, the Director requests that the separation of detention be his last duty as a teacher. It is at this stage of the film when all hell breaks down and the story becomes a complete bomb. Try to enjoy it if you decide to show it!
