This film was bad at worst: never bothered. You did not care what happened in the plot; you did not care about the characters. Everyone was devoid of heart. I ended up getting out about 45 minutes because I simply did not want to subdue it. There is a lot of sex in the film. Sex can be okay. The film can be made (here Karma Sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or exciting. It was just ugly. Do not see this movie.
