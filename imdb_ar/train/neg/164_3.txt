I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but I was looking forward to it. I have been interested in the prescriptions of the institution, its submerged design, and technology with hard edges compared to the trips we used to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything interesting in this pilot. I found this plot wrapped and confusing. <br /> <br /> I will admit that I loved some of the evolution of personality - images of humans as a "teenager" ready to overcome her beauty. <br /> <br /> Vulcan Pep had one of a wonderful rack. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I will deal with this series. <br /> </ 3>
