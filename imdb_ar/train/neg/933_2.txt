A story that is undeveloped / incredible, (by the time I discovered where I was, I no longer care) the bad story. (Come on ... William Messi as a successful man ???) Bad guidance, (Do you have never seen Tracy Ullman perform poorly?) (Was I supposed to care about what happened to the non-committal character, John Ritter ?) Bad text ... (really, I'm not looking for a text version but this was really terrible) The only really good thing is the baby. Ten lines? Is it okay if your comment is less than ten lines? Com on - Who are these? Why can not I say what I should say in less than 10 lines ?? Is not this kind of arbitrary? Why is it okay to have less than 10 lines of suspension?
