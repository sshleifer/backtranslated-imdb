Three low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, break up burglaries late at night. They flee, but they quickly cross with the police who happen to be in pursuit of a terrorist. Of course, the police mistake the thief's band against the terrorist, the real terrorist escapes, the thieves have to resort to a small dive in a bar, take the hostages, and do not understand why the police intended to arrest them. And guess who else has chosen the bar as a haven for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? at all. The hill falls from there. Spacey has a great deal of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Fay Donaway, Gary Sines, Vigo Mortensen, Emmet Walsh, but they are all lost. Mostly because after all the characters in the bar get stuck, all they do during the remainder of the film is the argument. Without end and without purpose. Long before the film ended, I stopped giving damn what was happening to them.
