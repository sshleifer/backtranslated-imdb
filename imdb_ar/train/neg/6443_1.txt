I was one of the few non-liberals who came to watch Steve's video. It was a great experience ... in the making of propaganda films and boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the film would be a real documentary about Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but turned out to be another liberal effort to try to kill conservatives and the local religious community. Surely it seems useful for a filmmaker to make a documentary that reflects only his prejudices about the issues. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is to see all 10 voices published by his home here. Did they even watch the video? Julie J. Batman, this must be in line with all the President's men! Their ratings are as clear as bias in this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, like the accumulation of sounds in IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my voice will help to balance this.
