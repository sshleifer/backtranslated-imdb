I was always very impressed with Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman so when Sci-Fi showed this movie, I had to see it. I was very disappointed. It's a Wonder Woman by name only. She does not wear the right outfit [she must have rejected or asked for major changes] and the plot acts like James Bond's poor man. There are none of the things that made the comic book hero successful any supernatural power or specific will. Bad dream, I do not think Cathy is attractive anyway. I will not waste your time in this.
