I have to admit that I suspended this, thinking that something should happen, along with the dead body in the first scenes ... and get rid of it. I was wrong. It was the reality of the movie Hits House on the beach covered for the first part by Mordant Morphin. I do not really care what the ladies who are from Scotland these days do, who proves them, and what medications they eat. Visually, a stroll through Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was enjoyable and definitely excellent for me. Nader was a stamp shop for her dead friend. When the film approached my end I had two ideas ... 1. Is that all there? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed herself. Name it. "Naked bare boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I like a sucker to take out these things.
