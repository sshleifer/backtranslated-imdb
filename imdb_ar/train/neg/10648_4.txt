Conclusion The films of Weissmuller Tarzan are a fairly weak story. There are some things that hinder this movie off track. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends most of the film wearing elastic sandals. In my opinion, any shoes on Tarzan, whether sandals or shoes as sometimes filmed, take away the personality that is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Second, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous publication, completely exits the movie for the comic. For me, his character is not necessary to plot the film. <br /> <br /> Also, while Vissem√ºller still relegates a leading figure like Tarzan, he is clearly not at his best. Although in his recent films Jungle Jim, his fitness has improved somewhat from this film. <br /> <br /> The Battle of the Octopus is a wonderful idea, but I think it should have been done in a former Weissmuller movie when it was at its physical height. Similarly, the battle, which takes only thirty seconds from the top, will be more exciting if pulled from 90 seconds to two minutes, such as the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and his companion. <br /> <br /> Brenda Joyce as Jean and Linda Cristian in the role of Mara, who are overwhelmingly satisfied, are not succeeding in saving this last film of Weissmuller - a disappointing ending in a fascinating series of characters.
