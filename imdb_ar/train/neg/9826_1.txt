I think this will be a wonderful film for the true believer in the organized Christian faith, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking and separation of church and state and good science fiction, it is a terrible joke! There are some well-known actors who were either in desperate need of work or who needed to share their personal beliefs with the rest of the pagans. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie the same way I enjoyed "Reefer Madness". This film tried to teach drug education through intimidation tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery to good people who do not share their interpretation of our world. <br /> <br /> It made me laugh and at the same time scared me to realize how many people really believed that our society should go back to the early days of the nineteenth century!
