Never waste your time on this tinker. Movie. A remake does not need to be re-listed. Everyone who came out of the theater had the same comments. The worst film I have ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage was walking in the hills, swirling in mysterious waters and rolling over the hills while he was being attacked by bees, but still a fully pressed suit and a crisp white shirt to the very last scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film was great with Elaine Bernstein and Cage, the acting was unbelievable like the film itself. It's amazing how good actors can do these bad films. Do not get a copy of the script first. If you're still interested in watching the movie at least wait for it to appear on the DVD.
