This film was bragging from nicknames to credits, it was boring to the point of boredom and wooden representation and composite! It is recognized that this was the film director Richard Jobson, who directs for the first time, but who lit up on the ground a weak text such a scenario? It looks like other funds down the Government drain project (the Scottish screen is a surprise, surprise). I almost slept three times, and unfortunately my assessment would be more restrictive than this. Please, please Mr. Jobson what you're doing before directing these painkillers to a movie, go back!
