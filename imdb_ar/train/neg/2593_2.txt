American Pie: Beta House is in a state of forgetfulness between species. On the one hand, it's a comedy without a plot and a few really smart jokes. On the other hand, it is a pornographic matter so small that it can not play any scenes. Essentially, Beta House is a collection of sexual scenes - some of them offensive, others merely emotional attempts at humor - with subtle plot points raised in an attempt at cohesion. The characters are hardly two-dimensional, most of the development depends on the knowledge of Naked Mile, and scenes of "important" plots are so far apart that you wonder why the book feels the need for a story. > In all fairness, I did not go to this movie without expectation. I loved the original three American Pie movies, and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were a good rental. I thought the Naked Mile was good enough to be released in the theaters, so when I saw that some of the characters were coming back to Beta House, I was excited to see this batch. I realized that there would be many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. I was fine with her, because in the past these scenes were supported by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, it seems as if the writers forgot why the formula was successful in other AP movies. They spent so much energy in nudity that they forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is disappointing and not worth even renting a single dollar. Lame jokes, the story does not exist, and the pornography aspect is very weak if that's all you really care about seeing.
