In the 1970s, WPIX ran "Superman Adventures" every afternoon for a few days. From time to time, we will get treatment when they stay next to the shows "Superman and the Mole Men". I've always been looking forward to those days. When I saw her recently, I was surprised at the extent of her harm. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of special effects or not. It is true that the costume of George Reeves Superman was so bad, and the edges of the foam pad were used to make it look clearer. True, mole men's costumes were worse. What was supposed to be a furry cover would not have fooled a 10-year-old boy, because the zippers, side shoulders, and poorly designed badly woven fabric in loose costumes were all painfully clear. But these were shortcomings that could be overlooked. <br /> <br /> No, what make it bad are the fake painting devices. Again and again, Superman failed to do anything to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Lynx mob looking for creatures? Instead of assembling hysterical crowds or searching for creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lewis and the PR man. Creatures surrounded? Again, he stands around watching and talking but does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, mayor of the city, shoot him? Trying to kill anyone reasonable, but Superman releases the man over and over again to cause more problems. Superman had few opportunities to solve the problem in its infancy, but no one had used it before. <br /> <br /> However, George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, and they immediately seemed comfortable in the roles. If they just got better text to work with them.
