Yes, this one of those movies, very terrible, very weak, too vulgar, so you will not be able to stop laughing. I saw a comedy, a good comedy, and I laughed less than my wife and laughed at this film. Other comments give a good enough idea. The characters are so unpleasant that you rejoice with the mice, and the effects are very bad. You wonder about the professional class at the primary school that was responsible, and acting - acting - talking about a tired dialogue and an awkward pause. <br /> But mice, yes, the big rat. Why we could not see the mice until the end surprised me. The "big" is often not shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects affect a lot of money. However, I suspect that in this case the big mice were hidden to the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that their best was a man running in clothes like a wooden engraving with dentistry in the Third World. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After finding that mice could not tolerate high noise (migraine from bad behavior?), The main dude raises the fire alarm to send mice to madness. If you want to see a pair of waltz rats while blood spills out of their heads like a heater, this film is right for you. Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not more than 99 Â¢, okay?
