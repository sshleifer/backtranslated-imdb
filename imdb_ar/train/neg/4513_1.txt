Although the book was not entirely accurate to the real situation he described, it still carries a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved in making this film ever had Japan because it did not feel Japanese at its simplest. Almost everything about this subject was terrible. I will admit that the actors were generally good but could not afford to save them. Before the film began, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on Friday night shortly after the opening of the film in Japan. 30 minutes in amazement they stayed. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize them. The entire film was permeating my ears and laughing at the disbelief of my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw coming out of that cinema seemed to be confused and disappointed on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the makers of this film, you owe me two hours.
