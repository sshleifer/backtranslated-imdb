To compare this narrowness with an old budget porn flick, it will be an insult to the old pornographic low budget flick. Animal scenes have no meaning and do not represent this man and his crimes even in the broad sense of experience. The summary on the back of the DVD can say "partially re-listing the killer terror era BTK Killer." This is not a novel. The re-telling process tells you what happened, how or why. None of these things is true. I'm an enthusiastic student of serial killers and I've seen some crazy movies about them and frankly, this is not one of them. This is not even about BTK killer. Save yourself some time and some dollars and instead rent Dahmer. That serial killer movie is accurate and correct. However, if you just want to watch this movie yourself, check it out for free in your local library and even then, you'll still feel cheated.
