I rarely write a negative review of this site, but I felt this time to comply with it. Night Nightener is without doubt one of the most wonderful films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing going on in this film at all - I did not care about any of the characters, I did not buy the entire mystery scheme, did not care how it ended ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no suspense, no suspense, nothing. Highlights (no spoilers - nothing spoiled): a man climbs out of a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car running over a rough floor and a truck issuing its voice. I really enjoyed "One Hour of Photos" and hoped for a similar foreign role from Williams, but unfortunately disappointed our hopes. The most disappointing thing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I had to feel empathy with the characters, but it did not work with me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I gave it 1/10 but this result is reserved for reissuing the producers
