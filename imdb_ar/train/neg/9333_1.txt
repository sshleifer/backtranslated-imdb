terrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this film contains the IQ of a stupid monkey. What is the disaster? I could not believe how bad this film was. The dialogs are very strange and irrelevant, sometimes the camera works only horrifying, sometimes music like the soundtrack to Lawrence of Arabia, I watched this movie just to see how far it could get. Some "actors" from side-kick are a complete disaster. Which can hang down on my body falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows he might be in a financial predicament for participating in such a failed film. . . . . This film was to be presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them a lesson on how not to produce a film
