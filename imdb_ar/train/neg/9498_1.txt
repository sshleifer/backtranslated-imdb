When I look for new cars, I expect no boats to appear. When I drink a coke fountain, I must expect that the drink contains coke. When I watch a film that decorates itself as an excellent scientist, I expect it to be somehow related to that person or his work. People could have discussed grandmothers' notes. The material that is covered is only relevant in terms of it's mysterious tirade science. I was missing the first time I tried to watch them, and the second time I stopped watching them. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. Best viewed on the latest movies. But this does not amount to saving anything worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
