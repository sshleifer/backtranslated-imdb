Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-wrote the script from the story of Roth.this zombie, owes much to George Romero and his previous "dead films", and to remember the original Texas Deadly Massacre "Evil Dead" Sam Ramie. There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. Representation revolves around this kind, it is the failure of the story. We have seen this film before and said that after being a commercial success, if not a technical success of this film, Roth decided to be a way out and went out with a terrible awful, mean soul, meaningless (although more ambitious) Hostel crap fest Hostel.Roth must resign while in the back. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, but compared to Hostel, it's a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychologist) persuades this guy that filmmaking is the wrong job choice. Cabin fever, 3/10 is weak for not being a smal dad as a hostel.
