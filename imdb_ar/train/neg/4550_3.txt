Dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Make no mistake here, I'm not one of those influential fanatics, but I was really thinking that the overlay was a practice of the long past, especially the sixties. So I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took forever to cut it and release it. But as far as I know, they did not have mobile phones in the 1960s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is basically a good story with a really good message. Representation is secondary, secondary effects, I do not even mind some small contradictions. However, in films such as this bad, incredible act, etc., you can add a bad movie to the worst - and this is what happened to me with Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was really good, and although I am not in all those spiritual things, I can somehow see that it can be confronted in a credible way - the film failed to do so. <br /> <br /> There may be one reason to watch this one though. If you really like cheese films, they will be the right movies for you. If the IMDb stars are cheery instead of quality, I should rate this movie for ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are three stars to the fact that there are worse movies, such as "critical mass" (look for comments on this one - hilarious). Celestine's prophecy is at least amusing to a certain degree.
