Here we have a film that fails in every possible way to fail the film. Horrible scenario, bad representation, amateur directing, special specials for laughter ... It's just a very bad movie. Not to mention the fact that when you reach the end, you will realize that the whole thing will make no sense. After spending the entire film wondering what is going on in the world here when things are finally explained, realize that the story has been built on a very impossible basis. In one of the series "The Punk" which explains the entire film, "We were told that our wicked did something that could not be done simply, and that makes no sense at all ... Oh, and then we see that there seems to be some kind of lean beast. Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend that this movie never happened.If you have an unthinkable reason to ever sit down and watch this movie, I might instead suggest spending that time hitting your head against the wall for 104 minutes. More enjoyable than sitting in this trash.
