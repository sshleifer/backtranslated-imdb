Hearing this praise about this play, I decided to watch it when it stumbled across the cable. I do not see how this "raises" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject. I think if you're interested in stories about women's special parts and how they affect their lives, that's right for you. Otherwise, it's rather boring and boring. If you find something, I found it a bit humiliating. <br /> <br /> I inquired with a friend of hers I saw this too and thought it was horrible as well. So, not just a "do not get it" man.
