A short and sensational new edition of the classic David Lean film in 1945, based on Noel Coward's "Still Life" play. A doctor removes a lump of gravel from the eye of a woman at a railway station, in a miserable relationship, happily married to a social worker of Italian origin. They meet by chance on another occasion and form an immediate attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday. The couple are in love, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to secession. Coward's original acting single was about two ordinary people who fell in love. Sophia Laurin and Richard Burton, two great two-star and epic Hollywood veterans, are not an idea of ​​"ordinary people". Lauren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looks like a million dollars, working as a part-time volunteer social worker in the Citizen Consulting Bureau is not just a fact. Burton, who is looking for a dyed haircut, dyed a lot of make-up and wearing podium shoes, does not come across as an ordinary general practitioner. However, you can not blame them for their marital relationship. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings reviewing toxic views and treats her husband with complete contempt. Lauren's husband, Jack Headley, runs around the house all day and is certainly bored: the most exciting thing he has ever done is an affair six years ago. Their last scene together will lead to nausea, ("I've come a long way", etc.). This great British recruit, John Lomisurier, has three minutes as a friend of Burton, and he seems to have a slight lack of speech, barely speaking of his lines. It is a sad and forgotten performance in a terrible and dismal re-design of a classic film. Avoid at all costs.
