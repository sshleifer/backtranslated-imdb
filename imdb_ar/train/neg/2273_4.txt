This was not the major disaster I was expecting, but this was as positive as possible in my descriptive film. I'm not sure what was supposed to be funny about this film, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it funny to see temples that live their stupid lives or laugh at themselves on television, but again, I'm not a fan of the lively talk show Jerry Springer. I did not feel too bored to see this, but I certainly did not enjoy it at all. If you're in a mood to see a bad movie, but a very painless movie, that's a good choice.
