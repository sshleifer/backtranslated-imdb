Where to start ... Oh, send a message to the bad guys: When you first find the person you're tracking (for murder) who has witnessed a crime, do not spend time talking to her so there's another chance to escape. Message to the victim: When the thugs are talking to each other and arguing, take this opportunity to "Run Away", do not sit there and watch them make a sound they hear. Message to the manager: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute start in a car or on foot, you will not be able to put the bad guys on your heels or bumper right away! Time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that women do not have to kill (4) men brutally in order to enable themselves to leave an abusive relationship at home.
