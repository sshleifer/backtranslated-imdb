Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this terrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes, but I thought I would give him a chance because he was getting better. Or at least you have some characteristics, just as I realized that at least it would be a wonderful film, or I really like intelligence, or was filmed well or something ... Needless to say, it was not, I lost about an hour and a half of my life. I do not even understand why it's so terrible because it's a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down something spoilers and pay more attention to make sure that people who rate movies are not paid and comment to write good reviews or Participate somehow in the film or anything else like that. I thought it would be funny after this terrible film that a bad shovel would come to classify the rating and I was very shocked to see fairly high ratings ... All ratings should contain about 7-10 stars around some quite different film ... I'm still A great admirer of IMDb, but seriously rethinking this classification process because this movie should not be higher than maaaybbbeee like 3.
