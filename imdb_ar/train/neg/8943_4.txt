John Wayne and Albert Decker vie for oil rights in Indian territory and draw Martha Scott's attention in Republic Pictures, which was filmed in Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> Western is somewhat interesting because of its characters and it is a more modern place, where Wayne & Dekker plays old and new factions in the West. It is based on a story written by Thompson Portis, who co-wrote the script with Eleanor Griffin and Ethyl Hill. Albert Rogel directs the way to suit his career. A beautiful worldly story is actually saved by the last third, where fortunately the action rises and we act on something like a pulse. The lukewarm approach to the romantic bands is not entirely correct, and Rogel has lost a wonderful fight between the two rivals because he can not hide the imaginary men doing the work. But hey, men stunt deserve the moment of glory always. The strong support from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has a lot of charisma on the screen, especially when throwing a gun. But despite its better than usual budget for the Republic, it remains a movie that interests Wayne fans in the 1940s. 10/04
