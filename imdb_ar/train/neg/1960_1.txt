I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's awesome. Example: My mother and daughter arrive at bed and breakfast, my mother stops gas, crazy gas station crazy eccentric from her husband who is trying to jogging on bed and breakfast raped. She escapes, heads to B & B, and instead of going ballistic and wanting to call the police, the story continues only with lukewarm behavior in both parts. wow. <br /> <br /> There is a deficit in the logic of other actions. Acting also acts lukewarm, and neighbors' neighbor's alarm is sent in angry moments by bad behavior. <br /> <br /> The moments of intense nausea / death are intertwined with the lukewarm scenes of interacting with the time stuffing between characters. <br /> <br /> Focus will be less on gore, more emphasis on mood and story was appreciated.
