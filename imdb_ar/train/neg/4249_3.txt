I did not know that this movie existed until shortly after seeing the Blade: Trinity, I was wandering around the Trinity board when I saw some users recall how Wes Craven series was much better then "Crap" and that's Blade, so I did my quick search: The results on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search, I discovered that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that in Wes Craven Dracula's paintings there was a real strong follow-up for this film which represents a great contrast with the grades that I saw her. <br /> <br /> Now, let's take a quick personal summary here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not admiring it at all, then watching dozens of Dracula: Ascension lessened my expectations more, but then again, I'm the kind who really needs to watch the movie myself (no film) so I can form my opinion The private. <br /> <br /> There are some things I've known when I started watching this movie that the budget is low, and that's why I'm going to have to ignore a lot of v / fx and her character will be compensated by story and acting, and I was also impressed by some of the actors In this film (Jason London, Roy Cheddar and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Hey Geez ?? This movie was cheesy! But entertainment can be fun at least, I found it very laughable, the bad audio synchronization of the replay of the dialogue in the scenes of FEW, and the stupidity of characters in this film. Sure, they knew all about vampires and some basic things, even if he had a book about him, but did he stop them from wanting to get "hit" on purpose? No, this is the worst then clicking on the spots where the girl must get out of the bathroom and check the noise you hear without anything but a towel. <br /> <br />, because I'm not sure how Dracula put on his body, especially as he is very angry and angry and I appreciate that I was in this position, and I do not want to be the person I wear. <br /> <br /> So the movie ends like any medium movie from a trilogy? No, instead is "Cliff Hangar" where I can now wait for the third installment "Legacy". Hey entertainment value for Cheesy movies.
