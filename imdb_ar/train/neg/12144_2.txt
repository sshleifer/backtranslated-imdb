Although there is nothing comparable to Vampires Vs. Zombie ... In any area of ​​filmmaking, I will try to judge this film. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were impressive. When there was an explosion on television, I thought my house would explode and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells were falling on the floor next to me. Simply put, my friends were astounded. <br /> <br /> But the scene that shows the Black Jack sound you like is the worst monologue that I heard I almost killed myself, but do not worry because it caught fire. The film can convey its awful work on "I Must Be High". Seriously, he must have watched himself ranting mercilessly about the seemingly incoherent mismatched ideas at all, adding only that he must be "high" to justify his terrible actions. Well, if you can say that to excuse the terrible representation, if you talk to writers, directors, executive producers and sponsors, you might get the same response ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked and I did not put a machine gun in my mouth and ended my life after this terrible excuse was used for the film. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you must kill <br /> <br /> you really, <br /> <br /> year
