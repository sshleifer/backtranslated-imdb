If you are trying to build tension in a movie, it is always best not to build it beyond the point of total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Butcher Brothers has not yet grasped this. <br /> <br /> This film is absorbed, unlike most of its characters who (if they do not succeed, they vampires in the first few minutes and then shame on you) prefer to increase the show "No one knows where I am I'm the types of fans and homosexuality Which looms comfortably and has a fast-food hamburger behind their insulated door. <br /> <br /> The smallest thing in the originality of this plot is how the vampires became vampires in the first place, but what remains of it is ridiculous and dirty. <br /> <br /> They were forced to raise the sticks (as opposed to the dangers) on a regular basis because of their tendency to fill their graves with non-blood bodies, If they feed their victims, they can manage their own blood farm and will reduce mortality, allowing them to settle down and be confused. <br /> <br /> Why did producers feel it was necessary to present incest and his older brother gay gay I'm not sure, I've added zero to the scheme, which is unfortunate because there is not much conspiracy to start and it has absolutely no shock value. <br /> <br /> No one has been told why the parents died, unless Of course this was explained during one of the frequent tea breaks. It is clear that the family social worker must be notified for one reason or another but once again, the viewer has to write his own reasons. <br /> <br /> The only round character is the younger brother who appeared like Pugsley from the Adams family. In fact, it was very round, where a child accidentally wandered from the "Weight Watchers" category to a very bad horror film. Oh heaven, he had. Do not mind my dear, take other donuts with a delicious blood center.
