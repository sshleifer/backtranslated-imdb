I was delighted to watch this movie for free while working in the hotel industry, and this film recently came to our film library. Nothing against low-budget films, but this film has a terrible representation and direction. How can you make a movie like this ever. The manager must be blacklisted, and for all poor actors, it is certainly not a jumping board in a career. Please make sure you will not see this movie, the representation is lame, the camera is a terrible guide. There are only a few films that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money from this film must give him charity work, so he is at least working for good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I was watching it until the last 10 (or at least once again).
