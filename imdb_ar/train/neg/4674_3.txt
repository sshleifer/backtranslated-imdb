I do not know who is to blame, Ms. Lee or her manager, but her performance Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin on the other hand does an excellent job - despite all the odds as far as I'm concerned. His personality is quite charming and very charming. But certainly does not appear greedy enough, to bear the personal absurdity of me. Chaplin seems confused by what can not be understood as being ashamed of him and his lack of grace, but his instability in the bones. There must be an element of credibility to his advantage, but as I played, it is incomprehensible. Offers do not vibrate. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, are wonderful despite any effort to frustrate them. Cast support is also a pleasure to watch. Unfortunately, the threads do not work together because the production is beautiful to look at.
