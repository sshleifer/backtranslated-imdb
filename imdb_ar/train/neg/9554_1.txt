This is the worst, I mean the worst movie based on computers I've ever seen. The whole plot is completely unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The person in this movie can talk to the computer as a real person. Now you might think that this should be some high-tech computers brilliant, well, it is, but it also does with other weak and weak computers that do not even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> The main idea is how to overload the "super" computer by connecting to it via a computer game on the network. My mobile phone will turn off the lighting to conserve energy, but it seems that this genius computer can not determine the use of its resources to deal with national security threats or download computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also some bad things about things, but I do not have time for that. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone can record a stupid movie because that's it
