There is no one sympathetic character in this entire film. Is he the lawyer Kenneth Branagh is supposed to be ready for? Well, let's see - we learn that he is a lethal defense lawyer who keeps the criminals away from technical matters. Treat coworkers like cattle, make them implicated in their personal crisis (in the process of killing someone), endanger the safety of their children, threaten the friend of their new ex-wife, and try to arm the police school principals - all for what? Because he was thinking of his little head! I was actually pressuring the father and his gang to overcome the lawyer's padding and dumping him in the swamp ... it could have led to a very satisfactory end.
