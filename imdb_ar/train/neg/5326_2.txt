"Smithereens" is a kind of worthless flick that comes out only between cable channels that occupy space like the cheese dime novel in the public library. The futile film of the humble director, Sideliman, is fraught with failure to act, bad sound, poor camera work, and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the best movies never reach the market, why do unwanted clicks like this film and it never seems that one of the great mysteries of life ever disappears. (Dr-)
