This comedic service, which was chosen by Peter Marshall (brother of Joan Drew and later host of the Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Nunan because the new "Lewis and Martin" are just shy of the atrocities: a few random gags are inserted into the sight, everyone speaks quickly and nothing works Properly - there is one scene where Noonan hurls hand grenades at angry officers and politicians; separated them by about five feet, Nunan throw them between them, and the overall reaction is that everyone is fluttering. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the calamity felt by Julie Newmar only, there are few moments of brightness: Marshall and Nunan engage in intermittent periods of double talk and controversy, and their timing is near perfect - obviously they were my beloved comedy couples . <br /> <br /> This is not enough to save Turkey, unfortunately.
