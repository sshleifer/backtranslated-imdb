The first cruel, original intentions, is my favorite film of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth can make a very bad sequel. Sarah Michelle Gillard was perfect in the first film. In this, Amy Adams absorbs. It's awful. Can not they find a chick like Michelle Gillard? At least the same hair color! I mean come. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is very terrible compared to Ryan Phillip. Sebastian in the first film is a deceptive, deceptive, much more evil than Sebastian in the lead. And what's up with the storyline. It goes without saying ... <br /> <br /> 1. Sebastian has a bad delegate at his first school, so the film says, although he does not mention anything about him and about his dating life, and how he was with girls 2- Sebastian He moves to New York, and suddenly decides he will change himself. "I'm in love with Daniel" (may I remind you that originally, Sarah Michelle Geller says "I broke up with the first person I loved because I told him, how could he be in love with Prequel?). Beautiful and charming, and all a "good person," because he refuses to have sex with the chick his father used to do. <br /> <br /> 3. He plays the entire 180, ends up in a trilogy at the end of the film, and then seduces Cherry. > <br /> I mean, terrible, I loved the first so much, so I have not seen the third so far.I hope God is better than this package.
