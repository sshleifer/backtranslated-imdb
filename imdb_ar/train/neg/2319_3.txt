Lots of silly plot holes in the movie. First, we see him watching his main practice of Kung Fu, and die in the midst of his practice. it's good for me. Then at the end of the film, we see him using kung fu, which he learned only by watching his master when he was still a child. Is this possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is only for Jay Chu fans, and the film lacks depth in terms of personal development, cinematography, and conspiracy detection. <br /> <br /> Has anyone noticed that the basketball team leader (forgot his name) and the idol of Li Xiaotu are so similar that you think they are the same person? Long hair, sun boy look, tall and strong. The two looked as though they had come out of a huge production plant designed to produce products that made teenage girls scream in orgasm. This is not for those two actors anything that has the value to contribute to the film as a whole to the film industry at all. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The scene of four of Jay Chu's professors has deteriorated to help him in the basketball court, turning into a useless conspiracy when they began beating their opponents in the Royal Rumble style. Worst of all, when the four masters won the battle, the crowd began to cheer, and the game continued. Was it really WTF? Moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the game, all thanks to the excellent skills of Kung Fu. How to acquire kung fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him acquiring skills by simply observing his master. <br /> <br /> Then his long-lost father goes out of woodwork to see Jay Cho as his long-lost son who looked like a quick boy in directing the director out of the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is Jay Choo's flick (instead of the usual "flick"). Just watch it if Jay Cho is your fan. If you are one of those who match their tastes in movies with those in the top 250 best IMDb movies of all time, this movie is not for you.
