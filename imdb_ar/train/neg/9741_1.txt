(The spoilers) The only truly unforgettable part of this boring and unflattering British kitchen is the henna rinsing in Steiner, one of the worst dyes ever. So, the brilliant caterpillar eyebrows on the old dude who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an impressive job making the film boring and miserable. I especially like when Mike Crowe is killed by "The Touch of Death" and when he refreshes the stage, Mike cries, "Hey guys, I'm dead, and I've seen the eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this is the movie ..." We return from the afterlife to watch the rest of the fallen man. The movie can make a fortune sold as a sleep assistant. Some villains in the film were evil: the police inspector - "electrocution!" Crow - "Shock, right?" Police Inspector - "That's Fabulous, All Right" Tom Cervo - "Too Low, Down the Earth!" Inspector of Police - "Can I get?" Tom Cervo - "You're dead, but take yourself out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snooze.
