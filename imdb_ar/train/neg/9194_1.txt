Well, first of all, I'm a huge zombie movie enthusiast. I loved all Romeo's clicks and enjoyed completely remaking the dawn of the dead. So when I heard every critic criticizing this film, I was still optimistic. I mean, the critics hated the Resident Evil movie, and although it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun coma with a decent half plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half assed plot, and video game scenes included in the film. Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea. The only thing in this film (use the term loosely) that I enjoyed is Jurgen Prochnow as commander of Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws authenticity out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows that in a terrifying film, he may benefit from it. Everyone acts as if they are doing Shakespeare. And very bad has been added. Basically, the only reason anyone makes such a brutal look is if you). Are you stupid in a huge zombie and you should see every flick in the zombie made or b). Such as playing MST3K, home game. Watch it with friends and be prepared for large numbers of unintended laughter. <br /> <br />
