I never thought I saw a film worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but that's very close. As frequently repeated throughout the comments, was predictable. Five minutes after the movie you know, there will be a problem with the result of the change. This film painfully points to everything from "Something About Mary" to "Pink Panther Revenge". Author Greg Glena (learn about parents) needs some new material. <br /> <br /> The only development is the messy police officer / officer involved in internal affairs, but even this opportunity is lost. Lots of Seattle shots space needle shots needed to hide the Canadian shooting language is clear. Some of the worst driving scenes in cars without any effort to virtually hide the fact that the car is pulled across the city on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or place the brakes one by one. Salma Blair is inactive and short hair cut is a crime. $ 3 million to Jason Lee, why? I think it beats skiing! <br /> <br /> So, here's who should watch this movie: The fans of Bee Gees who want to hear actors singing "Islands in the Stream" badly; people who can not get enough of Julia Steeles. 10/01
