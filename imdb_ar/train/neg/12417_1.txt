Can not prepare any film starting with skin shaking by a female calf. As for the stereotypes of the kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it was not. Well, every kibbutz had only a small piece of the film (such as young people attacking the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbutz as full of all those traits - we should say - naughty. Each kibbutz has its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz has all of them. Israel's views were wonderful. I still remember my youth in this Garden of Eden which is called Emek (Valley). Yes, the acting was also good, so you see that it was not all black - just a wrong portrayal - maybe also on purpose.
