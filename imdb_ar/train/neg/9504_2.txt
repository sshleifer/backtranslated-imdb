The only reason I saw this film is that I had recently read the story of Robert Hoff for less than perfect, but it is interesting and imaginative about the life of the great cat trainer Maple Starck. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in light less than temptation. <br /> <br /> I did not realize until after checking the film later on IMDb that it was originally serial. Who edited the original runtime of 233 minutes down to the mini-DVD version available on DVD, did a good job. The short version works just like any B movie of that period despite "duh-what?" Moments. For example, is it really expected to believe our hero, who dug a deep tiger trap twenty feet long in the morning without causing panic? If we look at the titles of the chapters, I see that the number five is entitled "Gorilla War" and the eleventh is called the "gorilla". There was no gorilla at all in the film. I think this is where some cuts have been made. <br /> <br /> Interesting history.
