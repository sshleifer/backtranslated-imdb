Although Bette Davis did a great job like Mildred, I felt that the film was not the best I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I felt there was something missing in it. <br /> <br /> The House of Davis did a great job, making me hate and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard did a very good job like beloved Philip Curry, and I did it throughout the film because he loved this terrible lady. It is sad when one finds himself in love with bad seeds. Especially if someone like Philp Carey, a sensitive person, though pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, acting was what happened and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I'm not alone. Although others may find this movie good, I only find it well. I would recommend this movie to those who love bad seed so they can see what might happen to them if they find themselves in love with this terrible person.
