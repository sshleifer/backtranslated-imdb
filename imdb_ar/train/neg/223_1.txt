Not a "movie woman" but a movie of the gang. One of the worst films made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy Mackay simply does not know the woman. Bad taste tops, American humor style, crude story, meaningless, unfounded story, amazing characters came vulgar fantasies to life on screen. Insult and certainly not funny. I wonder how three good actresses have accepted to participate.
