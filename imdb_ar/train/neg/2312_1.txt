This is one of those films I wish I would stay in. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely boring frankly. What the story there is very flimsy and you have to guess. The film blends with false camera techniques that seem bent on causing migraines and making it look like a film. Did you say it was boring already? If all the characters died suddenly at the end of the film, I would not have less sponsorship because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about it. This is the first time I have thought of getting out of the cinema during a theater show, but I thought it should have improved. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The type of film that can be threatened by the rioters.
