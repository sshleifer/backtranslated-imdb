"Spielberg likes the smell of emotion in the morning, but the feelings at the expense of the truth narrative? No one should love it." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" takes place in Deep South during the early 20th century and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-born sisters. The film begins with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an ideal haven instantly crashed by the father's wife. This motif? The innocence is cut off from men ?? Permeates the entire film. <br /> <br /> Then the film begins in a series of short sequences. Sealy was bitten twice by her mother's husband, giving birth in a dirty barn. Her newly born baby was taken away and forced to marry a local widow, Albert Johnson, a violent and often raping rapist who forced her to cook, clean and care for his children. <br /> <br /> All these horrific scenes are given a short screen time, instead surrounded by moments of filming dust, a pompous symphony, a contrasting comedy, and an overactive camera. The cumulative effect is like a Disney cartoon and a rape film, a controversial aesthetic that caused Stanley Kubrick to notice that "purple" made him feel so nauseous that he had to stop it after ten minutes. Ten minutes? It lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> It is often said that the film deals with "racism", "sexual discrimination" and "black culture", but this is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the film is based, claims to be bisexual but in fact lesbian. Her book is a magical fiction, a story about female liberation and self-discovery, which depicts men as violent savages discouraging women. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is for women to bond together in a kind of ideal utopia and celebrate the black brothers and the independence of the female. <br /> <br /> Still, Spielberg recreates Walker's story through a lens of reassuring American mythology. It is a film in which the power of Christian redemption overcomes the natural cruelty of men. A film in which Albert finds himself in ridiculous positions, moments of comedy have been misplaced to make him look like a fool. A film in which all the characters of the racial miners are drawn, the cast consists of failed men (always smiling with evil smiles and serrated smiles), typical fat mammals, jazz bands and gospel legends. <br /> <br /> This is the film in which blacks are naturally childish and easily accept their social conditions. A film in which blacks are over-sexed, and physical sensations capture violent emotions. A film in which poverty and class issues are completely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are quite incompetent. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as it is derived from Gone with the Wind, MGM Muscals, South Song, Warner Comics, Halleluha! Disney movies were banned. In other words, it is the south as seen by a child who grew up on 1950s television. All this is a cartoonist, very racist in the way that these people are reduced to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes, which made black novelist Ishmael Reid similar to a Nazi plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a typical Spielberg fashion, the film ends with family links. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by reconciling each character in the story with their relatives. <br /> <br /> Behind Walker's hate speech to black men and the alien Spielberg cartoons of black life, we have shown nothing black society. We have only the most obscure ideas about how any of these characters earn a living and not insight into how they interact with others in their community. Instead, the Spielberg camera jumps and fights hard for our attention (one of the Celie cuisine seems to belong to "Home Alone"), every ending, the director never comes out to notice something or let a little life simply pass by. This is accompanied by Quincy Jones's "silly" white music, and you have one of the weirdest films in the history of cinema: an angry feminist channel portrayed by a white Jew in Disney and Griffith style, recorded by a black man trying to imitate John Williams. <br /> <br /> The problem is also the lack of white characters. Consider this: The men in this film are not portrayed as rude to each other, and do not control women because they are brutally abused by a racist society that reduces their masculinity. No, they are cruel by nature. And women, whether calmly like Sealy or rebellious and as tough as her sister, persevere and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. The best film will not only focus on the oppression of women because it happens among the oppressed, but it will also show that societal abuse leads to marital abuse. Black women are forced to perform the same tasks as their male counterparts (with their traditional female roles continuing) The African American family is largely due to economic factors, women who are unable to support themselves and their children on their own. <br /> <br /> So, there is a hidden ideology in the works here. In the late part of the film one character tells another that because he did not respect his wife, she ended up being beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to regain their dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them. I respect each other in the minority community and will not interfere with the prevailing white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - The failure to confront sex, lesbianism, inappropriate music numbers, an endless sequence of exotic visual pizzas, incompatible comic acts, painful music signals and excessive passion all contribute to the "purple" Worthless.
