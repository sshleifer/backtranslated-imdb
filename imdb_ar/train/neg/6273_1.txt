This movie was so cute to the end. The end was just a despicable attempt to redeem men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to logic and logic and used her negative / aggressive nature to control her will and impose on the man who finally gave his power and control the relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she was sitting behind the steering wheel in the car because she was finally launched after having to beg her and contact her to retrieve him. This film is a triumph for all women who believe that they should be responsible for all men and control their relationships with them. It was a filthy film for this reason.
