Let's just say simple words so filmmakers can get a chance to understand: This is a very stupid movie that contains stupid text, lame animations, and a story that looks as original as paper screws. Do not bother - unless you need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or very slow children. They may laugh, especially if they are outside their sink. There is a special kind of insult in a ridiculous film - the filmmakers do not seem to think only that stupid children are mindless and who can enjoy watching the clamp that cost almost zero effort, but they do not even bother to break the sweat of introducing a gap here and there that you may find Adult entertaining. This film, frankly, put me in place. Shame on you to bend it so low.
