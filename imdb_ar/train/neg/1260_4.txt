Yes, Chanke, this is the pseudonym of Donna Reds who played Tom Drake's romantic! So let's get this clear immediately. From her first role in the game GET-AWAY (1941), her last role, DALLAS (1984-1985), Ms. Reid could never be described as Chanki. This actress is not attractive and gentle. Who roles in M.G.M. Rarely live up to her talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reid is powered by a group of actors who are competent characters, who unfortunately must stumble through this supposed "ball screw" comedy. Obviously M.G.M. It was far from the depth of making this kind of film. The type was best produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even Universal. This film can not save the "touch" of Ernest Lubitch or the intelligence of Preston Sturgis. A fairly traditional romantic comedy that contains all the signs of pre-war effort (World War II). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg was alive, the screenplay would either have been rewritten or not seen by daylight. They fit into the "safe area" of Louis B. Meyer's family entertainment is no challenge. Form can not face the post-war challenges of "DeHavilland decision", the loss of theater series, television, will contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reid, her best days are before she leaves here forever (1953) and winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
