Frankly, who gave the name of God this movie rated 8.1? I think the people who actually made or took the lead in the film are the ones who voted. Otherwise suck this movie! This film is nothing more than an amateur film, or perhaps a student. I'm a fanatic of the film, I've seen terrible movies, but there was nothing to get back here. The story and acting were the worst I've ever seen. Props, including the use of airsoft guns game with terrible special effects, where equally bad as everything else. I'm all for bad language in movies, but F-Bomb has been dropped for every third word and I think we may have a winner in using more than a F-Bomb game in any film at all. It seems that the film was filmed using cheap video cameras and not real movies. I expect this to be an amateur film award that is only shown on public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is a precious time that will not return. Unfortunately for me, this time is lost, but not too late. If you decide to rent this movie, think about this warning.
