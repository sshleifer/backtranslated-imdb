Please make me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst film I have ever seen. I consider the film an insult to my mind as well as my ass that suffered during my sitting and watching this film. I have not yet been able to know the damage my optical has caused and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of garbage !! And do not make me start acting ... someone please help me in forgetting !! "The strange science" - Count !! Everything has been tolerated ... <br /> <br /> I'm proud to give this first 1 movie here at IMDb ... I have voted for hundreds of movies ... many of them are c ** p but this is very bad I can not So believe it. Has someone reached the idea and thought it deserves to become a film? Someone already read the script and decided to produce the film? Someone read the script and tested it? Someone watched the movie and decided * No * Put it on a shelf to collect dust forever? * These * are the questions I want to answer. The philosophical question about that tree is not in the forest as well, you know ...
