I know actors and actresses prefer to experiment with different types of films - hey, nobody wants to get a typecast - but Danny Glover and Brenda Fricker (Happy Birthday and Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better. The film "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie where everything seems lost until someone comes up with something magical and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The film is just a modest escape (examples of a great escape are various science fiction films from the 1950s). If these films contain a political idea - or at least offered us a new look at life - they will be fine; this one is just useless. Much closer to the demonic than the angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrian Brody and Matthew McConaughey, I suspect they do not want to emphasize this in their autobiography.
