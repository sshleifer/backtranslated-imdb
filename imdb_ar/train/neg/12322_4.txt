As it seems to be the general essence of these comments, the film contains some amazing animations (seen on Blu-ray Disc) but does not meet any real depth. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are all pretty boring. I got a hint of a kind of attitude to LaBota between Agito, Tula and Shonak's main opponent. However, perhaps my thinking was wandering around and this was a wishful thinking (Labota is my favorite anime, the original Angelic describes it). The characters are not really loved As we mentioned in another publication, they fall in love with extraordinary speed, leaving the poor old Manka feeling jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems oblivious to this). Yet they seem to tolerate Toola in the end without any explanation for changing the heart other than they make the end a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of interpretation. Like who are the priests really? Are they people? And who are the strange women / girls who seem to kneel and run the forest? There is nothing to explain why they exist and how they can give regular human forces. Plants coming from the moon still do not fill the blanks around this. Looks like the strange version of The Day of the Trifids. <br /> <br /> Who links to Toola? Why do you care about this if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie but I could not find a piece of land close to a movie like Ghost in the Shell or any real character like Miyazaki. I do not feel sorry to see him but I wish I did not buy it. My advice? Try if you have a few hours to spare, but borrow, or buy at a cheap price! Maybe if your new movies are animated and you do not have much to enjoy, you'll enjoy them. It's definitely visually pleasing.
