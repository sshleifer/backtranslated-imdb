It is quite a shock to me why Godard is taken seriously - and One Plus One is a wonderful example of his incompetence as a director and a "cultured" argumentator. It is hard to be credited that Godard believed in all that was Marxist and Maoist Kant. Anyone with half a brain can succeed in bankrupting that "creed" and the number of people who have been destroyed and are still being destroyed even while Godard makes his films that support them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: will you have a dull voice reading the political feelings boring to your audience, and then, when you can not think of anything else, connect another voice to the first voice over, which has lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case ? Fantastic, Jean-Luc! For Godard's insistence on producing a movie with the Rolling Stones: Of course he did, did not he? It was the only guarantee to show such reckless garbage in the first place: the genius of the stones excels at a ruthless political idiot shaking a camera. The library library scene was not worth the worst of the marginal theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence even young children who used to play it - as can be seen easily. To stop by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this non-artistic nonsense was a satire in the mainstream film industry is nothing more than a safe way out for those who clearly see Godard's poverty in the arrogant thought and disdain of his audience. Truffaut, from Goodard's great friend for one time, with Nuit Americain, the best film about filmmaking ever, has made Godard the worst with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not choose the path of the Stones to sympathize with Satan. I happened to have a track on which they were working when the "movie" began shooting at the Barnes Olympic Studios.
