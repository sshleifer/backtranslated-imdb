In what seems like the longest one hour I have had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino offers a careful performance to make sure. It does not have the usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was just really pathetic. A lamentable person who stumbles in forgetting the dates where we realize that social life in Hollywood has exhausted his energy in life. But in this film, we needed someone you liked. For some reason, every character in the photo said "I do not know why I love you, Eli" to the Al Pacino singer and I could not even get close to admiring him. <br /> <br /> All other actors have played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn have not done anything to change their corporate personalities developed on television or in previous movies. Kim Basinger was not long enough to make a show of any kind. <br /> <br /> The film's story had no momentum. Most scenes do not push the story forward at all, but only gather realistic sets of characters that later appeared at the end of the climate. She had the potential except for not wanting to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Danielle Grant and John Robin Pitz will believe that "once you get your Hollywood, you can not get out." Yes correct! That is why many people launch in Hollywood.
