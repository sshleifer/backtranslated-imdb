For each series of programs you make to TV, 100 ideas, 50 written texts, 15 trial versions, and one, only one, are created. From this selection process, we believe that the end product must be the straw of the crop, and for other reasons many ideas can be rejected to provide us with a single television series. <br /> <br /> So go with the real blood. All the stars were in a state of alignment, and what began as a series of novels turned into an idea, a play, a pilot, and finally a series. Unfortunately, the journey may sometimes be long and along the way there are many turns that eventually change what was good and clean and show that the production feel that it will be the best for the ratings. What a mistake, they are often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of an innovative concept evolving into one of the poorest story lines, the worst representation, and the smartest sub-schemes like anything in modern TV history. Its international crew is struggling with relatively unknown actors to create their voices, but they continue to falter in their false southern dialects. Alan Paul's wishes are not too secret for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) to provide us with a new nude game every week, although she often has nothing to do with telling the story. Tara, the angry black woman, failed to communicate and secretly found herself in the hope that the shepherd would come out quickly before entering another speech about the white repression while attending the glorious death ceremony of the Confederate continent. Sam finds Suki's suppressed love, and suddenly we think he needs to watch her morning, noon and night despite years of working with her and avoid any such relationship. <br /> <br /> As for the vampire Bell, he quickly surrendered his high moral ground at the first opportunity to make love with Sookie and had no problem with making her quick snack (although she is still fairly safe). Other vampires are not like Bill but want to be accepted by the public when they see neighborhoods as happy meals with legs. <br /> <br /> Despite doing my best to suffer during the first six episodes, I have come to realize that no matter how long a bad show lasts, it is still bad. Things die for some reason, even the vampires. Maybe this show for.
