Brief summary: This film deplores everyone who touches it. This mean that you. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that I am not an extremist, and this may be funny for a few minutes. Representations are not bad. But overall it's just boring and funny is not funny. Some simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these films exist only to pull the last few dollars from Laurel and Hardy, which is now brand-free. Producers can not really consider their place in the history of cinema, or their talent. This is what bothered me most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter loved it, so I also failed as a mother;)
