There are some previous comments here about the abundance of click clich√©s all the time - and I fully agree with both regarding the personalities and dialog box. <br /> <br /> I read about Elizabeth Berkeley's awful performance in the Unforgettable Girls, and her performance here, though not bad, is hardly the worst fare level in Lifetime. There was no hint of depth to her character, but maybe there was not. If so, it would put the film in a completely unbalanced state, because there was no hint of depth or charisma - not any effect - in any character, performer or image. <br /> <br /> The manager's handling of Liz's primary complaint after kissing her in the room was laughable. Her initial husband's reaction and advice (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's friend in his car gave him a smarter and smarter movement, and hell, he had a mental challenge). <br /> <br /> The incredible, disrespectful lawyer (sorry for the repetition) The false student's father actually did something praiseworthy in his performance: it was both funny and disquieting at the same time, and this was not a remarkable achievement. Her lawyer was more than the other maniacs, and is not known in the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (frankly, I enjoyed this part), the police were a group of non-sensitive oats, so I relied instead on Barney Fife, without Andy, to deal with all the law enforcement and investigations in your community. I know that most of the fact-like police lack, to a certain extent, sharpness, intelligence, and sympathy for the level shown by most of the characters in the "law and order" series and the like - but the blood of this level appears to be "age." <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of "story within a story" fascinated by Josh's thriller as a "victim" of his teacher. This script performance in the story was worse than its overall performance in the main story. This was an achievement, such as moving from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This unbridled attitude - in real life - had to be resolved in about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting between the teacher and the school authorities, with the husband concerned. But then it would have prevented the continuation of the fabricated drama, leaving an empty film for an hour in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (the writers) here, proved that with their end, they could do worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "corrected", this was accomplished in almost every 45 seconds, with no indication of measures that might be coming in any "real world" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they were able to Find a kind of way towards recovery. <br /> <br /> This presentation is 2 *; second "*" because it contains some mild "charm".
