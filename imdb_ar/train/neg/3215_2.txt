The film contains one nude scene: a man sits on the edge of the bed, with his genitals exposed open in the middle of the screen. It's a very long scene. what is the point? I think it was supposed to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it was not funny to stare at what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool. None of the characters are so lovable. Audrey Tatu is nice, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie. I expected to be charming and new but it was frustrating. She wondered if the director belonged to a French family educated in the crust, and he looked at these characters. <br /> <br />
