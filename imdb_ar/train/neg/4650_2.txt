With a group of eminent British actors and a fascinating photography of Britain in the 1950s, I was hoping and expecting to be more enjoying this film. Unfortunately, I found myself adhering to it for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how horrible it was. I have to watch thousands of old films, and I'm always ready to be a product of their time, but that was really hard. <br /> <br /> As others have noticed, the main problem is that no one seems to know what he wants to be: a nice romantic comedy, a comedy, or a musical. I was a bit reckless when Jenny Carson suddenly broke into a song for about 15 minutes! It can not be believable at any level, be it the same story or the fact that Daisy does not seem to be experiencing any threat to her at any time. Among the other aspects that challenged credibility, Donald Cinden was cast as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake) and the fact that he had Diana Dors for his fianc√©e and did not seem to have any interest in her. Dors! Come on!) And an ironic scene in the publisher's office. The whole thing is absurd in the worst way possible. <br /> <br /> If you have to choose a favorite scene, this scene will initially be with this wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after all that the way has gone down considerably.
