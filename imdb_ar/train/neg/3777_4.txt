Flat-panel computer images that have no soul on less than stunning backgrounds revive a story that is terribly predictable in this film. Nothing at all surprises you, you can even figure out when the singing of Brian Adams will come, which is always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, the horse spirit, is annoying when a voice tells what's going on. There is no need for narrative, because everything that happens is really clear. You can even find out what horses are saying, although all you do is hoot. That would be good, but all the horses issued the same sounds altogether - one sound to warn, another to grieve, one to laugh, and so on. There is no difference between the sounds of horses. <br /> <br /> Such a movie, though. It is pesky enough for a family to sit and watch, and there is little risk that anyone will be afraid. If you do not have something else you want and want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is not recommended.
