Dieter Boehlin, the famous music composer in Germany and a slightly tragic pop producer such as "You Are My Heart, You Are My Soul" felt the need to recount his story - and confidently decided to appoint a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a vague picture of it. He did not deny that he was a selfish idiot but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. There are no words that he probably hit his ex-wife and ended up in hospital. However, she was written in a funny and highly successful way after appearing as a sworn member of the German version of American Idol - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This is the end of the story - it really is. In the noise of the television program "Idol" mentioned is called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (DSDS abbreviated), someone must have come up with a terrible idea to produce a film from the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I seldom saw a film trying hard to be funny and completely failed. None of the gags really hits this point. The voice of Naddel and his modern style immediately stirred my nerves even though Verona's voice should have done more. Clear, childish, predictable and protracted gags destroy any motivation to watch this film until its end in a few minutes. The film's content is adapted to a dirty film written by a ghost writer based on the ideal Bohlen memory. They could use this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be satire, but it failed. The story is quite unimportant, and the fact that the background sound is Bohlen himself ensures that the entire film has nothing naive at all. <br /> <br /> No wonder it was bad for a movie version. The possibility of rotting this object in some archives was very high until recently when the DSDS season proved to be a modest success. With "friendly" help from the biggest yellow press in Germany "BILD" and the desperate situation of the RTL TV station to get something in the program while still unbeatable offer "Wetten dass ...?" The film is played on the second channel, and the film finally reached the TV - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with more fun and a story worth searching for. /> <br /> So: 2/10
