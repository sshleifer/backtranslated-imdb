A number of brides are mysteriously killed while they are at the altar, and their bodies were stolen on their way to the morgue. Journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. I discovered that before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposed to be from the groom) and containing a powerful drug surrendered to them. Patricia was told that the lizard had first grown up by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded house, with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by placing the brides in a suspended state, and using the glandular fluid to keep his wife small forever. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) is trying to force Dr. Lorenz through a fake wedding, eventually leading Patricia to the clutches of the mad doctor. The film had a very good opening roll, but basically ended up creating a lot of footage and other vulnerable scenes. The actors are respectable, Valters and Coffin deserve the best, but this is life. Russell steals the show (even with the seduction of Lugosi - who does not offer one of his memorable memorable performances, even taking his individual pictures) in the portrait of Countess Lorenz plays a role in the characterization of many of the typical features of many of Hollywood's current films. Weak and frantic ends as well. Classification, based on B films, 4.
