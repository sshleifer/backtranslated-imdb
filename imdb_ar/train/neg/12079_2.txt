The poor would roll around in his grave if this dreadful German television could play its classic play. It is clear that little money has been spent on it. A group of risers moves on the stage, a platform, and some columns randomly placed as a group. The film was dubbed in English, where the English voice actors sometimes tapped their lines. The whole production was incredibly dark and so dismal feeling. And where was Fonterbras in this film anyway? MST3K gave this unfortunate production the treatment it deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I hope that this film will not be in the first place.
