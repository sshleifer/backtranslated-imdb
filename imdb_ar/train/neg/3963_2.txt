How many dim times should we see where a panic walks in the background and culminates through mirror reflection? Has been completed in more than twenty films in modern memory and fourteen times in this film volatile and weak performance. There were only terrifying moments to appreciate .... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two people. Speaking of characters, the representation was flat like Diet Cook in 64 oz. The cup you're extracting from. The side-effects of many Scooby Doo drawings could have been pulled. There was a sheriff, an old man. There was an eccentric eccentric living in the backyard with the Alabama roll. Lots'o'characters with no development. The most disturbing picture was the image of a dead child at first. But instead of exploring the murder of the child, which would have been fun, they told us that she died and that her parents had difficulty reconciling her death with society and with each other. When they arrive in the cabin, the scenes rarely flow together .... with pictures flashing to the dead daughter that has been intervened here and there. Oh ... and strange sounds too exaggerated. You know what I mean .... the creaking of the doors that open on their own, the cockroaches in the forest, Yada Yada Yada. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen it before. Again, you'll see the amazing door that opens in the movie again and again. Note to the manager: Scary scene is scary only if not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think about these things before you describe them as "wrapped!"
