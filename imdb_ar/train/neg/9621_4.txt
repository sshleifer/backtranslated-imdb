I was dying to see this once I saw the funny and ridiculous MEATBALLS poster that it must have the best spelling at all. What a wonderful idea about spelling - this kind is pervasive. Unfortunately, the final product (as I think everyone is probably aware of) is an index of missed opportunities, and offers that are not fully available (and thankfully!) For some very fun and inspiring bits. Janine Garafolo, very startling, looks very bad here, perhaps because she is struggling uncomfortably to make her flat play funny. David Hyde Pierce is very sad to watch, and tries to be funny and look like a nerd Castro. Molly Shannon is very funny. Just seeing her makes you laugh, but her clip fails in the snowball to something hysterical. Paul Rod had wonderful adolescent behaviors and was as exciting as hell, while the other players were really funny (unskilled). I think the problem is that the director does not move things right. It starts at a very dead end, this sets monotonousness. But when things are allowed to be really surprised (the drug sequence is the second most entertaining in my life throughout the year, the first time also comes in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL Over the GUY complains about the movie IN & OUT), it's just funny. I wanted this film to work badly, but it did not work. The 1981 clothing and design is ideal for 99.9%, and the very few used songs are also ideal. This ends up as a mediocre MAD TV episode, complete with depressing schematic drawings.
