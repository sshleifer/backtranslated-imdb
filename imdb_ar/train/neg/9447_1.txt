Most movies I can sit on easily, even if you do not particularly like the film. I'm the kind who recognizes wonderful movies even if you do not like the genre. This is my first film I could not see it. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've watched a lot of movies. The acting is fine (Myers is good as a cat, it's really annoying). The silly songs that the cat sang were dull and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The plot continues, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The "ingenious" parental statements are repulsive, not funny (I remember some horrible comments about a garden shovel being compared, well, some kind of people called "ho"). Although the film is really short, it only looked forever. do not waste your time. I know young people who hate this film. If children are unable to stand up, I do not know how adults can. I would like to smoke more about this film but I do not feel so far wasting time writing this review about it. I hated him! So, in short, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest rating I've ever made in my life.
