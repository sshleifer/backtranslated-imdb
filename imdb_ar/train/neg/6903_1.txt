The new Zealands film is probably the worst ever. <br /> <br /> The Jokes are not funny. It is used from other films and just a small atom. Acting is bad despite the presence of wonderful actors <br /> <br /> The story is monotonous and boring. More cheeses, then Pizza Chicks Pizza Cheesecake lovers like acting 1000 times ago <br /> <br /> I watched this when it was shown on TV but it was boring and could only stand 30 minutes from it. <br /> <br /> This movie absorbs <br /> <br /> you do not see, <br /> <br /> See the paint instead of Java
