It was the only scene that made me laugh, as the viewers with Christopher were walking in it (the director of the crazy movie) the rest of the film was just boring. At the first hour or so, nothing really happened. Jokes that are supposed to be funny are not so zeta jones and dougas is overacting.Julia roberts does a routine job of the previous ugly duck (yes right!) In the next girl (where did you see this before?) Who gets the guy. What can happen with the main characters. If cusack really fell into the building in a suicide attempt, it would have been a more comfortable movie to watch.
