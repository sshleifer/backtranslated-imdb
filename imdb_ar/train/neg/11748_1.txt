This movie should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The story line may be clicked if the film has more funding and a book that would have cut the scenes of the nonsense and fatalities that parents have warned them about. But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was something like the drive through the filmmaker, this movie would have sprung from it. He reminded me of many of the quick films that were released in the 1960s - bad script and filming. <br /> <br /> The only reasonable characters in the entire film were the waiter and the sable. The rest of the film was easily possible by middle school children. I give this film one rating because it is really awful and I left my whole family feeling cheated. My advice - I do not see it !!!
