This step was on TV last night. I think full of time, because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some boobs and ass at first and somewhere around half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is very silly for words. "Wolf", if that is what you can call, barely shows that he is saving his teeth completely. When the presentation is complete, you can clearly see that they have some trainees working on the CGI, because the wolf runs as if it were running in a vicious circle, and the CGI fur seems to be linoleum, all glossy :) The film is filled with hole and blood, and you can easily determine who will be killed / cut / eaten afterwards. Even if you like this kind of cumbersome movie, you'll be disappointed, it did not do a good job at it. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start working on the actors ... very fantastic lines and girls yell at all about every 5 seconds. But again, if someone asked me to do something bad just to give me a few dollars, then where did you come from? <br /> <br /> The horror is boring and funny in general.
