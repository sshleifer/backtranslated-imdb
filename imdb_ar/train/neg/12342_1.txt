Anyone familiar with my reviews on the online movie database will know that I can be angry from time to time. There are a lot of movies that I do not like, and for some inexplicable reason, I felt the need to review. However, if someone is curious to see the worst film name I have ever seen, do not look beyond Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this title takes no. 1 Awesome movie. I can not believe I made this already from the beginning of this claw to the end! <br /> <br /> It is clear that the young Frankenstein flavor was captured from Mel Brooks, but where this film was a funny amusing in the tradition of horror films, this one is a tense and misleading attempt to gain laughter from the awkwardly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Bigley Jr. seem ashamed to be here as a couple of journalists in the modern era of Transylvania (they may have realized early on that they were doomed to failure). During their research, they face all the main monsters of the favorite horror of the past, such as vampires, wolves, and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is able to brave this movie to its end may pray for the sake of being driven through their hearts to relieve them of the suffering of boredom. It is a rare sign in the careers of all involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it leads to amazing entertainment.
