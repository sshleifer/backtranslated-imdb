This is your Priyadarshan Model movie - a group of zigzag characters on a silly mission. The climax of his signature has a full set of film defying and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit on hidden money. Whether it was a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director became ridiculously unpredictable. Do not get me wrong. As cliches may be slutful of his films, I usually enjoy comedy. However, in most of his previous films there was actually some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri are noteworthy). Now, his movies are fading because he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushri Data looks great. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and Char is not better off. Conal Khimo is fine, and Joshi Sherman is the best.
