Mirror. The Mirror (1990) is a lame film. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who do you know? Maybe you're the one to punish myself by watching a terrible movie one by one. I do not know, I think I needed a hobby during my teenage years. A teenage pariah (rainbow harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. I soon recognized the awesome power of this antique mirror and used it to beat the wrong ones. Movies like this, the energy donor has a bad side effect. This person changes it from inside and out if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> The clutter of a movie was restored for some reason at d.v.d a few years ago. I do not know why they should have left it on the shelf and collected dust. People love this movie some enemy reason. If you do that I would like to know why. Until then, I did not like this movie and I have no reason to see it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
