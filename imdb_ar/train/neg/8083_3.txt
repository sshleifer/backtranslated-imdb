After Richard S. Sarafian, the disaster caused Japanese theaters to stop before coming to the United States and go straight to the video, where they were not seen again until Turner Networks needed something other than commercials to fill time slots from 3am to 6am and found this tape at the bottom From their own bin. The Smithee name should be used when the studio penetrates the film so that the director no longer wants to associate his name with it. But I'm afraid that the Sarafani can not blame the entire studio on the studio. The actors, most of them graduates of the "Overacting 101" program, present one atom line after another. The plot is complicated. Special effects are ineffective. The parts that are not laughable are just plain dull. The text or the book must be good - why would Balance, Mathison, Boyle, or Houston agree to appear? But there was a terrible error from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not bad enough to be so bad.
