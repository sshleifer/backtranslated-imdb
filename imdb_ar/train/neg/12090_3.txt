Although I can see the qualities that can be recovered in this film by intrigue, I certainly thought that the long painful nature of the way I played the scene structure was too much to ask most viewers. The enormous holes in a scenario such as the comment "Your Father Today That Never Explained" made a comment from the mother making it more difficult to try to understand these characters. <br /> <br /> This won the first place at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001 which is a shocking look. Perhaps the French were starved for the film Noir that year and were desperate for something sad like this movie. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the scenes as uncomfortable as possible, but when I was confronted with the inability to connect with the main character, it became too far away for me and kept me completely out of arms. <br /> This is a movie dedicated to fans of Noir, which does not expect any satisfaction from watching a movie once it's over. I liked movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a dream" - which was at least more disturbing but gave the viewer at least something in the way of editing and speed. To see this teacher, the scene of slow and painful silence after the scene became just so redundant that I found it boring - and I really wanted to love this film at every turn.
