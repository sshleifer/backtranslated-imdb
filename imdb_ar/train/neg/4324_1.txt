Griswalds wins the Idiot in the T.V Award. For the game "Pig in a Poke," and fly them all together to Europe where they can cause a stupid disaster after another. Of all the ironies, the strangeness of money laundering, this beats a lot. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was a less than average misfortune, as the wrong family went on a nightmare "holiday" all over the United States. This time, "Look Who Talking" helps to be a disastrous comedy that will upset you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The text of Hughes (with Rob Klan) is horrifying and you wonder why the likes of Chevy Chase and Beverly Angelo have been so horrified by this deadly project that Anthony Michael Hall and Eminem Koka had a feeling of rejection. Even Michael Palin is completely unable to raise the proceedings to any level one might call amusing. <br /> <br /> However, it is inconceivable that the European Holiday would be successful enough to warrant a second supplement! Surely it can not be unbearable like this one. As you know, I have not yet seen a national show of Lambon worth it. <br /> <br /> Monday, 26 December 1994 - T.V.
