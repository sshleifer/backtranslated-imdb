Dell was an unforgettable film brought to the celluloid a great way like Indra Kumar. The film was followed by Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all of whom were wonderful. <br /> <br /> But then every successful director presents some horrible movies with some visits as well. One of these films is Pyare Mohan. <br /> <br /> Although comedy films are well told, they fail to make the viewer laugh. Compared to the kind of comedy films that are produced today, this is stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not watch it. Because pathetic comedy will only make you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie deserves to be missed.
