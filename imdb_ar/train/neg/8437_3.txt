As a great admirer of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first film, "House of Games" starring Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the surface of the film and the lack of credibility. Racism is thrown out without any sense or meaning behind it, in the hope of creating racial tensions that did not materialize to me. The identity is fully reassessed and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of the right taken as a policeman, the leading personality consistently refuses to do a relatively small job that would hurt anyone and could save lives, yet another act is very violent and very illegal, but then the minor still refuses to act. In addition, an incredibly incredible sub-plot involving a man whose family was killed just to obtain a plot point was all presented in horizontal writing, and the policeman's reaction to that limit extends to a great deal of credibility. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting stir from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say the least possible. 3 of 10.
