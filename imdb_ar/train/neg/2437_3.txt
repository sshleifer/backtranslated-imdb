Well, I'll start by recognizing that I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I saw "The Detective" just because I was trying to work my way through the "Greats" list.) If you are, just go, because you will not agree with me. <br /> <br /> What a piece of drought and dated from this absurdity! I would say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it has made me think of the number of films about the Irish Revolution), but as usual, Ford is determined to bury him under over-acting and cheap feelings. I suppose it is somewhat interesting to draw attention for a while in order to see a less smooth transition that has been made from silence to "talk" - the acting styles in some school principals have that endemic endemic quality as early as movies and films feel as if they Play better with the title cards of the operative dialogue. (Of course, the title cards will prevent Ford from repeating all feelings of emotion six times.) What dialogue is usually "Lucky Charms!" The quality is aggravated by the fact that each representative seems to have been allowed to use his personal version of the Irish dialect. Of course, as bad as it is, dialects are useful in reminding us that we are in Ireland because the collections often seem to have been pulled from a German expression that is filmed on the next soundtrack. (It looks like the eagle eye might see some villagers lighting Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> The techniques are changing. Tastes change. So I will not go mad at what this film seems to have earned in its day. But it is not one of the classics that holds up --- more than just a "just warning" about the kind of oversimplification Ford was devoting to his career.
