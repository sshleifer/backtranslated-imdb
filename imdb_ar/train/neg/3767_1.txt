Budget, decent actors ... who know these things were important. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage. The effects are nonsense. Acting is crap. The only thing that could have made this acceptable was a little of the cheap T & A which was wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only outstanding remote quality in this movie is the miserable words. It was as if they had found only seven people on this planet who had never been cursed. Hats! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some dude in a bad suit, go back and look at the old Prom photos. The only way to dust off Bigfoot is to have a big budget and some actors who did not come from Frogballs Community Theater.
