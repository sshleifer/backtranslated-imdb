This movie is terrible if you are interested in it. It's a perfect movie if you're just watching color images dancing across the screen - each without a clear connection to the other. I hired this film because I'm a fan of David Bowie, and I really appreciate the musicals. In the end, Bowie was in the film for ten minutes, and the songs and dance sequence were scattered and left something desirable. The morale of the story was really puzzling. I could not tell whether it was racial issues in London in the 1950s or not selling. During the first half of the film, I laughed at how cowardly he was, but I liked the "not selling" message. When the blacks began to kill, I thought my tape had been corrupted. Maybe she hired half of two different films? No, there was a song "Keep White Britain" and a dance sequence. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write music about. At least, musical music can not be described as "incubated" as I have said several times in this review. In general, I say that this film can perform much better if it makes its decision and casts better actors. (David Bowie put in his hand for a long time!) My appreciation: C-
