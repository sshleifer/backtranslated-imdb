Sorry. Someone has to say it. This really is / was a boring film. Maybe worthy, but boring though. I almost cried with boredom when watching it. The representation is pretty awesome, the story is sketchy and predictable, and the result and action of the cameras are absolutely standard and not exciting. It's one of those movies that you are not allowed to hate (because it's about people with disabilities), but I hate it and I think everyone does it. It is interesting that the critics were nice with this film. I suppose they are also not allowed to be objective. This was achieved to win prizes - which I remember as I did. But it was neither interesting nor amusing. I have not seen the play so I can not compare.
