The film looks great on paper. A romantic comedy film in which the passionate lover is dragged into a thrill of cross-gold smuggling in general, especially with this excellent romantic actor. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that Laurence Kasdan gives his star simply too much rope even though they go duly and hang themselves. The reason may be to blame Adam Brooks but you would expect better than Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda.
