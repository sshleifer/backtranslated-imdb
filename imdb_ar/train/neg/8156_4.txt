Prom Night 2 A good horror film, but Night Prom is better. These films revolve around how Marie Marie Lou died in 1957 at the hands of her boyfriend and then returned after 30 years to avenge. The best actor in this film is Michelle Ironside and the stars of the film are actors and other actors such as Justin Lewis (I), Wendy Leon, Lisa Shrague and Richard Munit (I). There are some good scenes like when you kill Mary Lou the girl who is trying to hide in her wardrobe crush the cabinets together and how to be a student on the computer, and Mary Lou to hit him to death. Above all, it's a good horror film, and my rating is 4 out of 10.
