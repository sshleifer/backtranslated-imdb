I did not expect much from this movie, which is a small fun diversion. Wuthering Heights can be converted into a reasonably modern story - nice, soapy, melodramatic and interesting. But this film decided to get rid of the talents of people involved in a simplified version, so that the source material was settled to the extent that it is surprising that they have the courage that they call Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is the story of people who are essentially undesirable, most of whom are not sympathetic, and often cruel to one another. It changes the character of some characters - Isabel, for example, in the novel, had no poor bone in her body - she was stripped of blind idealism and turned into a prostitute whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically torments most people on his way, but in this version Katherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog box is trivial and one wonders how actors were able to present any of them with straight faces. Instead of deep or actual emotions, we know it means something when you scream in the face of someone. I read criticisms of the early 1990s of Emily Brontez and Wirthing Heights, which included Ralph Finis and Juliette Pinochet, saying that they turned a darkly dark Gothic story into a tornado. Comments are pretty good, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver the wonderful beach sandwiches that really fit the bad music.
