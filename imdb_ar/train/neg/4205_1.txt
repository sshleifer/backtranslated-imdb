The warning is so written that you think yourself why he acted on the ground a rising and approving actor like David Arquette agrees to be there. It must be one of the weakest plots I have ever seen and without any teaser at all, they are on the brink of boring. He is swaying with a shocking conclusion that seems to be happening only because the director is bored and just wants to finish quickly to go home for dinner. stay away!.
