This film is so wonderful that it makes the angels lose their wings. Chuck tried to make more crossover efforts, such as his work in Chow Fu for NES and a large number of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic horror film industry that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is not one good thing to say about this movie. I saw her a bunch of times when I was very young, but I have to be foolish then, because this film distinguishes all that is fun from the movies and tears them. It's fun to ridicule. I've seen him on the Disney Channel for a while and spent a few minutes in it. Although once the suspense is finished and ironic, it is still overwhelmed by its horror. <br /> <br /> If you see this on TV, try it: Think of watching your movie as you remove all the scenes where the power of magical magic powers is used. If you do, it becomes like a movie about a homosexual chasing a child and sucking it up. This is somewhat funny, and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A terrible example of a movie. No, unless you look to mock him, watch this movie.
