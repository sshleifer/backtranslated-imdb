... never thought of a film worthy of a prize! But this film is frankly the worst film I have ever seen. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but it seems that the story of the story since the DVD box is quite predictable. It is not a mystery, nor an attractive film of events. Does not include any excitement, if that is what the remote address might suggest to any of you. This is just not no. Do not waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a group of young people in a kind of gothic where the killer grows up, where he stalks the killer. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makowski makes worse than Nick Stahl.
