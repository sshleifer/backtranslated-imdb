The Frankenstein Curse adheres faithfully to Mary Shelley's story to one word of title, which will not be too bad if the changes are good at all. The tragedy of the creature that destroys the Frankenstein family has been completely eradicated and replaced ... nothing. The heart and the moral center of the story went. It does not help that Frankenstein is a mortal murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is essentially a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even if we take it on its own terms, this is rubbish: a thin, roaming film featuring a bright-looking creature with a story of a pudding bowl. As Hamer's first horror films, directed by Terence Fischer and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the history of horror is safe. But it is folly.
