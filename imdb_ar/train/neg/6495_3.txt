I hired this film based on the advantages of what appeared in the trailer, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack cooperates with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a film, it will be the end. I do not think I watched a movie like that make the LSD trip look like a ring from Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It is a set of specific pieces where characters flow out of reality, or different realities, and the film does not culminate in anything until the last 5 minutes, where it is quite surprising. I wrote a tough review on my film review blog, which basically gives everything, and I will not do it here. It's a good cinematic piece, and the soundtrack written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, let me say this, if there is one recovery feature for this movie, it is music. It fits perfectly. Some dialogue is incredibly good, and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed parts of this film, I really enjoyed it, and once I got to the end, it would actually fall to know what was really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to go into two hours of madness to reach a prominent point, which reduces the impact of the entire film. <br /> <br /> Give it 3 out of 10 for a simple fact that the real problem with this film is not acting, it's everything.
