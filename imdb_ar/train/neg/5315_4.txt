Cole, a space-bound space prisoner, is able to hijack the space shuttle and escape to America's Forest where he, along with some new friends found, is trying to escape Alienator, a female cyborg machine. Created one year after the best film of Fred Olen Rai's Hollywood Husky Hawkers, this film can only feel a little idle, like a low budget like this one, but not as much as I loved it. None of the actors really stood up to me, and the film was fine for the unremarkable viewer during the rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's all very good. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D + <br /> Where I saw: Showtime suspense
