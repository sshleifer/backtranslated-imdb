I have watched this film, and at times, I was concerned that this film "saw me". Munchie pollutes the 'farce' for years to come. Re-watching Star Wars, do not see Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I talk to their parents now), I will not allow you (for my child) my child (your child) ever to participate in this video festival of fictitious zombies. The hint of a demonic Munchy is likely to begin with his participation in the "Doh" cooled view. He is evil, foreign, cruel, and utterly malignant - like a man who has made flesh, invisible to adults, and seduces children with the lifestyles they can not afford (without income possible with years of self-denial and wise supervision). He is a street vendor for easy answers and wrong ideals. It is all morally conscious viewer is not. It is Ron Popil of Satan. <br /> <br /> Original (I mean this literally and figuratively, focusing on the former) that this movie did not make the format move to DVD. I hope this kind of "yellow film industry" has died with a sad death on the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention it. It comes a lot.
