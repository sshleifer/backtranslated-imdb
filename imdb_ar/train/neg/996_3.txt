Revenge is one of the favorite subjects in the film. Morisso, "The futility of revenge" is one of my favorite subjects in the film. After seeing Gaspar Noy irrevocably (2002), I was expecting a more relevant expression. Instead, this film is a weak, heterogeneous attempt that reflects only the lack of conviction and concentration in the film. <br /> <br /> * The scene of the end, a scene of rape / torture without mention of males, has encountered at least revenge revenge of a suicide bomber. However, the film does not follow this up. Instead, the painted scene (which goes beyond the British Royal Army and the brutality of the initial rape, whether in the painting or ritual) is drawn in a gesture of Dawson's face as an expression of regret or "this has not been" In the background. <br /> <br /> My problem in the scene was not a problem of shock, but the problem of confusion about this graphic scene is trying to reach the audience. Disgusted by the brutality of everything? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regretful regret? Apart from this failure The film is really a bit of a baffle that goes way more than substance, characters are thin, chat is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to shoot movies on their own terms, but Descent does not really know what those things are. I was astonished.
