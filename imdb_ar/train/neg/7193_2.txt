I had absolutely nothing to do at the end of last week and was marked with my friends watching a movie ... no movie. Since the only movie we did not see was the Gadget Gadget, we decided to participate. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. This movie may appeal to children only. Oh, it's not like I do not enjoy movies targeting the younger audience. But this film did not have anything at all to draw my attention. If you do not have something to do at home, go to sleep. Better than wasting hard-earned money on this. Go check the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent to a child :)
