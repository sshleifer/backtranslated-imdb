This is a kind of thing that excites only thriller. After all, Felix Crash of Firestein will teach you that Real men do not watch anything by Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to have Truffaut anything to say here. The idea of ​​a voyeur camera was not new. Have we forgotten all the "bicycle thief" from De Sica? Or anything from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is the lengthy metaphor of events, where Truffaut, who spends his free time "shutting his eyes" in movies, destroys the classroom system and is accused of plagiarism (many petty thefts) Eventually he runs away from the social border to make his "own film". Sorry ... I was there and I did it many times for this.
