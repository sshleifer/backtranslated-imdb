If the scale is negative, I'll be happier. Sushmita Sen's vision was nice, and Nisha Kothari had a bright future but the producer and director spoiled anything in this story. Choosing angles, choosing lighting, and everything distracts from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and dances did not cause you to strain your ears from your head, first. It was possible to make the film twice at 1.25, and it was very good, like "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer did not go into this direction, even if the "city dwellers" found the backbone and wanted to help. This film failed on many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, elegance, lighting, script - naming any aspect of this film - was bad - perhaps the food of the food contractor was very bad. I have not seen Indian films (Bollywood) for 6 years, something that happened badly.
