There are often identical pairs (in the general sense of the word) in Huston films: "African African" "Heaven knows Mister Allison" "The roots of Heaven" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the jisha" Another, so to speak. Japanese objects seemed to be modern at the time, such as Sayonara's "World of Susie Wong" and "Moon Moon Cafe" as a witness. Huston's effort may be the worst in this fairly bad group (except perhaps "Susie"). John Wayne fits ideally with the world of Ford, in a Huston-like bull in a Chinese shop. His Japanese partner is very nice. The dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who absolutely like every action in Huston need to choose this, among all his other brilliant movies.
