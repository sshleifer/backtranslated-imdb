This classic film was rated on sentiment rather than on any kind of filmmaking. It moves from the unlikely to the unreasonable, from the unreal to the funny. <br /> <br /> The absurd plot is about the attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu ruler to save a third soldier captured by the Indian rebels. In the next scene, we watch a full fugue with a drum and a pipe in an ambush. In the British army, the sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if he does, he does not try that with one other soldier and an Indian server when there is a full regiment at hand. The Indian rebels are so unbelievably qualified that it is laughable ... There are hundreds of them but they can not detain their prisoner or kill the rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing stones of stone from the battles on the rebels, who are scattered around the foot of the mountain in an ambush ... One has to have an eggplant of the mind that thinks this will lead to no harm. After Cary Grant was shot during the shooting of the rescued prisoner, he was lying on the ground looking around at the water boy ... barely the actions of someone shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows up a trumpet (which does not come from anywhere) to knock the alarm ... This is what he does by standing high on the wall so that he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed tears while he keeps trying to sound more notes during the shooting It is frequently divided into a trumpet call to a weak scream ... instead of blowing the trumpet while hiding behind the lid as does anyone with a hemisphere. This scene deservedly deserved in comics. If they want to make Buster Keaton, they should set Keaton and do it better.
