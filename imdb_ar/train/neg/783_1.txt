I watched this show and did not find it funny at all. Perhaps the first episode. I recently realized that ABC is playing a lot of stupid offers these days as it moves down the station. All the characters in this show are very bad actors, but even if they are good, the jokes and the script are very shocking and will continue to lead to a low supply. I would like to say that I think this offer will be canceled, but I think that ABC's performance is very bad for the quality of the programs they play, they may keep this offer just because it is average compared to them.
