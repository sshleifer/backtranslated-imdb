I saw this film only because I was very impressed with Olivier Martinez in Swat. But this is not SWAT. Swat was a plot and some characters were loved and meaningful. The bullfighter was none of these. <br /> <br /> I had to realize that it could not be good, after all, Michelle Forbes was so bad that she always had a starring role. <br /> <br /> One poster here called the film incoherent. Another called it the worst film ever. Both gave the film a lot of credit. I'm very happy because I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel my discomfort. <br /> <br /> IMDb needs to include "0" in rating "Rate this movie", only for movies like this one.
