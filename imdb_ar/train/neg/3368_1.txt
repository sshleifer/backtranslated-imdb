For film lovers who have never heard of Sherley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and have never seen Robert Wise's 1963 production with Julie Harris, this new version looks very bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have, it is just awful. <br /> <br /> Misbehavior (what Neeson was thinking?), computer misrepresentations and fades away from the Jackson story of the ruin of this remake. <br /> <br /> Work for you and rent your original movie. Still scares effectively without special hokey effects. Professional representation and certification. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, 1963 is more closely followed.
