This film was pathetic at all. I left a pitiful scenario and the lack of any story just watching three dribble losers on bikini kids. Sometimes I felt I was watching a ring of Pevez and Boothide. I could not even sit through the entire film. Imran al-Hashemi is disappointed, and Hersheta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Selena Gaitley was not bad. The only interesting part of the film is a spoof for Io Malik and his obsession with Chiaras. It was very hilarious. The songs of "Sini Ne" and its revised version were really good. You can always rely on the lip lock of Imran and lip sync. All in all, Imran seems to have no good text from Bhatts to support him this time.
