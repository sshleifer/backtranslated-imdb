I realize that this film was designed for children, and as a parent I sat in several films that are not particularly interesting, but I appreciate it from a constructive point of view on how to receive my children. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and monitor the quality of entertainment they see, so there must be something that the adult audience likes at some level even in children's movies. Disney has always realized this and that is why it is very difficult to understand how such a full piece of name can be tolerated. <br /> <br /> Technically, sound editing is awful and all the sounds of dialogue seem too much. Mdbalij and unnatural. Personally, I hate that, but it was horrifying to think that the dialogue itself looked as if it was written at the age of 12 for a school project. The "acting" reminded me of a play and none of the children's actors had any kind of emotion in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now, before I go out like a geek with a video that measures a children's film using an adult yard stick, the only thing that can save even the worst film for children is a positive message. Neither side determines how to deliver the message as long as the message is correct. Let's walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, do not worry, you will inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any contest just because you "know" you. <br /> <br /> For my favorite artist, the last remaining message in the film: <br /> <br /> It is okay to disobey power figures and do what you think is true.
