In the end it is very silly and useless. Yes, there is a gold cage metaphor, but most children may miss it. Forget about. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation, as we expect it, is super-realistic. It is best to describe the plot as thin but stubborn. Although the end seems arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> The world of sewer vice is a disgusting reflection of the world above, and in some way, wealth and money seem to be a lot more. Oh yes, there is a romantic interest that the female is smarter, more intelligent and sophisticated between the couple - this in itself quickly transforms into a dull (opposite) pattern. Maybe your kids will love though.
