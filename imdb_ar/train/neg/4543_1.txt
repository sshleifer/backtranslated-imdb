I read the book and the book was fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film, it's a trend, a scenario, and an intolerable representation. It has been stymied by the lack of a scenario that can not be followed by the novel, a novel that contains all the procedures, simplicity and courage to illustrate the story of a wonderful story based on the facts. Why this film has not been released to the general public in most cities. I will not recommend this film to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply put, one of the worst adaptations I have seen has turned into a less exploration of the sky on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was really the highlight. But, how can it fail when it is filmed in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flipping.
