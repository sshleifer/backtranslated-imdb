I have seen this movie once in a long time, and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around Preston Waters, a mischievous comet, who always seems to have been ignored by the family and who always seems to be short on criticism. All this changes when a bank thief runs over a Preston bike and passes a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank thief who gave him the check). Preston then buys a palace and says he works as an assistant to a mysterious and rich supporter named Mr. Macintosh (named after its computer). After that, he became mad with money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this looks like a great idea. However, it is on screen one of the most movies I have ever seen. For one thing, it's incredibly incredible. I know that some parts of the film were supposed to be wonderful, but I draw the line for a twelve-year-old boy who goes out with a 30-year-old woman and takes charge of the small fortune of the imagined person. Also, this film was shallow with poor representation, a predictable plot line and less memorable characters. The characters were either cheese or over it, annoying or backward. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, go to this movie.
