After watching the trailer for this movie and knowing that Spike Lee was running, I was excited to hear the event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I was expecting a lesson in history more than anything else. What I got was some exciting acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes of movies that actually had anything with Sam's son. I think the film was not about Sam's son, but it was a peek at the summer of 77. He made me disappointed. <br /> <br />
