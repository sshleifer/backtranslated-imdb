Seriously, what is this? Hopper has made classic films like the Texas Shainsu Massacre, and then made this terrible film, What Happened? Do you dunk the crack a bit? This movie revolves around some sane named Sam who has the ability to set fire, (firestarter, anyone?) The acting was disappointing, the plot was nonsense, and the special effects were very nonsense, looked like something from the seventies. Van Damme should be delighted because Deraille is no longer the worst film ever, and what was it with the end? He began to glow blue, turned into a glowing blue bubble, sucked the fire of his girlfriends, and ended the film. what was that? HUH? When the movie ended, I hoped the DVD would burn automatically from pain, <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not think, thank me later.
