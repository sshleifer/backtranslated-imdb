I think this movie was a great hit at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first film since "Beverly Hills Cop", and at the time was hot. Given that one of them achieved more than 200 million and that it was R and this got about 80 million and that he was saying pg it was not all that popular. I was never a fan of Eddie Murphy, so maybe that was another reason I did not care much about at all. This one has Eddie as a kind of search for lost children. The golden child or the world must be in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but it is as bad as it is not compared to the special effects. I've seen better things done in the seventies than some of the things that this guy has done. Ray Harahausen did a better job. The main reason why you see such a movie is Eddie, unfortunately it is not very funny in this film at all, and it seems stupid to put it in scenes of the type of "Raiders of the Lost Ship." I think they were hoping for a fish from the water effect, but for me it did not work.
