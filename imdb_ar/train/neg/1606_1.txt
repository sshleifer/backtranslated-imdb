In this film, Chavez's supporters (either Venezuelans and non-Venezuelans) lie in a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict began because Chavez announced that many of the best workers in PDVSA would be released only for political issues. <br /> <br /> They have not said anything about more than 96 television channels interrupted by Ch치vez in just three days in "CADENA NACIONAL". Each of which lasts about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the announcement made by General En Jeff Lucas Rincon Romero, the Inspector General of the Army, a traditional supporter of Chavez. So far, despite his declaration, he is Minister of Interior de Khosticia. After Ch치vez's return, he served as Minister of State Affairs (equal to the United States Secretary of Defense). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Ch치vez's orders to shoot at the concentration of peaceful people who were calling for elections. They did not say anything about the people in this concentration killed by Ch치vez's supporters (either civilians or military official forces). <br /> <br /> They present some facts in the wrong order, in order to lie. <br /> <br /> They have not said anything about Venezuelan civil society, which is what he calls so far to hold elections to resolve the crisis and Chavez's actions in order to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you .... this movie is just a lot of lies or big lie.
