I find myself wondering about the opinion of the people who gave this 10 in it. This film faces a very difficult time to follow and / or stay on a plot of land. If someone tells you that it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% of the weird drama and 2% comedy. All the actors are performing superbly, undeniably, but it seems to have lost something somewhere. I do not know whether the original text was good and had to be modified or not. This had potential, and instead it was a real volatility. I really want to get an hour and a half invested in this movie, but the place of renting the video does not come back on time. Save your money and see something else.
