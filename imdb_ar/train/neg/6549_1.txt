I do not want to be interested, but this film surprised me a lot. During the entire movie, you like ... Deer ... What is this movie all about? I do not get animations at all. Maybe this film will be suitable only for those who belong to the eighties. During the film, a group of people came out. After the film, many people said, "That's all?" Frankly, I can not believe that this film won the Best Children's Film Award. If you are considering watching this movie, I strongly recommend not to do so. You will regret it. I'm not kidding. You will find that you are wasting your time and money as you watch it.
