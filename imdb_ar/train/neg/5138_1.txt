I saw the ringtones because of the buzz surrounding it. Well, I can not imagine anyone who likes this movie because it is bad and bad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, everyone who makes this film knows nothing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two kinds: motion film (guns and criminals) and horror (live scarers). When criminals are killed one after the other by a glamorous look, these two types automatically cancel each other because they are first criminals and those who care about the criminals, and second, because they are stupid criminals to take off! Having a zombie scarecrow goes after them just does not work here. Where is the horror at that? I wanted the criminals to die in a terrible and painful death. <br /> <br /> But the story is so poorly constructed that this marriage of species, which could have been original if treated well with gels. We have simply left a group of very many criminals and a host of scandals, which are "alive" for whatever obvious reason filmmakers thought. Making things worse is the fact that filming is very bad (like TV), and worst of all, full sets of dialogue are told on the CBs, and we are constantly hearing an abnormal conversation speaking through unconnected images as if we are seeing some type of radio program . This part was really bad. The manager must have been shot at once to come up with such a stupid idea! I can not tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, the criminals at SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly appears, gets luggage and is full of money and hay (yes, straw) in his huge open wound, others ask, "What medicine is he taking?" After they shot him with tons of bullets, he was unable to kill him (he was "west" of the scuffles ... do not ask ...). Get the idea of ​​a freak, a moron. I've never seen such idiots in a movie. Then there is the girl. I wished that one of the scarecrows killed her quickly because it was painful in the rear. When her father finds a nail on the "cross" scarecrow, she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (malpractice), although the criminals were unable to do so. What a fool! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. They are not scary. Much has not been explained about them. It is just a piece of land in this film full of painting. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley depicts the Scarecrow's face for 30 seconds nonstop and evokes nothing but extreme boredom. This scene with a modern head in the refrigerator. Thanks for the laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this was one of the worst films I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) between the equally sad SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS, the best SILO KILLER monitor again. Yes, the confection is so bad.
