The horror films that appeared in the movie "Schlocky" in the seventies ... gotta. In contrast to today's boring clicks, K-tel's special offers do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This B movie about B movie industry ... went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue plays the role of Queen of B on the hillside, producing a film about a series of horrific murders of a family in her home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like a Gordon Jump with a stand, is photographed on site and on a tight schedule. Ken Kane discovers a book of Tibetan chants that they use in the text to add "realism." Unfortunately, "realism" was something they could have done without it. <br /> <br /> John Cardin, long since he abandoned the quest for the 17th gland (The Unththly), is now looking for a humble presence as a caretaker. He follows his daily work, but he always seems to get out of the way. <br /> <br /> The horror is slowly rising: a dead cat here, John Carradine entered a tomb, finally crowned with seven, yes seven murders. (At least there is a fact in the ad). Sadly, Ghoul did not understand that there was a film made on top of him. How was the faith of the poor to know that those shabby Tibetan chants would actually succeed? Face it, you can not get around the devil's coat and expect him to lie down on it. <br /> <br /> Sterno says he is performing an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.
