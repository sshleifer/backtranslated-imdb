What a disappointment, especially given the budget provided, the available technical resources, and the talent that has been assembled. The basic rule of science fiction / drama is not to create in public a comment rejecting kufr. POA 2001 creates a reasonable start, nursing us, but then Mr. Burton forgets that filmgoers have brains to work. At the top of chimpanzee liberties Helena Bonham Carter, worthless of human incarceration, the ease of their escape, their superior skills in equestrian (this is an astronaut and a set of human primitives suddenly ride the full tilt), instant human rebellion are all incredible. Mark and Leberg never showed any sense of real fear, danger or helplessness in this world that turned upside down. Compared to the original, where Chuck Heston's nudity captured metaphorically his helplessness and utter amazement at the turn of events. The official Walberg uniform maintains his humility, but also maintains his clear sense of management and control of a strange position by nature, and we never ask about his safety. Unlike Heston, it seems that he is not in real danger. Tim Burton should have used some f / x budget for some scriptwriting. In fact, after this fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have ever bothered to settle the threats of scriptwriters and directors. Let them walk. The trained monkeys could have done what I did in the movie Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet that repeated views of this effort will not exist. It could have been a new franchise, a fantastic new step for imagination. Another missed opportunity.
