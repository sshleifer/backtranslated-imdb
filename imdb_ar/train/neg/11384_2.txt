Since Europe started fighting World War II, and until the end of the war, Hollywood (with much government encouragement) has produced a lot of films designed to try to get young people into the army by making a soldier look "cool." This is by far the slowest, which means that a soldier's life is out of action, that you get the best food, that you lie all day and listen to Anne Miller over the radio. I'm younger than to participate in World War II, but I think there was something more. There are more cat logos feeling a conspiracy, and a collection of musical numbers that showcase some of the leading works of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that by 1943, the most na√Øve people in civvies knew that there was more abroad than the stupid hijinks portrayed in this film. Although I am sure it was supposed to be seen as entertainment, I can not help but wonder whether the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war have been entertained or expelled by sacrificing the sacrifices of their loved ones.
