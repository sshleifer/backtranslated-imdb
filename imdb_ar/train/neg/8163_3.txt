I agree with all that people have said about this, but I must add that soundtracks may be the worst music I've ever heard of! There is actual singing during the times when you are supposed to listen to the actors talking! Singing is like a wide version of Danzig singing, "Darkness of the jungle! Oh Darkness of the Dark Forest!" Or anything else that is not threatened. The singer has a terrible rhythm and has been recorded with a triangular microphone over some blended string clips and counterfeit drum beats. It is horrible!! <br /> <br /> Yes, male leads are awful. As well as females. This is one of the bad cases of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! All they say is that you are male or female, only playing stereotypes to the extreme. You make me sick. Sooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children were very resonant in their lines, unable to understand them. Why do ghost children always wear nice little braids in their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? The ghost boys always wear clean pants with shiny little blond hair? It was not scary - stupid. <br /> <br /> Papa's face was flawless and clean so that the face of a man living in a cave was not. Nice beard and bangs, annually. Have you cut those with a knife yourself or have you wandered into the city and moved to the salon? <br /> <br /> A stupid movie.
