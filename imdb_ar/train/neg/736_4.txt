Twenty years ago, five-year-old Michael Hawthorne watched his father kill his mother with an ax on an empty road and later commit suicide. In recent days, Michael (Gordon Cory) calls his girlfriend Peg Stacy Grant and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuel Fugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Bisser) To spend the Halloween in the country with his ancestors in their farm. He asks his friends to wear the costumes of their greatest fear, and with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chive Moon), they will perform an ancient Indian ceremony using the carved wooden doll Morty (Jon Fedele), which destroys their fears forever. Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but there is something wrong and Morty becomes his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "Fear: The Resurrection" is a disappointing and futile downplay that uses an exciting concept to get rid of the deepest fear of every friend before he grows up, but in an anarchic scenario full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated offers, such as Ms. Betsy Palmer; others are very poor, but overall the work is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation for why the doll appears; moreover, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when they all die. It was possible to use low speed over more than fifty minutes to build a better dramatic position. In the end, Michael showed a charm whose father was interested that I did not notice throughout the story. I do not know if the previous reference was edited on a DVD that was released in Brazil with an 87-minute runtime. Special effects are very reasonable for film B. Acoustic Four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Auma Nue de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
