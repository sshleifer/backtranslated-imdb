It seems that this film has a lot of people say it is one of the most brutal acts ever made. Having just seen him, I can say that he does not live up to these claims. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film has already been reduced. But in general, execution was not worthy at all. Even the last scene (something eyeball) is not so bad. I was expecting something crazy, instead, it was less quality than putting it on movies like the ultra-low budget "Violence u!" <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie, not a story at all (though most people will certainly know this) will be disappointed. Al Gore fans will be disappointed because blood and courage are few and far between, contrary to belief. Not to mention that the actress who plays the role of victim may be one of the worst actress in history. <br /> <br /> No matter what people say, this film is not shocking, it is sucked by all things. avoid it.
