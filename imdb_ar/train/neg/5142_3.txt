After Chaplin presented one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, making one of his worst works: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin made about a third of his films. Many of them have experimented with advertising, editing, cams, shooting sites, etc. This happens in a race track where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without payment. Maple Normand is present with her friend too, and enables Chaplin to rid himself of his friends and Mabel. Mabel then falls into the runway without any obvious repercussions on his behavior. Lots of paper scraping here, but nothing else can be recommended for this film to others then watching Chaplin evolve. The printing I have seen has deteriorated badly, which may affect their enjoyment. Can take a look at Charlie Chase. * Of 4 stars.
