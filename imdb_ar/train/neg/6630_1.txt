This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see the night .. On the first day, the expectation and noise was too much for me. But during the first half of the hour, we knew this was a disaster. Not only does it match the noise that was created but also deplores the original bomb. The text had gaps, editing was untidy several times. Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did a good job. Amitabh was fine. The director wanted to portray how bad his character was, but he went abroad a bit, which led to her being strong. Ajay who was particularly smooth in this kind of role was also disappointing. Let's not start yet about the new man Prashant. You would not be proud to start his career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown for a few laughs, could not even get a smile from anyone because of his loud humor and loud voice. Nisha Kothari proved to be one of our worst actresses today. All in all, RGV, which I thought was one of the most gifted and talented directors in India, failed miserably. He faced such a huge challenge and responsibility to redraft what he called the best Indian film ever and made a mess of it.
