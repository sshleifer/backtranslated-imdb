I remember watching this movie back in '86 when it was first released and what a terrible film. The act was terrible and the plot was very flimsy or had to explode in the wind. I think he made me sleep on more than one occasion and I was not tired of remembering it. Please avoid in any way you still have all your teeth that you took out with any anesthesia cos that would be more entertaining. It's a pity that I could not give it a zero or a negative. I wish I had not wasted my money getting this from the video store, all I can say is that the tape was still surprisingly new because the movie was so bad. If I remember I sat down and watched him with a girl I really wanted to go out with her and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake and that's how bad this film is.
