See the original with the same title since 1944! This made for a TV movie, is just a god awful! Although it uses (as far as I can tell) the dialog box is almost the same, it does not work! Is it representation, poor guidance? Well, it's been set up for TV, but why do you see a bad copy, when you put your hands on the original picture? Especially as you will be spoiled for the plot and will not enjoy the original as if you had seen it first! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (they are shorter once), but all are for the worst! Actors that play the parts here, do not fit the bill! You just do not believe them and who can lead Edward J. Robinson of origin? If you like it, just watch it after you see the original, and even then you will be very brave, if you see it! It's almost!
