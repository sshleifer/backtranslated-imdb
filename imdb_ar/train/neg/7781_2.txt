Young Qassim, sexy women, lots of right, a very unconvincing monster rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You think that "monster" will be fun ... but it is not already so. He does Tony Eisley and John Carradine, but in my book makes it worth watching at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Isley pointed out that Herbert Struck took out the bulk of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who took only the footage of his sons Andrea and Glenn (portraying personalities named Andrea and Glenn in his particularly innovative role) ) - received full credit. Given how wonderful the end result is, Strock may have been happy because he was not credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of a television film from mid to late seventies, so I like to leave it in the background again and again. Because entertainment is flat on his face, but as a reminder of another age and type of filmmaking, it is very effective. The only thing missing is chasing cars.
