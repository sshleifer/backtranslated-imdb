I was frankly surprised on your own in the dark. It was so bad, I hardly believe what I saw. There are no characters, there are some stereotypes that walk around and kill. The extent of personality development was to give each character a name and a function, and that is it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many motion scenes have just started on their own, coming from nowhere with a resounding technical track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking, "Where does this happen? Acting was the quality of high school drama, with a hard wooden delivery, as if the actors were read from the cue cards without understanding their lines. The problem of connecting lines became clearer through the design of the terrible sound. The ADR seemed to be registered in an open room. The actors were constantly taking care of their marks and looking almost mechanically at their movements. Therefore, these senseless automations are transferred through a series of unreasonable and confusing scenarios, often without even taking advantage of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. This was happening, now this is happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.
