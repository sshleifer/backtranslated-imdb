This film was badly written, acted badly and very unpredictably. It was a very low budget, and I can understand why it was never released and directed directly to the video. It was not very fun, it was just a complete disaster and I hope to get back an hour and a half! The colors were awful along with the plot that had big holes so you could drive a Mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The same plot was to make the little bride do things she was not actually capable of - what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in this kind of horror. Any better film comes to mind. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
