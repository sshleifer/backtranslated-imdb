Well, I did not have high expectations, but this film is going down to depths I can not imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it was, included a priest for a mysterious order of two members investigating the death of the founder for the sinner. O 'eater allows the Catholics to bring salvation beyond the power of the Church and he is another Khaled in the film with a lot of ennui. Knowing that this has no meaning since then, the Baptist can give you salvation .... and we will give. <br /> <br /> I will plan for a plan that will not give him much: the priest goes to Rome with his companion to invest. He brought with him a mental patient (I do not) who was shot during a riot and who loves him (not one lick of this weight), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Wheeler as a cardinal. They go to Rome, find some terrifying children who do nothing in the film, and meet the anti-pop pop anti-Pope pope known by the drunken Irishman (who is not shown) who provides information by killing people (Oh, btw, he's a bad guy So he has industrial / technical soundtrack) and then ... Um, seriously, I'm not sure. A plot lurking about him. Heath chilling with Sean Eiter, flying to New York with Sean Eiter to spend an overnight, then talking some other stuff then falling off the Pope's fight and ending the movie. (All camera is closed). <br /> <br /> About an hour after the film, one really wonders if anything has happened. In the end, something happens, but you can not be sure it is important and because most drama happens either before or after the day you feel cheated.
