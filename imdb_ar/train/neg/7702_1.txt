I am a black man living in a predominantly black city. However, I have some serious concerns about the work of Tyler Perry. I realize that some people there feel the need to praise it, because it is black and tries to portray a positive image of culture. But I honestly believe that if it were Perry White, the film would have included NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his ass. <br /> <br /> I've been forced to watch this movie a whole new hell lately and every frequent watch makes my blood boil. The characters are badly written and acted. The jokes are very bad, you should tell me that there is supposed to be something funny. I'm just going to break this big heap from the bottom. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. Someone may have some appeal, but no longer. When the only thing they seem to do is hit the children and threaten the adults with violence, they will be less useful than that. It is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife who beat her fiancé was a hurdle. If a woman is too afraid of her husband's death, then why try to escape when he sleeps in bed. It would not make sense for her to leave when he was at work. However, the characters in this arc were so annoying and excited that I hoped he would throw it from the balcony and was idle when he did not. <br /> <br /> Then there are love birds. A bus driver asks a woman by harassing him as he makes his rounds. I could not believe it. I really do not believe when I agreed to go out with him more. But, what takes the cake is that the man who grew up has turned to pebble the gravel in a window and passes notes like an old ten-year-old through a huge bitch. I do not use this term lightly, but that woman had only two positions. Morose victim and mother psychologist. No matter which of these two faces you showed, however, there was one constant. The bus driver will not get any. Married her even without sampling the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is a family reunion scene. Here we have a mother's pregnancy that includes implicit tacit taboos, grinding for grinding, no shirt, overstretched muscles, my ball, plus the wonderful taste of Maya Angelo. When these children were dragged away with their heels and called to meet, was I wrong to give them a heart attack. All this nonsense being in reunion, in easy humor sets, and then knocking the bell. When they do that, everyone drops what they do face to face in a stern interview, just like a pack of Pavlov dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In this we see the abusive fiancé being dealt with by his longtime victim and around the bad actress. There is an improvised wedding where black people like angels are hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to watch it so far, besides testing your pain threshold, is to hope that her second ass is delivered too. Guess what, this does not happen. Instead, Perry takes the director who faces the testicular challenge and plays it safely, ending the film with a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm sure that if you give me a day, I'm likely to write a PhD on all the ways this film is being absorbed. Do not make me start in the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'll just say this. In my opinion, as a black man, DW. Legacy Griffith live on. The irony is that they do it through a black man who will be worshiped for doing what the birth of a nation did, so we sell down the river. I just hope that Perry films are men so I can kick them in nuts. Thank you so much my friend! What will it follow in 2009, a comedy about beatings and brutal rape of slaves in colonial America?
