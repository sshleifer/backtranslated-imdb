I was expecting a documentary focusing on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I saw a man who hated the fact that his great grandfather had lost his empire from tobacco to the Duke family. This continued. If Mr McElwee's family has overcome the Dukes, I doubt that Mr McElwee will have any problems with the toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McLeod's family started a tobacco business; I was expecting more of McEwee's constant focus on his family. I have learned a little about the history of tobacco in the North Carolina economy and its implications for the state's economy through stricter regulation of tobacco. The countless references to "Leaves Leaves" are invalid - so what if Gary Cooper played the great grandfather of Mr. McElwee? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing the old film clips of a fictional film? I did not.
