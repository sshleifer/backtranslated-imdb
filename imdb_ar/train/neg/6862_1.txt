This extreme lack of "Blind Dead" is another waste in the trash. Many people have designed such films so I can not believe what they are saying about it. Ever since I was a child, I have heard about the greatness of these wonderful films and I have seen them all and I was very disappointed. Have they all been drug users since the 1970s, or do not they know how heavy this crude is?
