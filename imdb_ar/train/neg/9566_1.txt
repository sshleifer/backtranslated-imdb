I see a lot of movies. I experienced the original exercises for years and I loved it. Computers where it is still a "big mystery" for most of us was a convincing film, in its own way. <br /> <br /> This device looks like a low private budget on Wednesday night. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is too weak, you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I do not recommend in the first place). I can not point to one actor who has done a good job in this film. But hey, with this scenario, I'd be surprised if anyone could do a good job. Lots of cliche scenes. CGI seems to have been extracted from the 86 year version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood just write about this. You do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short to miss in watching crazy movies.
