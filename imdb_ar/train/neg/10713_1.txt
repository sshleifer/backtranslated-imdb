Come on, come on. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or Knights Templar, as they are commonly called, did not exist until the early 12th century. The story is so laughable that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren seemed positively bored. In addition, if you want to have a real Templar, why not use the Knights of Christ, who still exist in Portugal. At least they must take history into consideration. The only quality I could find in this film was that the artifacts looked original enough to pass pieces of medieval or Gothic times. The acting was bad, the story was appalling, the traffic terrible, and the props okay.
