Does anyone think that this offer actually helps some people, or does it anger only the people who see it? When I cross the channels, this show is half-viewed by my curiosity. I understand that Pat Robertson is not together. What I do not know is whether his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he says. Pat Roberson is a slim result. He is an old man who thinks in an old way. Fear of a curse no longer has the same effect as before (praise be to God). Now if someone will answer my question I will avoid lightning bolts for the rest of eternity.
