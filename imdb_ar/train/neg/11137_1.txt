All the naked women in the world could not stop me from pressing the stop button about a third of the way through this horrible garbage. With an ironic effect, a similarly crude scenario as well as a weak CGI FX to match; this film is an insult to this type of werewolf. It's supposed to be serious, which would be funny in itself if this movie has reached the level of being a bad joke. Competently but very lazy to make something up a decent quarter. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
