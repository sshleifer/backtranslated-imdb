Just send an email to a friend at the movie school about this. Something to avoid when making a film - characters that draw on the monochrome monologues on screen that are ultimately vulgar and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal bombs go beyond the extent that they actually draw attention to the movie that was created as a film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it acting, or the bad scenario, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also very unreliable for social realism - where the English canonical literature is consumed with bounty and the Bible while being high or hanging and able to produce such deep alveolar soliloquies while drunk? How can an unattractive, unwashed, non-verbal character sleep most of the women he met within minutes of their interview? (I had to clap when one of the chick finally brought him out into the street, despite his pathetic joke). <br /> <br /> The viewer encountered pictorial references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelation. The impending torment of humanity, in the form of striped symbols printed on our foreheads or right hands, is presented in a neurotic way, to an intelligently exposed figure in his role as a guard over the empty space. <br /> <br /> This click has been overstated and on the top - a melodrama soaked with a pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of the human race, life, and so on. It is vulgar, false and misleading. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies available with content similar to this movie. The "Nil by Mouth" trip is an excellent and more interesting journey in the lives of individuals in a similar social environment. As in the "war zone". Although the comparison is not justified, check out anything by Peter Greenway, who deals more subtly with dialogue, attitudes, characters and ridiculous situations.
