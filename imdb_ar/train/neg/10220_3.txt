First of all, this movie can be divided into three sections. A promising opening, with the ambush of some knights by Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long, boring average part, with Candice Bergen and the Blue Soldier traveling together to get to the garrison. Miss Bergen misses four inappropriate words each time she opens her mouth, and seems to have just emerged from Jack Nicholson's film in the 1970s. It means they maintain zero interest, with no credibility. The third and final section involves the totally unjustified slaughter of an Indian village. This is obviously exaggerated to put it on anti-war propaganda, so that it is just a long and outrageous period. Not recommended. - MERK ............................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why not watch the movie you've already attached, instead of hypocrisy on your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, it's for film review. - Merck
