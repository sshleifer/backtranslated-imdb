If you enjoy original SNL shows and offers, you should avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out my friends and waited in line for more than an hour to enter a movie house sold. Halfway through the film the 3/4 theater was empty. We refused to let go of thinking that it would improve. When the film ended we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all theaters and then disappeared. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" refused to comment on this film. The film was an internal joke on SNL episodes released just after the film was released and closed in a single day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike via phone and email to recoup money but were completely ignored.
