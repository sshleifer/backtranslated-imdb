I loved this movie, I'll admit it. This should be the best video movie (direct to?) I've seen. Well ... I and my friend just decided to rent this movie for the footage. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When those red neck against the tree are blasted by Sasquatch, we literally saw this part about three to four times, it was amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Why should the main character roll too much? Like frankly, we know you're in danger, and will not help you much in that. But really, if this movie is in the local video store, rent it. It's worth the money and it will not be as bad, as it is bad, but it is not incredibly bad. Overall, the entire store will be stunning to you if you rent this movie.
