I love the episode where Jim Greenman becomes. It is a nice! When Jim throws this little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts addressing the priest on behalf of his wife just to find out she has become a woman's Paul? Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. I'm trying to find a particular image of that episode. I want to use it as my avatar on the message board because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a Greenman image? Can anyone direct me in the right direction to find such a picture?
