"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of the films of Charlie 1915 Essanay. While this set of films is more watchable than its 1914 counterparts, this film looks slightly below average. The double-vaulted gulp of the narrative and control at the ends of the harsh luck that Charlie woke up from a dream, where he stroked the hair of the lead lady, to cling to the mop head used by the quasi-pad, both of Chaplin's classic moments. Both are ridiculous at first and end. The center is full of fighting with the rival worker's guard and breaking a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the biggest material support for this film, and Charlie uses it to influence an expert comedian, whether he is intent on his character or not. It seems that the mop is changing the ego Charlie who does things he wishes to be able to do, but he will not do with his hands. Interesting things but there is better.
