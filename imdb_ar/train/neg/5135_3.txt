I think the scarecrows are scary, so it's unfortunate that this film does not do more. <br /> <br /> A bunch of thieves carry an emergency umbrella from a plane to a huge field with a scarecrow. One of them disappears with looting and so the rest chases him while he is attacked by vicious calamities that can not be explained. Representation is dislocated and the shocks are ineffective (when moving). On the positive side, the director comes out some thrill of static scandals. As Alfred Hitchcock says: "A bomb under a table explodes, and this is surprising, we know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it will explode.
