This film made me very angry. I was keen to stifle "scientists" and filmmakers while invisible. Very painful too to sit down. Sophomoric and Tinnitus in the worst way. Check out a few good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory in a sea of ​​new horses. The worst offenders were the charlatans of Ramtha and Joseph Desinza. Mr. Debenza tells us that most people live a life of mediocrity and clearly indicate that, on the other hand, he lives on a higher plane. Even the ideas and positions that I basically agree on are presented in such a harsh, arrogant, superior, arrogant and preaching way that I felt a desire to disavow them. I think that is what made me very angry, and the fact that they took what was in fact the deep aspects of the established scientific thought and distorted it with their new age. Most rely on the fallacy of applying quantum theory to the whole world. It is fitting that the dramatic parts with Marley Matlin are amateur and vulgar. <br /> <br /> I would like to refer people instead to the excellent Bill Bryson study of science: "a brief history of almost everything." There are a lot of deep questions about life and the universe in the real science firm.
