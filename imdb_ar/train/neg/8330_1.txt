I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While I was watching, I thought, "This flick is really bad pornography without porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real issues." Then I watched the director / writer Carlson explain his operation as a special feature. Yes, it was a real distinction. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on two alcohol-rich losers who beat each other to escape. They are marginally attractive. There is full frontal nudity. These factors may explain the film being watched at all. <br /> <br /> The most shocking element in the film is gay beatings and the subsequent sexual harassment of the same victim who is trying to take revenge on the attackers in an incompetent way. The losers are drunk. Not only is the subject dealt with absurdly and technically poor, but the representation is very bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is the boxer theme - appendices. This is really crazy, not just absurd. This big boxer is shocked by the constant attention of his fat-haired mother working in the parking lot of the gym. This is in Los Angeles, block you. The boxer suffers from such a shock that he gets up at the annexe's house, stands in front of him and is excited about the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why does a boxer who is in the heart? Viewer be severely shocked by the stalker's attention? It's simply not logical. I am afraid that some psychological dynamics seem logical, if you take the time to read them. However, bad writings rarely make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to think that this film represents a large minority in the gay community. Well, maybe it's true, I suppose. We may never know, since this minority will be so dysfunctional that it is barely able to organize enough to reach a mysterious gay film festival or DVD store, the only two places where this turkey can be found. Thank God for that.
