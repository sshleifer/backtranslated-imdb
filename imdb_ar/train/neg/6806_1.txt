Along with all technical errors. <br /> <br /> What about a flight host capable of killing, all alone, 4 out of 7 terrorists (including former Marines), two of them without even using a gun. Then, the plane landed completely. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we're talking about a regular and scary flight host and a good author. : D What about the commander responsible for the assault / rescue squad, the existence of a complete plan (according to the logic of the script) is to put everyone out of the gases emitted and to direct a person from his team to the plane. Only decides the moment he changes his plans and instead leads an attack on the terrorists, the guns burn, the whereabouts of the terrorists, or how many of them, do not secure a privileged position, so that his entire team is easily erased. Yes, this uses the old noggin. Only later to decide to use the sleeping gas anyway. It turned out to be useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> It's bad because this film was, though, I could not stop myself from watching and wondering, what next? : D I can not help but imagine all the excellent freelance script writers who think for themselves, this is not fair. Haha! :Dr
