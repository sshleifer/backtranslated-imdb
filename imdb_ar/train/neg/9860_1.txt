I usually enjoy movies like this. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are horrifying. The wooden representation is harsh and writing cliches, but not in a good way at all. When I wrote this command, I was surprised that it was 5.2 / 10 on the IMDb. I'm sure most of these sounds should come from relatives of people in the movie. I suppose if that's the case, you can manage some laughter, because it's always funny to see your relatives / friends make a film. Well, somehow, I think this gives hope to all the writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do that, you can do it. However, maybe you should not.
