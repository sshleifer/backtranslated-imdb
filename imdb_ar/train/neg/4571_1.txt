What we know about "Flip" is a deceptive and non-random look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a presentation of the experts (none of whom are named) who are wandering around and being postponed in a completely unscientific way. His interviews are divided into very small segments and scattered through some brilliant and brilliant small plots. <br /> <br /> The film presents themes of science, philosophy, theology and politics, combines them together without any consideration for accuracy, and draws in one way or another some abstract and nonsensical conclusions. We have been told to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficulty in answering the question that filmmakers want to point their fingers at. <br /> <br /> They are logical errors in the case of disappearance. How did we begin quantum mechanics and ended up with this pseudo-spiritual spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two equals four, so I can move objects rationally." <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this film, and almost nothing is accurate. Any discriminatory scenes will be disturbed by intense editing, special intrusive and useless effects, and lack of substance in general. Educated viewers will be frustrated by the violence of science and every subject of this film.
