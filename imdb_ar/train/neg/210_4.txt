You may not have to compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original hip hop. Beat Street has a lot of original hip hop artists, but obviously they made it clear that this might be a great break, of course for some it was beautiful. But if you look at this as an original hip-hop culture, you're wrong. It has been overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Instead of searching for the first two films I mentioned. They conveyed the sadness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating of this film is low, but the comments are mostly positive or even delirious. This may be because although the story, the acting, the dialogue and the direction are all horrifying, music and dance are what people like. I loved dancing, but at the time I thought that electrolyte was the death of hip-hop (I was very happy when it appeared around 1986 with a new generation of classical hip-hop artists now, such as Chris Wen, The Public Enemy, Ultramagentic Mac, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie To name a few) and I still do not like the most beats in this film, which is why it does not work for me. I mean that Wild Style does not contain a lot of stories but the music there is fantastic and real. Of course tastes vary and that's fine. But for me, this is a trash can except for music and some music, so I can not rate it higher than 4 out of ten.
