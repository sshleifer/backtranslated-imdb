I will start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really loved the songs, everything about them was wonderful, fashion, music, songs (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, and everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But that's all. <br /> <br /> Get it, Arte Cinema, blabble, but too much silence (it was fun for an hour, but two hours of hearing and bending steps from time to time, really ...), lots of boredom (I really understand it, I understand that they were filming a pornographic film there, but really, really, that's too many) I really think that cinema has to be seen and this one It is certainly not viewable in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 Stars for songs.
