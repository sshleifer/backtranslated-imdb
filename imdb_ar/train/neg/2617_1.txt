This film was pure pain. While I sat in the theater for x minutes, I was wondering about when the movie would start. All the devices were in place; a typical love story, the characters must overcome their shortcomings, the villain must appear, but none of them began. At the time these things happened, I was really bored and the devices were not quite effective. In scenes that require tremendous tension and great accumulation, I felt that the necessary frames had been cut. Baby things do not have to be that way. Children's movies can be perforated and attractive like adult movies. The excuse, "Hey, for the children," is Thor. I will have "sword in stone" any day. This was terrible. I feel a sense that Disney will put anything these days. As for the kids, the 10 years I've seen this with OK ... pure rubbish.
