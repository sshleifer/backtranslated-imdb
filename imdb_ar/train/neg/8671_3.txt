I watched this movie on March 21 of this year. I must say disappointed. But much better than "Tridev." Plot is exposed to piracy. He tells about Prabhat who lives with his father, wife and younger brother. The movie opens when the bride is saved. Anyway, I'm the smallest kid who commits a plot to kill his little brother. He makes a plan by sending a few men. They come to school pretending to be friends of Brabs. Kill this child. The father expels him from the house. Then later he and Akash went to Kenya to find him. My age has performed well, Chanki was annoying at best, Nasirdon was wasted. I did a good defa, wasted Sonam, and wasted Giutna but looked nice. The child who played Suniz's brother in the film was nice. Very sad because he had to kill his character. The girl was nice but was annoying. The other child did well. Well what was good. Kiran was good. Amrich and Gulshan did well. Excellent cinematography in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good dialogues. It also goes on. the movie. The music was good. You only liked one song, Sat Samondar. The lyrics were good. Other songs were memorable. I do not see it. Rating for 10/03
