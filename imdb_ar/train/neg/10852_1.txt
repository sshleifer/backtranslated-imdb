This movie is very funny film. The violence is bad, acting ... well, Danny, sticking to singing or yelling or whatever hell you normally do. The random chicks that do not wear almost anything are just an attempt to catch gothic frustrated gays. Personally, I think this film really absorbs. The story and the characters can be very good, if it is said that guidance, actors and other small things achieved are better. But the film is bad, and the only reason people like this piece of trash is that it contains Danny. This is probably the worst film ever. Believe me, it's hard to achieve, especially when you compete with Def by Temptation and more than crazy excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, so I see this as another film for rubbish ... a very bad film. If Danny does this as a comedy, it's good to go to him. very good work. Even more so, I rate it low, because it is crazy. You can watch it when you are in a happy, happy and joyful situation so you can laugh at everything or if you are dealing with different types of drugs.
