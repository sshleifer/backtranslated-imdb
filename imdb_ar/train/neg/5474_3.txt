To be fair, they did what they could with a budget of five shillings and six pence, but the dialogue was more cowardly than 9 pounds of emmental and CGI was a little old hat now. Maybe if some of the actors were not completely carved out of granite, it might have made the film a bit better too. Saying it was terrible was making the film a bad service, if you wanted to see something completely it would be better to sit and waste a few hours Of your life and you see the "sickle", which is very scary, it is really good (there are many big alcoholic drinks that are ambiguous.) Anyway, I enjoyed this movie and it was worthwhile if you have not seen it yet, Something similar to "Jurassic Park or the Lost World" or "apocalypto".
