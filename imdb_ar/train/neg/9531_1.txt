This is a terrible film. Two young teenage girls seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give in connection with the plot or the "spoiler". I would just like to comment that the end is the strangest part of the blasphemy. A large part of the film "Locke" and "Camp" includes an abhorrently hugs, while smiling broadly in the camera. Add to this an audio clip that repeats again and again, including Vodvillian's song "Dear Old Dad", referring to an unpopular quality that the viewer never sees. Music is annoying at first, and ends up exposing the viewer to torture worse than the ones on the screen. The idea here is that young people are running their activities, and can be understood as a response to the 1960s, but this is a bit of imagination or style. avoid it!
