This film, which has been shown live on a video, must bear a warning sticker that poses a danger to human health and may expose the viewer to ultimate boredom. It is another religious film "grainy" and muddled with a patchwork, and suddenly disappears with the good guys (the believers) and the wicked (unbelievers) who have left behind them. It is an interesting concept, especially as we see it happening on a journey that is taken by an uninsured person who has an evil relationship with a hostess. (Needless to say, the sinner does not disappear!). Unfortunately, with all the pilots not believing, the plane did not crash or the film was over. Although this can be interesting without heavy religious beatings, the whole film based on the entire film makes one gulf, but the acting is shocking, and the simulations created by the computer seem to be very fake. In addition to another film filmed in Canada allegedly New York City. Save me ... I will read only the Bible.
