This film is a crisp mix of cliches from modern cinema. There are some promising ideas out there, but while it was clear that the director was aiming to finish a painfully vague film, what ended was a confusing mess. Principal actor Daniel Wu is doing a fair job but without any major theme it seems as if he has little to do with him. Moreover, the film is largely free of fear (although in fairness, there are some frightening moments amidst the toil). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of the separated twins, the diabolical librarians, the interests of ghostly love, the confusion of identity, the death of the brutal monkeys, the Oedipus conflict, the abusive wives , Rising homosexuality, and criminal gang connections. The only real common denominator shared by these elements is that they caused the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that although the brother died by monkeys that appeared strongly on the DVD cover, the act itself was not filmed directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what seems to be shots of monkeys - not too scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an excellent and mysterious psychological horror story, see the Korean film "The Story of Two Sisters" (2003).
