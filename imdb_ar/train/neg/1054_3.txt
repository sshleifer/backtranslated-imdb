The rural family drama - with reference to "ordinary people" - concerns a small boy who withdraws after his older brother is wounded in a shooting incident. Despite the optimistic topic (due to Christopher Caen's merciless treatment by director Christopher Kane), there are some dynamics in this sad story that deserve exploration. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural climate and the reluctance of adult figures to take responsibility for the situation make the film a disgusting experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Primley in the film, is almost a small-sized reunion of "natural." Too bad This project did not get the talent behind the camera to get a stunning picture unforgettable. * 1/2 of ****
