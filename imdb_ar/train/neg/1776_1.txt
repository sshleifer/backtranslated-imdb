This film has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever produced. It is true that most films based on King's work are very bad, but this film goes well beyond the realm of horror. There is not one scary moment in it unless you think of scary stupidity. It is the typical king rubbish - the twisted myths about it are meaningless in the first place, mixed with so-called "obvious" and shocking "concerns" like the Playboy Theater (which, at least, amusing). It is full of ridiculous moments, not least the character of Alice Craig. When you get out of the frenzy and begin to ridicule like the villain in an old TV show from Batman, it's absurd to be sick. All the people who got a veil in this (including John Landis) are lucky because they are still holding jobs. But the most ridiculous part must be a cat fashion near the end, which looks like cheap rubber clothes someone bought at K-Mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of some real cats that actually excel in the film.
