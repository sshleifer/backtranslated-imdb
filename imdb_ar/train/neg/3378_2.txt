By the time this movie was released, I had watched Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and I was eagerly anticipating the production of a film telling a long story. My wife and I queued up hours before the box office opened the day the movie was shown. It was not just a disappointment, I had a kick in the belly. <br /> <br /> First, the "story has been moved", so to speak, by including scenes that do not fall within the boundaries of the theater. These boundaries are a large part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (select your own request): One of the original songs was removed, with a very dynamic dance number; a song was added that was not in production. say what ?? I am confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason to give this movie two stars instead of 1 is to admire the talent and hard work of the artists. I have now seen the Chorus line on the stage 6 times, and I do not mind seeing it 6 times more before I die. It is beautifully written, with great music and real painful stories. If you want to see a music that includes a great test of "Cattle Invitation", I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, see it on stage.
