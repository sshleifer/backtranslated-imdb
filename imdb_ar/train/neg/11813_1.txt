Before Stan Laurel became the youngest half of the greatest comedy team ever, he worked under a contract with Bronco Billy Anderson in a series of wealthy people, many of which were a parody of Hollywood's main features. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal parody series at Joe Rock (and the most needy) of the production company. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's films were a funny parody at the time, and even less funny to modern audiences who have not seen the original movie of the satirical Laurel. "West of the Hot Dog" is a fairly general parody of cowboy shoot-ups. It is a peripheral parody of the "West of the Bekos", a casserole released two years ago without major actors. Because 'West of the Pecos' was not a big success at all, it's hard to see why Stan's film unit chose this particular film as a target for their missions, let alone why they waited a long time after being ridiculed. And where did they get the title "West of the Hot Dog"? Maybe it comes back to the fact that "Hot Dog"! Sexual opposition was favored by American astronomers in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the theatrical theater "Machinal"). <br /> <br /> West of Hot Dog was produced and co-authored by Joe Rock. Among his many other accomplishments, Rock Laurel gave to Lewis Nelson, and was then the best man at their wedding. Full Disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the great honor of having Joe Rock certified and interviewed. It was almost a 90-year-old rock memory that was impressively clear ... but he never remembered anything about the West of the Hot Dog, and I can not blame him. This film is largely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The character of the lead lady is Little Mustard: If this means a parody of something in West of the Pecos, I do not get it. There are some "impossible" gags here, including the Laurel way of mounting a horse. For just one moment in this film, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Keaton Buster when he suddenly broke into jogging. "West of Hot Dog" is vaguely similar to the theme and tone of the short film Keaton "The Frozen North", but Keaton's version is more entertaining. The plot of this film is somewhat predictable in Keaton's film 'Our Hospitality', but (again) suffers from the comparison: here, two Casian brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon salon, but the former owner has inherited it for Stan Stan's weakness. However, the brothers will become legitimate heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, though: Is this a legal will? Once Stan acquires the property, will certainly become any other questions relating to property or inheritance decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had plenty of time to look at such legal points while watching this boring comedy. <br /> <br /> At some point, the muzzle contains some raw animations that are drawn directly on the movie stock. Looks cheap and not funny. <br /> <br /> This Hot Dog is neither strange nor winning: it is just a microscope. My rating: one point out 10. Wait Stan: Over a few more years, you will be half of the comedy legend.
