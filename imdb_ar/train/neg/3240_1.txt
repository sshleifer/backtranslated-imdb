This is the first film "Guinea Pig" from Japan and this is the most satisfactory, in my opinion. A group of men tortured a girl for several days before finally killing her. At this point, I will say that these films are not real! These are horror films that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are sick but unrealistic in many cases. For example, when the girl is kicking in the ground, we can clearly see how they kick and grind the ground near the girl! And how stupid this looks! Sound effects are also unrealistic and meaningless. Other scenes include the intestines of the animals thrown at the girl, the girl who was subjected to loud noise for several hours, the tearing of her nails, the worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and distorted with shocking details and things like that. A very sick and impulsive movie means nothing at all or has cinematic significance. This first entry is "Guinea Pig" the most satisfactory and most amateurish, although it is not bloody like the next part, "Flowers of flesh and blood", which tries to be as awful as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's The experience is probably the most I've seen and the closest thing to snuff. This is still (of course) false, and the only difference in the real "snuff movie" is that no one dies or hurts the truth in this film. I can not recommend this to anyone because this is **** y and disgusting. Those who consider this a great horror film do not understand anything about cinema and its true meaning. I saw this as curiosity (like the other parts of the chain) and now I know how important this garbage is. They only work at shock level and this is not a very valuable cinematic achievement. Maybe Devils' experience is the most I've ever seen, and maybe the Mermaid in the Slot (Guinea Pig 4) is the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. These are very extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
