There was a lot of love that was put in the film "Fantastic Mr Fox" by "Wes Anderson", unfortunately, all the love is for himself. Granted, there was a lot of time and effort to make this universe ever eccentric, but if the same time and effort were put into the script to try to make it funny. The worrisome thing is that I think it was, and that's the best that Wis Anderson can find. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, but when the camera is further away, everything becomes really harsh on the eyes, and to be completely honest is a bit like a mess. There was nothing special about acting either, as Wes chose to choose his friends and big names on more specialized vocal actors that might have made the film better. I am quite sure that George Clooney's vocal representation consists of two appearances in South Park, one of which is a dog. <br /> <br /> The movie is very cocky and tries to be very clever and different, and usually, despite the movie being shown in England, all the good animals are ordinary Americans playing baseball, while the bad guys are typical English with The most insulting English dialects. I can not confirm how much time this movie waste. I did not laugh once.
