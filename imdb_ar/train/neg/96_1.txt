Oh wait, I can! This movie is not intended for a typical movie, unless you want to define typical movie definitions, such as "edit continuity" and "geographic matching." I could not figure out where you were in this movie. One second at the moment, the next moment they are supposed to drive a modern SUV in the 1970s wearing what seems to me like a 1980s dress. Think. I could not pay enough attention long ago because the acting was terrible. I think they got attention just because they contain three-dimensional I have not seen. If you are a fan of B movie, I mean b-movie BAD movie, this movie is suitable for you. It's a home movie and all the unreasonable elegance keeps you laughing as long as you can stay awake. If your taste is more for Goddard and Anthony, just skip it.
