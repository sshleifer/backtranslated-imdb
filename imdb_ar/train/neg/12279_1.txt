Although this seems quite old (2002), I only saw my first episode at all last night and I must say it must be the worst show. . . Absolutely. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one to put comments, but I was so shocked that there is an offer that can blatantly try to turn to him, and I just assume that this is their target audience, children under the age of 12. Older people or people with a lower than average IQ. <br /> <br /> The episode that took place last night contained many lines of disjointed stories. I tried to include in every summary a possible plot imaginable, while trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The main story they covered in the episode: Furath House has made a mistake with a lot of alcohol - death turns into being a senator who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually killed by peanut allergy. The senator thinks he could be his arch-foe and the best friend of childhood. He did it because the senator was taking money for voting for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said "no" to mean the millionaire millionaire. The student was disgruntled who had been reported by the victim already had the experience of changing life, did not pay the enemy of the Senate desperate student to kill the son of his enemies sworn, giving money Freely to many of the smashed students). While the heroine of this dodgy has her niece who is "at that age" and has a crush on a boy, who eventually gets the courage to talk to him with the help of her aunt, but only to give him girls say "it" is not good enough, Overcome them. Do not worry, she returns with the boy after she realizes the reality of life and puts the girls "in", and Annette also explains that God is the only one she can count on (I was almost ill at this point). <br /> <br /> This "drama" gets better when Sue and her FBI team discover who the killer is. . . You gonna laugh at this, I definitely did. . . <br /> <br /> He is one of the children of Furat who discovered that he was adopted just one year ago and that his real father is an international terrorist and that he is trying to provoke a real father by killing a boy and planting a bomb at a funeral. . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard and the representation is cardboard and the continuity is cardboard and the story is cardboard Anyone who says they love this exhibit has cardboard for the brain <br /> <br /> Why this The authors tried to show that packing in all the possibilities in one view means that they clearly do not trust the personal development or the ability of the actors to implement a simple landline. Watching this show is like watching "Last Action Hero" with Arnie killed for five thousand people with a choice of teeth, except Arnie is a better actor (wow, he did not think there would be a day I would say that !!) <br /> <br /> <br /> In the words of the beloved Simpson family "comic book". . . . <br /> <br /> The worst TV show. . . . . Start.
