I feel as if I have passed, deception continues, do not fall on it. After reading the incandescent comments (the filmmaker was a film critic with Sky for years, so he must have plenty of fellow journalists willing to do a disservice by writing positive reviews) I was expecting strong acting, atmosphere, suspense and strong characterization and intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol," does not fulfill the promises that critics have promised, for the most part, to sacrifice these qualities instead of the low-budget special effects of cheese (what was this unknown scene in the spiderweb there?), The unrealistic choreography. Meaningless mental narratives, vulgar alterations and camera angles. <br /> <br /> "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" begins with some interesting, beautiful shots in Scotland, but it is directly down here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time building the atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building a comment - the manager chooses to start driving you crazy through a loud voice. The main characters are not very sympathetic and act very badly - the public does not care what happens to them, the desperate actors do desperate things ... such a movie! To make matters worse, a "greeting" (typical of the director trying to pay his dues to the past masters) is either cliches altogether or unconvincing. Soundtrack was the only thing that kept me up and kept me in the cinema, but even that failed to support the other dramatic story that is tied to a period of work. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film has become increasingly flawed and to be very honest and annoying. I'm still watching all damn thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked to try the terrible realism in the film, but it was destroyed when it often intersected with strange, abstract, and sometimes meaningless scenes. You do not need a huge budget to produce a really moving film. Much has been said about how little money they have to produce this movie, half a million dollars is not a bit of money ... so there are no reasons! Sometimes I wonder what the actors are thinking ... or their clients were thinking! <br /> <br /> Pass this turkey unless it is mascia or reckless anyway .... there is nothing for me <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
