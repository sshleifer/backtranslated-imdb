I am allowed to write 1000 words about this film, but one word can suffice: strange. My wife and I did not laugh at this really horrible film. We kept looking at each other with our best effort "What ...?" Expressions. There is no way to describe this film adequately. Tomato killer was funny, but this is sick. What kind of mind produces such images and puts them in a film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this strange and strange film, then packs it as if it were suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, do not let him watch this movie. You can see it before it appears - maybe with "What ...?" Expressions on their faces. If you decide to attach this movie to others, you may want to increase the egg pressure. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst film ever made.
