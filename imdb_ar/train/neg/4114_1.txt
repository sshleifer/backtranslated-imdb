There are some great philosophical questions. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? And why do they make this villain ??? The premise is ridiculous. Acting acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overpriced. The film is the endless gun battle between some of Hollywood's wildest shots of all time. But then, if the footage were good, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there would be no film. Too bad that did not happen this way. You fill it off several times, you stuck to it to see how bad it was. Happy to I (SPOILER?) The last line is the stupidity of the coronation of a full narcotic scenario, it is not worth even putting the second feature in the third rate in the off season. Apart from the general horror of the film, I am deeply concerned about its impact on young audiences. The Americans hated such folly and then wondered why events like Columbine occurred. This is really ordinary cinema on the Brobdingnagian scale!
