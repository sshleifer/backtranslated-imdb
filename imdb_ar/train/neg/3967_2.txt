DARK REMAINS is a low-budget American horror film that somehow wins two awards. <br /> <br /> The plot appears to have two separate lines. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting off her wrists while bathing. Second, the daughter of a young writer was found with her throat. The sad couple decide to move into an isolated cabin in the mountains. It turns out that the cabin and the surrounding sites are inhabited. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, two separate cases eventually converge as one would expect. However, execution is arbitrary and may result in confusion that may be resolved only through multiple observations. Unfortunately, the film simply does not tempt enough to attract most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Everything can happen wrong with this movie error happens - and quickly! The low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production because the material was simply too bad. <br /> <br /> Characters are not useful as other reviewers have pointed to this site. The badly written text presents a large number of people without giving them an interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for personalities-driven attitudes without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The trend is not inspiring. The inspiration from J-Horror movies like RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is clear. Unfortunately, DARK REMAINS managers did not pay close attention to J-Horror. J-Horror works effectively because it plays on the fear of the unknown. Tension is created by continuous shifts between the strange position (ghost on the CCTV camera walking towards it for example), and a central personality reaction is confronted without warning. There is no humor or tongue element in the cheek in these films. Everything is played straight and without any regrets or restrictions you can only convince and capture. The vibrant atmosphere creates suspense and ensures that the horror has a psychological impact, unlike the "jump fears" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> DARK REMAINS directors made a bold attempt to avoid clich√©s in Hollywood and also successfully avoided using CGI. J-Horror can be well-intentioned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed "concerns" on the screen. The "ghost" make-up effects were not very bad because of the low budget, but their behavior was only challenging logic. I scratched my head several times during this film. <br /> <br /> I could not give up the end even if I wanted to. I simply can not understand it. All I could deduce was that it was a kind of counter-peak. <br /> <br /> What's left? The answer as references on a different website pointed out that it boredom. The film is a routine to sit down. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, it is likely to be turned off before long. <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things that I can find in this movie - the success in avoiding terrifying cliches and the absence of the word "f-word" in every single phrase like the one you normally expect to find. This is what the two stars aim at. <br /> <br /> People who like supernatural or psychological horror about ghosts and chases may like to stick to movies like The LEGEND of HELL HOUSE, The CHANGELING or J-Sub-genre of horror movies. <br /> <br /> If you think you've watched a lot of static movies and want to watch a very low-cost, mysterious horror film about the R budget for ghosts, see DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror film ever created, but it's definitely better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> I would advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like Plague.
