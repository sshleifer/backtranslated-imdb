I tend to admire character-based films. I also think that Hope Davis is turning into good work constantly, so I had high hopes in this film. These hopes quickly dissipated. <br /> <br /> The main drawback in this film is the direction. There are lots of scenes that are the sequence of daydreaming. The film frequently benefits from the character of Dennis Leary as the changing ego of Campbell's character Scott. It does not work for me at all. This would have played a better role than the film. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in the film take a journey and end up in a different place from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experiments that were filmed in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the modification has not been done well. There was a big dip in the middle of the film which was exceptionally boring. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the movie, which I felt was constantly strong, this film failed in almost all aspects of cinema.
