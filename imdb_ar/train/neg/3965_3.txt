I think I agree that a lot of comments here should be fake. Even if the film is not necessarily bad, it is definitely below average. "Dark Dark Remains" is a ghost film mainly for the idea of ​​your ghosts and the bad emotions that haunt you. The film actually begins with two unrelated stories that are not connected together. A couple loses a child who is found in his bed. They move to a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is haunted, somewhat. From here on Dark Remains start very slowly with some really horrible moments (the first manifestations of the nice ghosts and the light bulb sequence are also very good). Well, then ... A woman sees the ghost of her daughter, and other ghosts of people die in accidents or suicides have appeared, the man tries to solve the mystery of previous homes, women get depressed, and show strange neighbors. Everything there was pretty much, but the premise of being their own nice emotions, so wait for the evolution. There is no evolution, you are confused by the story of the history of a haunted house, the stranger neighbor, a creepy prison completely meaningless and his dead daughter thrown with the idea of ​​photography reminds me of a lot of "shutter". The end is ridiculous because when you start and finish a slow piano with piano, its beautiful lame ones contain some ghostly treasures at one time that look like a zombie flick, of course only to return to the slow rhythm and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... it could have been a game Dark Remains a scary scary ghost story if the script is not trying to go anywhere and get anywhere. The feeling and contradiction in the basic atmosphere of the film. Besides ... Please do not use abandoned prisons again. Its so worn out and in this case it does not make sense at all. "Hey, this creepy prison is arduous, lets shoot there." I think a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains have been put into the mix.
