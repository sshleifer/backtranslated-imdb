Do not waste your time in this movie. It could have been good, but the finish was one of the most argan I've ever seen. I have to seriously wonder how people involved in making this film could look at this final scene and think, "Yes! Now there is an end!" They fought back on the subject. To me it seemed like they ran out of ideas! They built the final scenes to get a cool touch, but instead, just let the whole installation fall to his face. When the last shot faded to black and I heard that credit music began to shock - I could not believe what I was watching, and that even someone could call this the end. The best anyone can do with this movie is to rewrite the end and give it some content. Seriously, I would really like to get someone who came to this person in the room, look him in the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
