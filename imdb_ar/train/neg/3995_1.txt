'1408' is the latest version of the tactics of cheap intimidation. The kind that may make horror fans stylized by history films sometimes jump up in their seats and yell at your ear, but they disappoint the public in seeking a little depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays a role for a writer who has made his career writing books that describe his experiences in staying in inhabited hotels. Despite the assertions of the shepherds and the owners that the ghosts roam the halls, there is nothing to make him a true believer in her paranormal. When you know the history of Room 1408 at Overlook Hotel - do not wait, I mean, the Dolphin Hotel in New York City - it decides to make the perfect closing chapter of his last book. However, Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the role of owner of the hotel, is trying to force his guest to recount the atrocities that took place in the theater room since the opening of the hotel several years ago. The story is simple and, as potential skeptics, we must sit in Jackson's long, long sands. <br /> <br /> In other words: Be scared! Be very scared! <br /> <br /> Of course, it will be easy to convince the public that they have just paid to see a thriller on the top of the seat if it does not take long to accumulate to this point. Also, if what follows is more than a cheap "mockery" it has become so repetitive and arbitrary that you might eventually expect it soon. The room temperature changes automatically. Drip walls in blood. The brave writer can not open the door, etc. After nearly an hour and a half of delivering to the masses that promised great excitement, she might sit and hope to be dazzled at least by the end. With doubts about the sequence of dreams and other time derivatives, so that it failed to soothe our doubts that before the movie ended, we might finally have something to make the film a little less than completely oblivious. <br /> <br /> Despite the great performances (as always) of Cusak, which is essentially the entire film, most other important people are lost (ie, Samuel L. Jackson) in minor minor roles. The real mystery here is how the film received a high degree of viewer. Ghosts filling the ballot?
