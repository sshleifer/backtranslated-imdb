I usually do not write reviews, but I can not understand why this is rated too high and I wanted a warning for horror lovers, as I can only assume that all these high ratings have been awarded by ordinary TV monitors. <br /> I just watched the first two episodes but these two were cliches, it was not even more funny. The same old stories you may have seen / read several times already - live games, evil things of other dimensions ... Not only are these stories not innovative, they are also very bad copies of those cliches. Better for example "Chucky" and "Silent Hill" on these two cases at any time. Do not even ask about the visual effects ... those in the first episode are fine but those in the second episode ... are awful. Sounds like a film student project went wrong. Blood ... or Gore ... ERM ... Nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting that a 10-year-old boy may not have seen / read so many scary stories yet (though better to recommend "beyond imagination" - now this is what I call a television show Fuzzy decent). But for adult horror fans this is worthless. We were given only three points because there are actually some beautiful movies (especially in the second episode) and some beautiful acting.
