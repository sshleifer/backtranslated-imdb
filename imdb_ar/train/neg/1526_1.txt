I may have seen worse movies than this, but if I do, I do not remember. Or perhaps prevented them. Who knows, if you have been hypnotized, I may remember them, perhaps, as well as those abducted by foreigners during their childhood or other trauma. If so, I will happily replace those memories with those I have when watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I must give the film some recognition: it has produced an emotional response. I actually began to get angry at the scenes that spoiled the movies and other television shows, and that this farce was tarnished in conjunction. I am terrified that I may be unable to watch films like Dr. Strangelov again without turning this film into my eyes.
