I tried to sit through this bomb not long ago. It was a disaster. The acting was awful. There were some pathetic scenes of movement that fell in the shape of a lead balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of representatives only did not seem to be true. It is supposed to be a recent rework of Hifcock's original "Lifeboat". I think Hictcock was circling in circles in his grave when thinking about it. The film movie.it boasts a few quasi-big names, but they make no effort in their characters. But, as you know, to be fair, it was not really wrong. I mean, I'm sure the script has exploded in the first explosion. This may end up improving as he progresses, but for me, I'm not ready to spend at least three days to find out. So unless you have a weekend for at least three days, avoid it so stinky / 1/10
