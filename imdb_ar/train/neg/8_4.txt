6/10 representation, not wonderful, but good disposition. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Out, take some stupid decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story is absolutely meaningless and contains a large amount of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The overall result of this film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie, it is not worth it. I was given 4 for this film and maybe it was too much. Characters are overly exaggerated in real life and some things that can not be explained to some extent happen "in an unrealistic way" and not in a good way. Due to the style portrayed in this movie, you are bored after 30 minutes (lots of special effects: slow movements, camera jerks and rapid progress). It's always good to use a music movie to make the story smoother, but there are many tracks in that track. At the first hour, there are approximately 50/50 dialog boxes and music
