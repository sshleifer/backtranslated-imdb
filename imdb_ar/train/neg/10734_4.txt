I have not yet read a professional negative review of this film. I think I should have missed something. The starters are interesting, where the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain some of them with some invented stories. This is the best part. After three separate ways, the film is divided into three threads. This is the time when boredom begins. Sure, the thread with the Felliniesque Babushka who makes dolls from chewed bread is initially an open curiosity for the eye. Unfortunately, the director has won on this to death, even by injecting the land line plot does not lead to any particular place. Bottom line: lack of resourcefulness for two hours. If you have insomnia, look in bed and enjoy a good night's sleep.
