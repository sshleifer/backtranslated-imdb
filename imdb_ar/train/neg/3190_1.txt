Jimmy Dean could not have been more disturbing or verbal. Hysterical if we look at it through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I appreciate ten years. I mean, you should be seeing this obesity pig that feeds on corn around Malta enough to send you to vomit, if you do it away in the movie. This hysterical farce should be put together with the likes of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". A film like this proves that actors, writers, producers, etc. are late in their mortgages, or stoned to the point of madness. The question "Who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then good judgment prevailed and there was no "final justice" at all. We would not get a loud parody at Mystery Science Theater 3000!
