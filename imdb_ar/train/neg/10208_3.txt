There is something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder By Numers" because somewhere inside Hollywood version is a good movie trying to appear. However, by the time the credits roll, there is no save it. The whole thing is the "police side" of the story, where detective figures are confused about the murder of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin through a critical sexual relationship that becomes more important as the film goes on. Although Bullock is strong in its role, it is not enough to keep the text faded and slow speed. Ben Chaplin's talents are lost in a role that can be forgotten (I've had a much better year earlier in the "Christmas Girl" that has been underestimated) as well as Chris Ben, who plays a small role without a doubt and feels sorry for your talent like him. In any case, the plot really is not even a factor in this film at all. Ryan Jocling and Michael Pitt are the only real killers to watch this film. Their talent and chemistry work very well and they play away from each other very well. It's very bad that they were not in a much better film. Barbet Schroeder takes a very safe step here for a seasoned film director. Bottom line: It is worth the rent if you are a kind fan, but everyone will live a full life without seeing it, except perhaps on a TV screen with convenient business breaks.
