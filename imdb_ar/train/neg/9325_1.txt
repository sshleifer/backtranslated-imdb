Illness. Really stands for Crappy Incredibly I kill myself. There was nothing to talk about. The best part of the whole production is artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this film was sufficient. The sub-street photography was sesame. Production resembles underground film production to get views. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The end was predictable, so you have to move quickly up to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it's the best. I would avoid this at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes they made in the entire film worth it. I'm just kidding.
