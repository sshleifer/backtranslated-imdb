I love British humor and I think it is one of the best in the world. I love almost all the British comedies (well ... maybe not my Python, some jokes were great, but some did not understand it), but the Gentlemen Guild is just a good thing to make you sick. This offer was good in some way; it helped me lose some weight because watching this piece of trash makes me feel like I'm not hungry anymore. This is really just a disgusting, sick, not even funny TV show, and I wonder who actually laughs at these things. I watched him for 10 minutes and turned him off. It was disgusting, watching men wear a woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what's funny about that ??? This makes me want to vomit. No teaser, just disturbing and cheap pictures, laughing toilet ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go ahead ... see it ... but honestly, watching people and enjoying it should be some emotional problems. rubbish.
