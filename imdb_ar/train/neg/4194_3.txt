This film began very promising with a story about a director who lost his sight and a blind woman bound to help him. However, somewhere in the middle, the script writers did not seem to know where to go. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable event occurred one after the next event (Russia must be very small because they all collide with each other all the time), the motive behind the leading woman's understandable personality (why do you still follow him after her departure from the ship? Trying to borrow a cell phone on the ship to contact someone?), The side-stories were absolutely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and her boyfriend supposed to be funny?) And what is the story with the younger sister? With all this apparent arbitrariness in the plot, the film managed to be fully anticipated. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the pictures and the result were very beautiful and the representatives of the main characters were also very good. So it could have been a really good film ... but it was not.
