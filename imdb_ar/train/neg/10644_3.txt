Well, here we have another reflection film. There was much to see, despite the tiring plot of gender reflection. However, this is not the case. In previous reviews, I think I have made my point of view about the general decline in the enjoyment of the Haim films that followed the late 1980s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> "Only one of the girls" revolves around a high school kid who tries to avoid being intimidated by wearing his clothes as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading band and endorses his cheerful colleague, Mary (Nicole Egert). It is clear that he can not sustain representation for too long. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was completely nonsense, and it was not funny. But according to the majority of reviewers, Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert appear to be the only ones who want to watch it. If you're looking for a good Haim feature (or comedy switch roles), look no further than 1989. This is the point that revolves around Haim's career.
