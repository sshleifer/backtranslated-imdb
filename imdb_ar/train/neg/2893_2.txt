What was this supposed to be? New edition of King Fisher? Why do we care about Sandler? What a slow, bleak, dull film, who gives a damn about these people !!! I stopped him before it was over. Obviously, Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler needs; as I said: Can you say "Fisher King"? How does this psychic character work in his daily life? We are not supposed to think about it in depth. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to provoke violence? If they are good friends, how are they separated? If Cheadle is under control, then why seek out shrinking advice on the street? He never told us. That's why Fisher King has a better film on many levels and why it absorbs this image. Approximately 8 out of 10 average grade? I absolutely do not agree. Even the top films are lucky to get a high average rating, and these nonsense do not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
