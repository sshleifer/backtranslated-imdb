If you go to watch this movie, it will be a grudge against the movie theater, director, producer, actors and the person who told you to watch it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, to put your name and face on this bad excuse for a movie. It would be more frightening if the Japanese actors had just spoken in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to bet when the movie ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on TV and movie trailers that promote this money maker. Sarah Michelle never had to act at all to produce this film ... She practiced her troublesome skills. Do not waste your time or money in this movie.
