This movie is awesome. She did not laugh hard in the film was unintentionally funny for a long time. Leno must be stuck to stand up and TV late at night. The cars in the film were wonderful, but the film itself is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It is pathetic, horrible representation, the plot was written by 4 years old. Do not get me, Jay Leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
