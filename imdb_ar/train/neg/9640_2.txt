I was always curious about this film because it was hard to find, so when I stumbled on Ebay, I skipped ten dollars and bought it, and now I understand why it's so rare! This film is very bad, as it is terribly written and budget is hopelessly low, so that the final end points, which show all the broken scenes where the lines are fluttered, are the highlights of the film. The film revolves around a psychic (Pettigon, filmed for one obvious reason, her nude scene) that uses her power with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension to this reality. When you pull in a box what looks like things, the army throws it carelessly at the back of the truck with one soldier to guard it, and knows what you know? Surprise! A child wearing a rubbery, rubbery uniform pops up, instantly slaps the soldier with a scratch on his face, and then flees to a nearby town. But instead of deploying half of the province's armed forces to find them and protect public officials, let only Pettyjohn and Ray find them on their own, but regardless, the film has long been a source of credibility. Barely survive the vote with one voice from me just because of unintended laughter, someone needs to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know it! 2 of 10, really, really bad!
