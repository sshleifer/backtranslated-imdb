In 1972, after his wife left to go her own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, the beautiful, long-haired beauty queen, was designed to fill the void in Elvis's life. When the Elvis divorce became final, Linda was already in her place as an intimate friend of the legendary artist and traveling companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a close look at their love affair with Linda, who wholeheartedly attends to the needs and wishes of her lover. And even taking the drugs swallowed by a handful and definition of the relationship of her own love with Valium. Sometimes this film is harsh and dark. A very attractive look at the "King" and Queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is as terrifying as Elvis. Most of the representation to the hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks Linda, but she does well. Support team includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Linz. Watching this twice more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans I've met, this is not a favor.
