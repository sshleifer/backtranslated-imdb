The case is the best part of the film but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I was expecting the film "Based on the real story" only to find a snapshot on a home video containing bad footage associated with scenes of pathetic representation unrelated to slaughter slaughter. The video viewers had many rewind positions that were probably used to extend the length of the feature rather than the effects. I started this review before I was in the middle of the film and I waited until it was all over, but it was low, and it was getting worse. If you could score it any less, the result would be negative. Learn from my fault and save your money and time with this one.
