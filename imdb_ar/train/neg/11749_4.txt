Phil the Alien is one of those alien films based on humor about the strangeness of everything rather than the actual punchlines. <br /> <br /> At first, the film was very funny and funny, but as the film progressed, I could not find the jokes or the weirdness anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget film (that's not a problem in itself), there were some interesting characters, but in the end I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this film will appeal to a thin person participating at the moment. <br /> <br /> For something similar but better to try "Brother from another planet"
