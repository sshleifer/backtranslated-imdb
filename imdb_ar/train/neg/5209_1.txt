Well, I was bored and watched all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is mild, rude and rude. The story is full of naivet√© and rotting your teeth on opening titles. The tail of two "shocked" children learn about "God" the way the fairy tale that left me frankly shocked. He uses Irish 'blarney' in this typical way that one hopes the Irish will never see at all. Aimed at children who frankly will close after the first try in the tone "OIRISH". All in all why pump these out.
