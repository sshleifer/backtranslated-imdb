This is the last time I rented a video without logging in IMDB reviews. The Limey directed Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote a really awful night watch with Iwan McGregor and took out the trash like Out of Sight with actress Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a shame to take part in such a bad film. There is a confusing confusing release that seems to have been a last-minute decision to make up for the shortcoming or the story, the imaging and the sound mind. This movie does everything wrong. As they were thinking?
