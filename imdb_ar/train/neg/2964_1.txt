He laughed a lot - because it's so bad - sorry people, but definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen ... I know it's low budget, but anyway: actors act like soap, the dialogues were very strange this time I have seen such exotic images in trash trash at a video festival for young people ten years ago. I really appreciate meeting people together and making cheap films, but at least a certain amount of quality must be achieved. But there was at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film were fun and enjoyable and looked fine - and the result was worth listening to. The DVD cover promised a lot, but that's the best of this movie ...
