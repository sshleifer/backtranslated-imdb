Bobby is a clumsy child who smiles a lot and wants to have sex. So he buys a small car to help in this endeavor. Lame acting, pathetic comedy and scenario is nothing more than a loose string of cliches and cheap thrills. It is clear that filmmakers wanted to capture some of the craziness of other films at that time, but they failed to achieve much. They even resort to Bobby sliding on the banana skin, because it is supposed to add a comedic value. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to find the movie recovery feature. If you like DeVito, this is another kind of classic role for DeVito - but it's only actor actor and there are valuable cliches.
