You can say "every shock, no plot?" There were a lot of unexplored trends in this film. There was no room history other than deaths. * Why * was evil? What made it that way? Why Countdown Clock? Then, there were unexplored things to hint. For example we saw * a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. But when he stepped up vent said, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all ghosts look "digital", and things "fade" before they hit the ground and make a constant noise? Hmmm ... When you put all these things together, they make Room 1408 look like a high tech luxury house. However, there was no follow-up. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for TV ... The cell phone does not have a signal, but the wireless internet works fine. How many smooth cases can you add? I'm sorry, but this film was only a "shock after a shock." I've done it all before. Reflections in the mirror. Things off site. Changing paintings. Bleeding Walls. "Oh, it was all just a dream ... no it was not." If the room is "evil", why make our main character reconcile with the death of his daughter, if he will keep him trapped there forever? It was not logical. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no basic information about the "first book" he wrote. Just some vague information about "my father was a jerk" and so forth. Talk about parents, what was with the thing about his father? "It will be in my place." <br /> <br /> In general, a really wonderful movie. It has been a 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no background story, personal development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the entire film is made on "cheap"; largely using one set and two site shots, it was only a film effects of recycled, cheesy effects, "seen before."
