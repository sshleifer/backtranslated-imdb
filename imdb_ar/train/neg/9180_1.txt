Well, let me start by saying that nothing in this would surprise anyone who reads other comments. I've been told this, O G-D, I've checked this movie! I mean, WOW, I knew it was possible to throw as much money as they could into something and still get out of any Roger Korman movie! Maybe Korman had shown this movie at some point but was rejected because of poor script quality! The only reason why this movie has been made in the first place is that someone said, "Hey, zombies are popular." Video games are popular.What game can we get that contains a zombie where? Vampire? No, someone else has arrived. There is first a silent hill, no, very silent, people will never sit in a dark room just for fear ... Hey, Sega did not have a game where people ran around zombie shooting? They're out of scope and we can get this for pennies! <br /> <br /> Basically, they tried to do their best to create a movie that looked like a video game, even if the fighting was portrayed as if it were you N The characters are actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and most important problem is that the original game was terrible ... I mean, <br /> <br /> The game of selling bad movies made in the worst game in two weeks After that they were sold and bought normally and the parents for Christmas are horrendous.The graphics were boring.The monsters were boring.The levels were boring.The facade was boring.The issue was boring.In other words, this was a boring game.This was the arcade version. It was the worst! With Home Edition, you did not even get a spray gun in your hand while you're bored silly of this useless game! But I digress. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they went too far to cut scenes from actual play during the fighting scenes. HUH ??? Did not the editor have sufficient confidence in the effects to indicate a real fight? Not to mention that each battle has been filmed from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the boring use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a shooting game from the perspective of the first person (the player returns from a POV character). Maybe that's why they put the graphics of the game, to let you know they were hinting at the game ... True, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that made the experience of ENTIRE enjoyable remotely was the fact that everyone In the theater he ridiculed the film out loud, so Nubati of hysterical laughter and public failure was considered commonplace and unpretentious. <br /> <br /> Even so, do not go to see this movie! It does not even cost to hire him when the video comes out in two weeks. Running. Just run.
