At the end of the world, which lacks the strangeness, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be worried about it in the film Grade-Z, which is not like Sheridan Le Fano's short short story about my mother Lasagne. Recipe. The bored are still running the gas stations and doctors are still making home calls and the police officers who help them are still showing coolant fluids only when needed. The plot, I use the term loosely, involves a father and daughter trying to meet the "general", who lost his daughter, in a church to kill a vampire who, in a very comfortable state, travels with the father and daughter. I must admit that a moment or two of real humor can be found between vast stretches of unintended humor. The film also boasts enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. Any older person beware.
