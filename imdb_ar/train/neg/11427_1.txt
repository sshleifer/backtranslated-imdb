I do not know who is Sue Kramer, the director of this film, but I have serious doubts that a) she is lesbian and b) I somehow envied everyone involved in this project to participate in proving that it is not homophobia. I can imagine that everyone is thinking, "My God, this is terrible, not funny, pedestrian, totally lame." But keeping their mouths shut for fear of being labeled as anti-gay or "not getting" gay lifestyle. (Maybe that's why Kramer does not throw gay people to play gay too). In any case, it is not worth reviewing. All actors are directed to play each scene fully so that there is no truth or belief in anything they do. It's full of clich√©s and nothing about this movie is less fun - less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated him and I'm not afraid to say that. The very bad people who were given money to make the bomb were not biased in their judgment.
