This film is prominent for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, taking advantage of the success of the Superman series, this low budget feature was created and put on stage, celebrating George Reeves and Felice Coates. Initial appearances such as Clark Kent / Superman and Lewis Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a well penetrates six miles of oil "hollow ground" allowing the "mole men" to reach the surface. Forget the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike most SS invasion films in the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant role in preaching, imposing tolerance and accepting differences. Against the mobs of the people of apartheid. No "polite polite reporter" here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and determined, controls the situation all the time ("I'll deal with this!"), Even helping the hospital gown remove the bullet from the mole man! As Superman, he is nicer than Clark toward the belligerent Lewis, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he attacks revelers as "Nazi Storm Soldiers." <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from the animated animation of Flair to Superman in the series "The Living Motion" in "The Adventures of Superman" has not yet taken place.
