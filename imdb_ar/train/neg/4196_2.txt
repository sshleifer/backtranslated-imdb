This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Not only the story, but acting very bad. The dialog box looks like someone reading the news. <br /> <br /> This movie has been classified as Comedy / Drama / Romance, it's not like that! It's a little work, that's all. There is no comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to see it, I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Pretty much anything else you choose to look will be the best. This is largely a motion / crime film. Sucking scenes of events, part of the crime story was highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story or acting well. And simply want to look at the film "foreigner" to attract foreigners. Then this may be for you.
