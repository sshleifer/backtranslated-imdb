Maybe this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is in Cond√©ra's novel. It's not that it can not be solved. It's just like 99% of his work, it's buzz and packed up. He seems to admire his charm, and his characters appear to be staring at the navel, and his novels as a whole are offensive to women. I read a lot of his works (even his socialist realist poetry - that was so bad) - I do not understand what the fuss is. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels make them irritate reading. In the film, all the things I do not like about Condira have been magnified. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. In a side note, I can not believe that this DVD is a Criterion set. In no way is this film necessary.
