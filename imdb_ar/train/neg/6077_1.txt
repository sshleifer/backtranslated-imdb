Will anyone really see this RUBBISH if it does not contain young children running naked? From a cinematic point of view, this may be one of the worst films I've ever faced. Some people woke up one day and thought I was going to make a movie with little girls and call it art, and I grabbed it in the countryside and there's no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they do not seem to live anywhere or have parents because movies p * rn do not need anything like that. I would like to comment on the rest of the film but I did not get caught up in the spoilers, so I just say avoid and avoid and find yourself a suitable film to watch it
