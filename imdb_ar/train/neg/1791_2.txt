What is the mysterious video at first and intermittently throughout the film? It looks as if someone has put mud water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity may turn some people off, but, along with bad representation, is often what makes a good cult film I suppose. <br /> <br /> My favorite plan is connected by Tarquin the Vampire, "Unfortunately, your family is stupid." Well, no one should say "sadly" in any film unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The character of Van Helsing and the bad girl Raleigh is not bad. I also liked Little Little's Master Little. Wicked martial arts! Do not take it seriously and you will enjoy it.
