Wow, I finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this terrible film, just to see that Rick Sloan and his production team have completed a direct sequel to the video this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the films reviewed by the MST3K - literally dug from the bottom of the drum - they show "Manos", "Werewolf", "The Wreewolf" and "The St" are amazingly weird, less familiar with disasters such as "Laserblast "" Zombie Nightmare "and" Time Hunt "- this must surely be the largest pile of trash they have ever shown (making it ideal for rafting.) Quite simply, the film revolves around a bunch of precious trees that resemble Munchies on the floor, And exploits people's desires for fame, wealth, ingenuity, and, of course, sex in ways that end in death, but this is the kind of film in which acting is ridiculous (a test of the makiso For example, by two young men wrestling in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is very forced (like the description often followed) a scene of a Kremlin hanging on the arm of one girl will notice that, if she turned her head four to the left ... This is not the time The first in this film that happens), and the story is so ... rarely paid attention (hence the MST3K team revolves around "the future law where FILMmakers have to make movies), you are actually grounded on furry dolls to kill everyone on the screen. Worst movie ... ever.
