This film is outrageous. By obscene, I mean awful. I got more pleasure watching the paint dry in my local shop on a busy day while suffering from migraine and stroke. Representation became progressively worse as the film progressed, and the use of emotional directors became apparent as the final scenes approached. When the foggy shot was fired to death, I decided it was wise to close my gums. This was not smart. Honestly, Stevie Wonder can be caught with his eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun while you are tight and watch this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun may give you a better story to tell your friends.
