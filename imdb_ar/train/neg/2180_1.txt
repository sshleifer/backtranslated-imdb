From where to start, there are a lot of mistakes and horror in this film, I'm not sure where to start. Well, the two people who wrote this creature. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first were unable to offset their so-called minds. I think they split the difference, which is why the main headline is the brain that did not die, but the final screen says it will not die. No one knows anything about the medical profession. After all doctors swear oath "do not hurt." The killing of a woman in the head transplant is considered "harmful". In addition, little thing is called matching blood and tissue. Rejection will lead to Jean's death in the pan. In addition to which keeps the monster working patch. What is the Faculty of Medicine from which Bell graduated, Frankenstein University? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The beast had no name, and it bothered me. In addition, the brilliant surgeon, Doctor Bill Kortner, does not know how to keep the patient sedated? All this and a movie disaster, it is incredibly stupid and can not be accessed, except MST3K. I give her thanks Turkey.
