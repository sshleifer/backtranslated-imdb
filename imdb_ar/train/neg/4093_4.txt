The plot and characters are silly and barely qualified as a "conspiracy" and a "personal". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus, fuzzy. The fact that Fulci filled the whole film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely strange and full of sex and violence. The contradictions are rather amusing. One of the main characters says he has no friends, but he holds the new man within a minute of the screen, and has a large number of women on the side. Although he shows his anti-social tendencies by placing a stock randomly in some poor people who care only about his own affairs, the images of blood or flowing gore are more interesting than the characters, but what do you want from Folsi? . Maybe he ruined his career, but it was not more stupid than zombie. Worth the rent if you love wonderful Italian clicks or you are desperate for the sword and sorcery or something strange. How do you sleep through someone who is sucking into the hole of two feet from your head and screaming for help?
