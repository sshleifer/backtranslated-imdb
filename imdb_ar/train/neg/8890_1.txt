For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did very well. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with the good thing, are we? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogue could have been more sensibly presented. The remaining actors are needed to group them together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are not you dead yet, Romeo? The actor was not, though not only woody and completely painful, but he could not read his lines with any stupidity at all. He was completely out of focus and had trouble looking at Juliet in his face, and there was no grace at all with the lines given to him. Whoever casts it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost acceptable, but does not give depth to her character, and seems to be far from the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for his entire dialog box. Benfolio was ruthless with his lines. <br /> <br /> I had to carry this production half the cache for Romeo and Juliet. Representation was represented by fashion and was less distracting. I have seen puppet shows for puppies with more effort in them. I just wish I could give this movie a zero rating.
