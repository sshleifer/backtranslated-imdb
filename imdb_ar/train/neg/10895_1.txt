I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a horror movie of what it is now. But this requires a bad truth to come to a new end. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, a conspiracy that never goes anywhere and takes time. There are no shocks, no terror, no suspense, just a burden of men who unburden themselves for an hour and a half then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A look at the kind of crazy horror, avoided at all costs. <br /> <br />
