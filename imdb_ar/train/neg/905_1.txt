An unmarried woman named Stella (Pete Meidler) is pregnant by a rich man (Stephen Collins). The marriage is offered out of commitment, but it is rejected and the child is decided to raise the child alone. Things are going well until Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually become (and are) expected to get worse. <br /> <br /> You've seen the silent version and audio version of "Stella Dallas". No one hurt me very much (and I cry easily), but they were good in history. Trying to reshape this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think that Medler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of the "Beaches" to get this. This (expected) bombardment. The story is funny and dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado perform well, this film lasts long and I'm bored at the end. Stephen Collins and Marcha Mason (both good actors) do not help support roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thinks this will work? See the 1937 version of Stanwyck instead. I give this 1.
