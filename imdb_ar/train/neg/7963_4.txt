I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle-aged, my age is a film that was produced before 1970 and was mostly made in the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a fan of modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was awesome. I was able to mention the stories there, but I really enjoyed the monster in the box with Hal Holbrooke, and the story about the clean guy really was a wonderful ending. All the stories were wonderful though. Why do I love them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, and the morale of terror grew close to the fear of fear, and the funny footage was really funny! This sequel largely lacks these elements or is completely absent! I write this after I saw it partly because the movie was totally waste of time and I shut it off to do other things like writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamor get old bills, he tells you something ... 4 out of 10. Also, it's hard to find Romero's experience here, they should have told him to paint it according to the PG standard (I do not do not know what was evaluated but Seems to be PG for me), and this is not a good thing for a movie where nothing else happens. It is displayed on the Encore cable channel if you have a die (yuck yuck) to see it.
