Praise be to Allaah. I saw this in a friend's place and did not pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent and the entire film felt like a ring of PBS. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, watch out. You will feel that the film is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also, the actress turned into Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh and it shows the worst behavior I have seen, except pornography. It's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the person who carries the film. <br /> <br /> I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! It is shameful to call it sequel, because I was a fan of origin, which was really good.
