I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 in a fairly large video retailer to do some indie research because I just finished editing and now when I'm worried about my first-time skills, just sit with a plate of cookies and severed . Within minutes I feel good !!! <br /> <br /> I hate to talk to another film director so I just use constructive criticism. 1. Look for good actors. When it helps you capture video, you can highlight the viewer and darkness in your computer later after it's posted. 3. Clips are best for video 4. When a representative enters a scene, wait a little bit before <br /> <br /> make them talk until we know what is going on and who is speaking. 5. Never appear behind the door while waiting for someone to open it. Damn you $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> The real horror is getting Seved reviews on IMDb, and you have to give these people the balance ... they've been distributed.
