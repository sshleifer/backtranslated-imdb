I really wanted to like this film, but much of it is stolen / borrowed from other works - some borrowing is painfully stark. The New York Times review showed that their singing frog reminded us horribly in Warner Bros.'s famous animated film, "Hello my baby, hello my dear, welcome to ragtime." But I challenge anyone to watch Robots (2005) for the Fox / Blue Sky animation and find no silly similarities in: Story - the inventor of a growing young man, and a creative company that distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> cityscape - Very similar camera angles capture very similar future city environments. <br /> <br /> ... Robots ... - Robots server in the Robinson family has a design very similar to that in Robots, and both films use a kind of futuristic look to the past. <br /> <br /> This seems to be in sharp contrast to the hateful quote from Disney in the end, which means that the company was a consistent innovator never looking back (which also contradicts the entire list of films in the 1990s which was a clone Largely to each other, with minor modifications to the story and race). <br /> <br /> The directors seem unable to let the story speak on its own, and instead, you can always send objects and noise in our direction even though we have no interest in anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is well designed and skillfully designed, and he is happy to see him. It seems that the bulk of the rest of the film is thrown together. Some landscapes look like CGI from the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. At the end of these cartoons, we are reminded that Disney has never been much interested in innovation or good storytelling - they seem to think that just getting something on the big screen is enough proof of their virtues.
