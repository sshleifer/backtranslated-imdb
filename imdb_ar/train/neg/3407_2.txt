Well, forget all the technical contradictions or physical impossibles of a space shuttle that was accidentally launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. Forget the hideous special effects and monolithic characters of bad construction. Just look at the premise of the story. The main reason for the film's existence is in the first place, and you'll see how poorly this film is dismantled together. <br /> <br /> I know that nine-year-olds look at this insult to intelligence and laugh only at it. The story is appalling. Comic representation and the message that tries to show are incomprehensible. What's worse, is that the channels of cable movies keep showing it! In twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone think in his right mind that people want to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, much less to see it at all? <br /> <br /> My recommendation does not even bother spending the energy to see this thing. It is not worth it.
