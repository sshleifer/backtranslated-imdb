Steve Carpenter can not produce horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this film. The only decent part was the girl with the warm brown hair of the deadly vampire buffy. These films do not contain material (usually a major component of a horror film), no action, no action, no suspense (also a major component). Wes Bentley is a good actor but dry and dry in this matter to the point that he is sad. There were some parts that were supposed to be funny (continue horror movies / teen comedy) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this film got an R rating, and I was not interested and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you like I still know what I did last summer. This is the only kind of people who will find this scary film remotely. And seriousness, this is you Steve Carpenter, stop producing horror movies. This film makes a cry look like a Texas Massacre Massacre.
