A group of stupid cars that do not think about the plane that was assembled in a matter of hours by unmanned mechanics (led by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche racecar powered by decades-old gasoline sludge Lee Magors, with Chris Macbis for peace as a technical expert - who can spare McGyver into a wireless receiver that can pick up all the frequencies simultaneously, who somehow learned how to get the chemicals and use them to make high explosives in a completely peaceful society. As a fool as it seems. A terrible waste of Bridges Meredith, but Chris Makpis may be forgiven at least on the grounds that this is his second film only.
