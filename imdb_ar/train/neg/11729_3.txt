The Virgin was chosen to marry a rich man. Rich urination. A woman on a boat loves the seas. Sailor pee. The Virgin attends the Municipal Dinner. A man urinating at the dinner table. The boat does not tease the bar for the young boy. A man pretends to urinate. There is a theme inherent here. Makavejev tries to say that he is far from the world. To say that this strange film is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene where Lauhr bathe, barely speaking ten lines in the entire film, in a chocolate syrup. It's a really wonderful scene but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the person unless someone happens to take part in directing the director.
