"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the most famous 1950s films about many teenagers facing the supernatural. In this case, teenagers can not pay the rent for their Hangout and expel them. With nowhere else to go, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you may have guessed, once they arrive, some strange things begin to occur. There is a twist in the end. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's a nice entertainment though. My favorite character was the nasty parrot. Well, let me redraft the following: He did not speak like a character in Quentin Tarantino, but he said things we do not expect from birds. The film is pure hokum, but harmless.
