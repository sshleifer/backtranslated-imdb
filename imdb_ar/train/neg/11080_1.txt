You should love low budget cheesy movies. This one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad behavior (really bad). In addition, every time I see Mercedes McNab (sister), I still think "Watch out!" It's great! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> An ideal example of what happens when someone has bad taste and wants to waste money in getting a click, and the little that is spent of course I do not know if I feel sorry The writer of the film or the producer who did not recover any money. <br /> <br /> I say it is good for young children in its simplicity, but I do not know if I want to subject a child to him ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because this is the minimum.
