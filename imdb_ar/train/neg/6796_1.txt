Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how it can be to have sex with a dog (an animal abuse, too) amusing or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these kinds of films fuel the flames of hatred and increase feelings of hatred towards women. This society continues to depict women as sexual objects, unlike humans. We call ourselves "civilized," but I feel that we still have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of civilization.
