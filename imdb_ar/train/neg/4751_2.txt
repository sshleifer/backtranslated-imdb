First of all, when I saw a teaser trailer for Wu Wendy, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of Disney Channel's hottest girls, was martial arts and I was fine ... until I saw the movie. The action was not good, and it was not possible for the film to realize that the fighting was unrealistic and could absorb it ... along with the plot. If you're really thinking of being my vampire with a slayer, a girl from the baskets of other female warriors, wants a girl to ignore her call and want to become a homecoming queen, who is watching her and getting ready for her. Fight some old evil. The idea was not all that was original, the film was a waste of time.
