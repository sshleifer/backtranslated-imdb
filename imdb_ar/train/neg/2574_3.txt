I know that films do not necessarily reflect reality, but this film has hit me with nerves. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "trauma" and mental illness. I've been doing the "Psychic Mom" ​​thing many times before (and usually it is better) and much of the rest of the plot is also elusive. The acting was not terrible but there was no reason to rave. Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you can overlook the false analytical part of it, in the same way a person should suspend the reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, this movie may be acceptable. If you do not have something better to do and fairly low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
