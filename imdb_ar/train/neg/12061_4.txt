Charles Brunson plays the role of Lt. Col. Crow, the police investigator who declares war on a pirate named Duke (Juan Fernandez) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who sexually harassed the daughter of Crowe (Amy Hathaway) in this vengeful film. Kinjite may not be for everyone with a rather disturbing plot thread but it is well made and already enjoyable.
