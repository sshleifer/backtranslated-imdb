Anyone who saw the original should come out and destroy this dreadful new version. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve McQueen in a speech about a remake not only works. While Baldwin has some impressive works, he flips from start to finish. McQueen had charisma and never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw, Kafi said. McQueen looked dangerous, threatening and a friend like Doc, aroused excitement and suspense in the film, and Baldwin and his friends made this comedy, I laughed at one, and when I saw this miserable film only. This dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of the most exciting and credible actors of the day! Did people install it for Michael, what they were thinking. If you want to see the film industry in the way it was under the supervision of Sam Peckinpah Get the original!
