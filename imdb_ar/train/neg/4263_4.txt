The film is disappointing. Performance of weak actors. Groups were fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. The battle sequences are terrifying. Sounds and movie quality are trash. The history of the Kazakh people was said to be very bad. This film should have included more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And also should be in the Kazakh language. Cono Baker and Jay Hernandez of Hispanic origin. I do not understand that. Since when did the Spanish people play the Turkish-Mongolian people? This film is a shame on Kazakh cinema. Rostam Ibrahimibov disappointed me. He is one of the best directors in the world. Director of the Czekh Maathar, because he is not a Bedouin, can not know the true spirit and history of nomads.
