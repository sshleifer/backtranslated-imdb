First, let me say that I am not a fan of the Dukes, but after this film, the series looked like "law and order". The worst thing was pouring Rusko and Boss Hogg. Bert Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse is M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if ever seen the Roscoe show was not a cop ass hard. Barney Fife was more than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> The movie was loaded with the usual mistakes, the cars torn apart, and still happening as nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the general meets Billy Brickett, and the general faces a dirt hill that slows down quite clearly, but he goes on to win the race.
