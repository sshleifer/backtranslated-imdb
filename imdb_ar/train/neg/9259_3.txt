"The Omen 4: The Awakening" is a dedicated sequel to the TV for the original film "The Omen". Rather than possessing the body of a young boy, Satan has the body of a young girl adopted by wealthy parents who are harassed at school and end up avenging those who commit them. It seems that the film is struggling with any factor of horror, and many of the events that occur are simply silly and not very frightening, and it is hard to believe that this little girl is the devil, even with all the events that surround him. I just did not find this movie very disturbing or scary, especially when compared to the original.
