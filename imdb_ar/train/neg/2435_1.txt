I would caution you here: I chose to believe these reviewers who said that this was not an action film in the usual sense, but a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on this basis and you will be fine. <br /> I'm here to tell you they were wrong. A complete error. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not quite; it's very disappointing if you're looking for a flick job, they're right in it. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels as well. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not so bad, I think, not worse than usual; but what did they have to throw Billy Zane into this? Was it a kind of desire for death by producers? A way to make their movie flop guaranteed? In this case, the command succeeded. <br /> <br /> If they are really aiming to succeed, why not throw someone who can act? Oh, maybe it goes well for a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yeah, the director who knows how to manage. <br /> <br /> As someone who sat in this mess and thought they would soon be free, I can assure you that they never did. Unfortunately it may be a good film.
