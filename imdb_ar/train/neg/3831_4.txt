I will disagree with the previous comment and along with Maltin about this comment. This is the second rate, the excessively evil Western who tries to scream and ears to put his main theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked through the course of time fixed. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but he lacks this lavish film and magic. The direction of Andrew McLaughlin is weak, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real idea, with some incomprehensible strategies by Charlton Charleston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a scream if you can explain to me why they set fire to the side of the hill). There was something harsh about the full treatment of the rape scene, and then the woman's reaction was certainly not true. Coburn is so bad that half the strain that survived the conviction owes revenge, but all his fellow fugitives are not backward (resembling bowling pins that are torn down one by one as the story unfolds) Michael Parkes offers one of his vague and opaque displays, but in this case That was appropriate because the symbol of his modern style symbolized the satisfaction that technological progress could bring.
