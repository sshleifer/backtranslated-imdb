I do not watch too much television and I watch this show. Reality? I hope this is not true. If I were a man and I had such a panic and married a very mucous person, it would be a reason for divorce. I think it provides a bad example of how a person treats someone he loves. This is something wrong in our world now. There are many people who have selfishly bad relations and do not know what they really love. It is self-sacrifice and not something that should be on Merritt. This does not give one a very good feeling, to see what you should have in your own counseling. If his character in the program is real, he deserves a much better person who would show his true true love and care and appreciate him for who he is. Is this a realistic offer or an assessment of ???? I really like to know. Sincerely, GB
