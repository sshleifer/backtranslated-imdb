... but the keyword here is "usually". I know that I love films that everyone thinks are stupid. But in the world of B-rated films, this video was rated Z. Totally silly. The thing I respect most of my favorite movies of class B is that they do not take themselves seriously. Filmmakers treat this kind of film lightly, even if it is a heavy subject. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film took themselves very seriously, as if they were combining 10-class classics, complemented by bad attempts at touching lines and stupid camera shots. However, despite all this, I have given it 4 out of 10 stars, so I am biased towards films like this. If you are impressed with B, however, I will try hard to find this.
