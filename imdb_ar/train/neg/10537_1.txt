Well, what can you say about adapting Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reid, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but obviously they are seeking money. <br /> <br /> Lisette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Copthorne-Anthony wrestles with Hugh Grant (who seems appropriately awkward) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the "startling" adaptation of Cartland, Bonham Carter is the one for ("Danger of Hearts" - his nickname !!). Gilbert is the weak link in it, but Bonham Carter is appropriately beautiful and of course can act, and the rest of the actors play it to the end with tongues tightly in the cheek (Edward Fox and Diana Reg)
