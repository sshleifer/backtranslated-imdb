I read the Reaper of Ben Mezrich a few years ago and last night I came by mistake to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Despite years of reading the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the film is humongous. The very important elements, which made the whole thing reasonable, are written or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot looks exciting to you: Go and get the novel. It is much better. <br /> <br /> It is still 4 out of 10 because it was hard to stop watching because of the great core conspiracy of the Meisrich son.
