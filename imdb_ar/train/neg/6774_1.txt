As an enthusiast for Gary Grant, I was expecting to watch this movie and howling with laughter, as AMC called it a comedy. I was not more disappointed than the movie! The usual charm of Cary and the wonderful comedy are two films of a full movie. I have encountered him tense and bored not just himself. The Mississip character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever seen - its tone is horribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to any part of Mississippi that it claims to originate from). The more lines you make, the higher the number of decibels than any other member casts. Mississip tried to present himself in the film as a favorite goofball game from the countryside, but in the end he managed only to detract from the already weak conspiracy. Mansfield looks more like a puppet than a little doll in Hollywood, and while she was not known for her ability to act, the film screams that she did not have that ability at all. The character of Ray and Sixty was intrigued and intrigued in the end. For four men on a beach vacation, that was the most wonderful vacation I've ever seen. I have seen this nightmare to the end, and while I will not spoil it for anyone, I will tell you that it is more absurd than you will ever see it. The film tries to ignite patriotism and a sense of religion to fight, but the film misses this point entirely because of its weak line and poor representation. Sorry, Carrie!
