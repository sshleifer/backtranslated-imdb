I did not read Lincoln's biography, so perhaps this was an accurate picture ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is because I am used to portraying both alien and unrealistic worship that Lincoln's extraordinary, honorable and loyal obsession is peculiar to our country. ..... <br /> <br /> But why do they make a film that represents Lincoln as a leopard? While Henry Fonda did an excellent Lincoln job, his portrayal of him as "sudden tremors, I'm just a simple man" seemed a bit humiliating. <br /> <br /> [Granted, this was all Bushi Jr.. The campaign, to make us believe that he was "just a normal man" so we do not care about him as a rich and distinctive idiot - but this is another full story. <br /> <br /> Not only did the film portray Lincoln as a kind of simple man Semi-simple thinking), the film mentions that Lincoln had entered into the law by accident, and that he was not interested in this law - just by the idea of ​​simplification of the wrong law being about rights and mistakes. He is not a good defense lawyer in the film (lounging with his feet on the table and making fun of witnesses), and the outcome is often determined by accident / luck. <br /> <br /> Moreover, in part because this was funded by Republicans (in reaction to a drama sponsored by Democrats that came out) and partly because it was just a sense of age, the film unfortunately is religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this movie!
