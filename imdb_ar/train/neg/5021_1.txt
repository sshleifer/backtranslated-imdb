This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, and the dialogue was terrible and representative. I'm not sure if this film was the result of a homework project, but it certainly played as one. It is not particularly successful in its central concept of trying to emerge as one continuous process. The lush horizontal camera basins are a cheap and non-genuine way to hide cuts.
