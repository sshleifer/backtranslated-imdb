This movie is pure guano. My mother always says if you can not say anything nice ... but until my mother says I have to do my part to warn others about this film. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the movie that Jeffrey Rush would only go away. I hope Greg Kenner fired his agent .. from a cannon to give him the text. After this, Ben Stiller may have been praying in order to paint someone "there is still something about Mary." You've always been a fan of Wes Stoudie, thanking everything you see sacred because he wore a mask through the film, so people might not know the movie with him. <br /> <br /> The parody of Batman's filmmaking begins in an artistic way, and then loses something ... like a coherent plot and half-decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline appears, and even then it falls off. If you want to see an effective parody of the comic book world, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! Do not walk away from the Mysterious Man!
