This film is a stark attempt by the Hollywood left to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and effective. There may have been some mistakes in the time of the crisis, but I'm sure not as much as was filmed in this lame movie. My first reaction was that this film was directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There seem to be many others.
