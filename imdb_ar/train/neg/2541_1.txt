I did not see the original film in the series ... I just hope it is a better film than this or a sequel made in the 1980s as if it was not justified. This film made good progress when it was announced to be shown on one of those old independent stations that have become something of the past now. Anyway, it looked like a very good scary movie. However, the movie would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Truly, this film was just a bunch of light fluff with no crunchy creature bog to see. The only real vision comes to an end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, otherwise there is almost no sign of the creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically that bad hunters must kill anything they see and that after the suffocating creature full of children and children abroad to help them or just a random haired person in the forest likes to pull random boats across the water. Not really worth watching, but I want to see the original version, which gave its maker would also make the poor creature swamp in the eighties, but made a very good film in the seventies the "The Town the Dreaded Sundown."
