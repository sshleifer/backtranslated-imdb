I found that the documentary entitled "Fast, Cheap, Out of Control" is a fairly interesting documentary film. The documentary contained four "small" documentaries of four interesting men. Each of these men was very engaged in his job, showing love and enjoyment of his mission. <br /> <br /> The sad part must be the subjects in which these individuals worked. . It was interesting for five minutes and then it became quite boring and durable for a long time. <br /> <br /> The video was filmed in a very innovative way. I enjoyed the movie a lot with a voice that the other describes. They played out excellent and also matched well with the music.
