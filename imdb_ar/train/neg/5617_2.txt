This documentary is based on incomplete considerations of evidence, where Brian Fleming, perhaps intentionally, failed to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the oldest errors: His claims about the invalidity of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ ignore the main facts, such as: the existence of certain beliefs formulated in Paul's epistles. These beliefs indicate that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated in terms of faith perhaps within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** The testimony of early Christians can not be ignored as mere fantasy. In fact, there were many people who claimed to be the Messiah during that period, but only Jesus remained. why? Because it was useless for anyone to actually believe that Christ is Christ, and goes for these beliefs, if they know that he was not resurrected from the resurrection. ** Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about the accounts of Jesus that were written during the lives of other eyewitnesses who had referred to errors in these Gospels. There is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased act that serves itself and overshadows various arguments and evidence to serve its anti-Christian point of view. Do not be fooled by a weak investigation.
