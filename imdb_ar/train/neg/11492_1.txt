How can a major German television station broadcast such anarchy? It's amazing how major actors avoid all the talent of acting - even the famous John Gottfried behaves very badly - especially in the double murder scene - how amateur .... The screen plan is very extended - perhaps to fill two parts of the film. Be careful not to sleep while watching! The group is obviously a blue screen, for example the scenes on the ship with the unreal sea in the background ...! The German version of sound and dubbing is very bad - maybe the reason: different languages ​​of the actors - but: other international productions deal with this more professionally. Tip: Do not see - it's a Satanic waste of time!
