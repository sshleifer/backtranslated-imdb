It was good to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first film. Why does the second focus on her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like this conspiracy. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes is no longer Eric's voice! Disney, please stop reproducing classic movies with this lousy tradition.
