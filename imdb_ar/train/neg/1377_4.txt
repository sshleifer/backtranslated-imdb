This type of volleyball is oddly ignored by most screenwriters. Fortunately, the highly acclaimed director, Nelson McCormick, gave us the second best volleyball film of all time (we got a lower rating than Side Out and above). However, do not let the cover of this movie frustrate you. Kill the Kill Shoot stars up and the coming star Koji as the modern Holmes Holmes. Using high-tech tools such as a less powerful computer than Gameboy, the Koji is able to help FBI agents track down a man who has not committed any clear crime. While there are other actors in the film, including a short veil by Dennis Richards, my gay husband, and an ugly, annoying and disturbing girl, Koji carries the film alone. Surely anyone who likes movies like The Matrix or Hackers will like Kill Shot.
