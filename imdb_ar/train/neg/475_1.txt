One of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this film in the American history chapter and it was meant to see the instigation of farmer life in the West in the late nineteenth century. What we have seen is the shooting of pigs and then slaughtering them, human birth, and branding. In the end, there was a live birth of the calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was not very bad, but the many fluids that came out pushed most of the people in my classroom into the bathroom. The story itself was good. The story's premise is a widow and her daughter and move to the west to be the guard of the cowboy house. They live a life of hardship, and it is interesting to see accurate life in the West during the late nineteenth century. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.
