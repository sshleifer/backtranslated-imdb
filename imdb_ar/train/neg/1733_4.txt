SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> < > Suffering from "corneal phobia," Oles begins a journey on a "comfortable" boat, but he and Stan are in contact with the condemned man (Richard Kramer). Chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> This long-length comedy - a good entry that is still unobtrusive like a tradition of the best work of Laurel and Hardy - represents the ultimate collaboration between L & H and Hal Roach. The film has a transverse structure, culminating in an unforgettable journey to the ocean after the Boys were taken hostage by the evil Cramer (who shoots the seagulls to prove his strength!). Gags are fine, but the inspiration is not available, perhaps because of the hiring of the actor who turned out to be the director of Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for the first solo effort of the ZENOBIA, which was produced in 1939, pzazz. Just, but nothing special. L & H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make a guest match.
