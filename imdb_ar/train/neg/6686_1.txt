There is no spot of entertainment in this entire film. There is no one scary, funny or even interesting scene in this film. She declares herself terrifying, and then calls herself a comedy. Do not even try humor. Do not try to be scary. <br /> <br /> So do not be bored by this movie, you must be one of the most easy people on earth. If you like this movie, even to LITTLE BIT, you do not have any standard for what you see at all. I have a very difficult time trying to understand what filmmakers are trying to accomplish. It's not funny, scary, shocking, or seditious. Was it supposed to be a drama? Because in fact it was not dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please just prefer yourself and do not watch this movie. Life is so precious that it does not waste 90 minutes of it.
