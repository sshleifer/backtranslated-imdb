What can I say? I think I should write "Vandal Alert" and then "Reveal" used the word F-LOT in this movie - as in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - lots of hints about sex deviations, side effects and cheating. This insults was completely out of the window. This film "3" and two of those points were given to the dramatic movements of Mira Sorvino in the dance floor.
