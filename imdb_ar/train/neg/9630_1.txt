I realized that many of Ben Stiller's films had come out or would be finished this year, but perhaps he had to insist on quality rather than quantity. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at what filmmakers thought was a comedy in "Along Came Polly". <br /> <br /> Stiller Robin is an annoying and beautiful place and is rated as one of the worst performances of the year. Stellar schtick is getting cumbersome. No doubt he has a comic talent, but he needs either to find another schtick or take a break, and find some really ridiculous stuff. Because his films move from painful humor to painfully painful. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stellar and Jennifer Aniston, a shame because she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she continues to produce more films such as "The Good Girl" and "Like Cing Polly", she will have a career that she might be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the awkward things she works in, but it is a daunting task for any actress. Except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as club president Robin Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Robin's best friend, there is nothing funny about this horrible film. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's tone was not only stupid, but also highly inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis of "Along Came Polly" clearly demonstrated the promise. Unfortunately, she needed a writer who could actually turn her into a good comedy, instead of this boring boring and boring excuse for comedy.
