Che's appeal and appearance have a great relationship with his characteristic status, such as the misinformation published by the leftist propaganda (such a film) about him. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is worse: to be caught by a Che killing squad or having to sit for 4 hours of this normally Soderberghian litter. The question is not why this project was made for pets, but what took this long time. I mean, of course, Hollywood leftist and "secret" love of the Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... choose). I am intrigued that it took decades for even one of the less talented liberal directors in Tinseltown to make such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Betty? Alan Bacula? George Clooney? Barbara Streisand up? It's a mystery. All these "artists" are often immersed in similar, politically-related projects. However, Che Guevara, who is considered a more communist and famous communist, was not the subject of their film so far. <br /> <br /> "Gang warfare" contains all the hallmarks of an American story of truth-finding from an epic realm; there are many real details to be found here, as in Hollywood-like political fantasy-like mega-theaters such as Malcolm X "or" Gandhi ", ie almost nothing. The stars play the role of Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. However, regardless of this man's controversial and criminal behavior, there was one thing no one could take away from him: he had clever maneuvers from a wealthy family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an exciting and attractive actor, and may resemble Guevara physically, but he does not produce any intellectual qualities of any kind, so he makes Guevara superior to being very primitive. The portrayal of such medium novels as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only emphasizes the lack of good governance. <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly too slow (no surprise there) and is not visually interested. Even the brilliant director like Kubrick was thinking carefully about the release of a film that exceeded 3 hours, so it is clear that this Soderbergh, who produced only one or two solid films early in his career, was thought to have had his peripheral grandeur up to this task. If you think the length of the film indicates that the bulk of Chi's life has appeared here - think again. Soderbergh focuses on the last stage of Chi, a lot of nonsense film missed a dull, full of the alleged idealism of Guevara. (I do not have mentally ill ideals). I wonder what kind of mind this very esteemed director should actually choose to ignore to ignore some of Chi's previous life. Do you really consider it interesting? The massacre of 600 people does not interest the viewer, huh? amazing. Some directors are much better than this acclaimed juggler, it was not easy to fit into one complete biography, but two full episodes in a four-hour film. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a sense, becomes a partner by not addressing the negatives at all, the dark side - more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracies, ignoring the ugly truth of consciousness (God forbid to pollute the sacred image of Che), Soderberg proves that he is not human - a fake image. Most Hollywood and pop characters wrestle fiercely with all their professions to cling to - but Conversely, he only cares about ideas, not about people whose ideas are tested on them (like Guinean pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst species. These people often have the inherent contempt for the "proletariat" (a stupid term) they are supposed to deviate from. <br /> <br /> Half of the students around the world wear a chi image on their red and orange shirts, but without knowing why it has become a creative figure for ignorant, ignorant, and often young people who think that by putting this The man on his chest, somehow makes them appear "animated", intellectual, or warm or fun. In fact, the wearing of the Qi shirt only highlights the total desolation and lack of full attention to self-education. (Do not you want to know more about someone before you start advertising their face / face to the world?) It became commonplace to wear a cliche cliche from Che like eating a Bart Simpson coffee cup. It is likely that all of these "wearing a Che" will know Marge Blue's poetry more than they might read about dead Fidel Castro's ally. <br /> <br /> After all was done in the name of Marx, one might think that these Moroccan "ideals" will finally be put to rest. It seems that mankind will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain, 100 million dead, more than a billion people were physically and / or mentally ruined by this system ... so nothing matters, right? <br /> <br /> The victory of Del Toro in Cannes should not surprise those who are not fully aware of how the Cannes Festival and other European festivals - and vote. Hint: Chun-jin headed the jury not long ago. <br /> <br /> For music related issues, visit: http://rateeyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
