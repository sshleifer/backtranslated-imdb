Tromaville High became an immoral land of filth due to the consequences of the indirect release of toxic waste from the nearby nuclear reactor. <br /> <br /> The unrestrained chaos is full of silly violence and crude behavior. Rather horrifying, is clearly meant to be a mess for a film in which directors take the lead, allowing untrained disobedience to liberate it. Kraft was away from the list of Troma goals for this hapless. The honor society is the bad guys with strange face paint jobs and wacky costumes. The German teacher who becomes a member, through a "poisonous kiss" has lines down the side of her face that really gave me a crawl. The poisonous beast, who sent the nagging bad guys to the end, is awesome. br /> <br /> It will embrace a large amount of film trash experts.
