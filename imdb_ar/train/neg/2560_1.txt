Well, I've watched this last night and the only thing that did not make it absolutely awesome is that it was straight forward. There was no beating around the bush that this child was a harbinger of Christ. However the film was only poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dentist accident an "accident" or, finally, how the policeman miraculously ended up at home in time to save the child without calling the police so far. The scenes of death were very bad and not at all amusing. The child who chose the game against Christ was boring and they could actually choose a better child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
