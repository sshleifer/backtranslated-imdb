I do not know how this movie received a lot of positive comments on this site! I'm a big fan of vonnegut and I'm familiar with the story of Showtime's original film, which was beyond imagination, but even if I were not, the bad acting, the very bad portrayal (Sean Astin is the prominent person and the athlete, Harrison? The man is quite public!) And the substandard writing made these intestines hardly seen. Someone pointed out how wonderful Macaulay Kolkin's line was. If I read that and thought it was a purely hilarious brilliance (unfortunately, perhaps the most funny part of the film), you might like this movie. But if you are a fan of Vonnegut or not completely crazy, do not see it. Please.
