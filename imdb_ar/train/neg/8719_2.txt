Well, I go with another B industry film. It is sad enough to see some bad-made films but I do not care whether the industry B or C industry produces the film. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. Representation is not questioned in this (surprise), but the plot is. How can a narrow band witness two of their fellow soldiers slaughtered, then continue as if nothing happened. What amazed me was how the writer gave the other members a scene where they were joking about the beauty of the ass. Give me a break.
