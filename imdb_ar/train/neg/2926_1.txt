There seems to be a bit of a curse when it comes to gay cinema. Happy endings are not very common. Beautiful things excluded, gay films tend to end broken relationships or sudden death. Some, like Come Undone, just end ... period. <br /> <br /> Creators in this appalling piece of nonsense have one or two things to learn about plot, direction, and timetables. During the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a bit confused, even more so after the first look at Jeremy's character after a small psychic session. This film seems to have been assembled at random without the slightest attempt at continuity or continuity. There is no real way to know when you are presenting the present or a kind of flash-ethereal flash. I could only handle a lot before it became really unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of the New York Times described the film as "... very beautiful and completely glamorous." Well, Steven seems to have invested in beer glasses before watching, because this is too far from beauty. Because of all the praise I received this film, I was expecting something worth watching. Unfortunately, the film lives up to its title. By the end of the film (which did not make any decision at all, it may be added), it's easy to see that the book, director and film are all "Come Undone".
