It is very good to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, however, I was expecting something more creative than Togan Gokbakar. Starting with the script, which I think was not as wise a script as some might think. Especially harassment dialog boxes, which put the audience in a position, as if they were not smart enough to understand attitudes, making the film most likely improbable. It also has a clear end; you can easily guess the killer from the start. The weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of patients with serious mental illnesses act like natural persons, like professionals immediately !!! Do you look for the possibility of patients who are under heavy medical, to work like a professional and use all medical terminology that even ordinary people can not use ????? !!!!!! Also at the scene where the staff was looking for the most serious patient, with no weapon to protect themselves was another strange point in the film. This scene was very appropriate title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not the only weak parts of the film. There was also a lot of precision in the film. The most dangerous portrayal of the patient was an accurate copy of Hannibal, and the appearance of Toujan in the end was the worst mistake he could make in his first film! A fuss about the film's greatness and the interviews the actor made made people curious and forced to see him. The general is a complete disappointment. I was wondering, if Sahan was not famous, would Togan be able to shoot this film, with so much budget? I hope Tujan realizes that it is not unusual to play a role as an director, he said in an interview. Hitchcock was the one who did it wisely and this night of Shiyamalan continued successfully! Must be aware of the fact that it is neither Hitchcock nor Sheamalan yet !!!! Hoping to be more cautious and creative next time in this big industry!
