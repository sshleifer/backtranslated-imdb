FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> < Stan Ann Ellis mixed up with a couple of sleeping birds (Kay Delis and Vera White) after going out to visit the theater that burns in their absence! Needless to say, their oppressive wives (Vivian Oakland and Pais) are not amusing ... <br /> <br /> The Lucky Makari comedy OK has set a narrative framework for William Sitter's "Sons of the Desert" (1934) To say a wild lie that is strikingly counterproductive. Mostly very funny, especially the scene in which Stan was harassed by Delice, resulting in a violent game of pressure and payment. However, some fun was undermined by Oakland and Flowers, where they played their roles perfectly straight, adding an element of hatred to the "chosen husband" scenario. Originally released in the UK as a slippery.
