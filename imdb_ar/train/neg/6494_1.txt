I loved Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in seeing how he would act as a writer / director. I could not have been more disappointed by this move. The film was very disjointed, and the film ended so much that I wanted to pull the plug off the wall. The actors were very good but they were a waste of talent. Not all actors are reduced to being writers or directors, and it is clear that Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the films I've seen in my life in 50 years, this is the worst film ever. Please all of us prefer Mr. Hopkins and stick to the representation you master, and leave writing and guidance to those talented in those areas. If I could give this film a rating of less than one certainly.
