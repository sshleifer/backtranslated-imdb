Maybe I was not the biggest fan of Blair Blair but I appreciate that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the preferences that were thrown into different IMDb comments. "Unique", "smart", "future cult classic" etc. ... you should be amazed at where people come up with these things to describe such a weak effort. <br /> <br /> Because Altered, unfortunately, weak weak film does not participate in any respect. The absurdity is not funny. Horror and dismay is not scary. Whatever aspects of "thinking" some poor colleagues saw in this film were the result of sharp illusions because there is certainly nothing deep or intelligent about this mess. <br /> <br /> Well, so we do not know anything that stands out. Is it at least possible? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately no. For starters, get a very bad representation. You can not say that most of the B films these days are better represented. the plot? Boring and messy. Dialogues? Many amateurs do a better job already. <br /> <br /> It's really a puzzling trend. I did not expect great improvements to the charming Blair but at least small steps forward. Instead, it seems that our manager has worsened over time, completely oblivious to past experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a big disadvantage in Altered, this is the main group. Much of the plot takes place in one place, where the main characters are restricted but Sanchez has failed to give the place any personality at all. Given that in Blair's charming game, the jungle plays a major role - a character (a discount, so to speak) as important as the three students - you think the director will realize that the same thing is needed here. But no ... This place has no character at all due to the slow trend and lack of attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Nothing is fixable here. Hard fans of Blair's Witch die in a better position after Daniel Marek. Although its production is far from being gold, it shows a better structure than Sanchez and some lessons are applied by Blair's witch (unfortunately, in weak but still stories).
