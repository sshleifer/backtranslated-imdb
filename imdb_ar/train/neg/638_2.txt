Good Earth may have been the most boring film I've ever seen. The plot is slow and lacking. Representation is the borderline comedy. While I love Paul Money, I can now say that I saw a film whose justice is not real. The only saving grace I have found in this film is the value of production. The use of hundreds of plugins throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create illusion are millions of wasps readily sold and were revolutionary at the time. Unlike the value of production, I can not say anything good or fun about this film.
