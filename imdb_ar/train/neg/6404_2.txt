Spoilers ... if this thing is possible ..... . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams, I felt it was necessary to buy this film as the first screen appearance. Wow ... I could not imagine a more reasoned film. Basically, the movie takes one bad joke after another that your Uncle Artie will tell you after dinner and affects them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second sitcom. <br /> <br /> I am all for vulgar humor, but this humor was not vulgar, or was misleading ... it was just a mind. There are no advantages to replacing this film, unlike the fanatics of Robin Williams, like me, who simply have to own every movie.
