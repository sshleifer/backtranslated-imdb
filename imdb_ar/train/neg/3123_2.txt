I felt worn out while watching this ... but that seems to be the reason behind the madness that runs the family in this film. This is not very meaningful anyway, as others have said, this was one of Karloff's last films and only his presence on the screen gives him no credibility at all. It is sad that all the great legends of horror films in the Age of Sound have finally turned into a championship in low-grade trash like this. On the marginal side, Boris got a little better than poor old Lugo Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris is doing his best and giving him credit for trying to hold this mess together. Strong background music does not help distract attention from any obvious moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican actors are called an exotic and exciting English monotony similar to the genre used in pornographic films in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I think it is from the home of Edgar Allan Bo, "the home of the intimates" obtained from him but you will be under intense pressure to find a great deal of po in the final article. <br /> <br /> However, there are far better films with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and give them a wide berth, unless you want to curse the "shrinking brain" too!
