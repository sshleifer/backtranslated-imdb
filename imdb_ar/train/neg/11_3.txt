If you look at the Corey Large information here on the IMDb, it is clear that there is a film called "Reloading" in production (as of June 2008) in which a character named Sebastian Cole is playing. <br /> <br /> First, how does this crazy film win a sequel ... And secondly, Sebastian was not killed at the end of the "loader"? <br /> <br /> I watched this in the early hours of the morning when I was fighting insomnia, and so I was wandering around inside and out. I'm sure I missed some of the plot points, but overall, I looked really weak. Large's performance (for me) was one of the strongest parts of the film. I was also surprised by some of the people who commented on the beautiful girls, because I thought the actress who played Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
