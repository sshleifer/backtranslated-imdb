The only reason for rating this movie is 1 is that scratch is not a selection option. With a thinner piece of cabbage soup in the Depression era, appalling representation, and special effects that seem to come out of the television series "Thunderbirds", it is amazing that Widmark did not kill the director to put the black label on his autobiography. Even according to the 1950s standards, the special effects are terrible, except for a few underwater submarine sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects because, with the exception of 20,000 underwater patrols and THEM! , There was no other person doing the effects. Definitely not the Disney competition that year if this was the only competition. I would not recommend the film, even to hardcore submarine enthusiasts, because the most realistic scene on the submarine was confined to a single shot where the sea water could be seen streaming down the high telescope. There are other much better sub-movies you can enjoy from this era, such as 20,000 of the above leagues or Torpedo Run.
