Bear is an idiot, but he realizes it and acts as a result. His life is completely boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend died, Nico. He felt it was completely empty and decided to go out to become drunk. When he returns home, he crashes with a girl placing ads. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and begins to follow them with great concern. Well, the beginning of the film is a bit slow, and may lead to the dullness of most people. Maybe, the best part is 5 minutes of sex (nearly 30 different scenes about it) you can watch them in the middle of the movie; it's not good for sexual excitement, but for For the funny and unexpected scenes, this is probably the best film, neither the actors nor the directors are good, the results are a boring film that can produce a laugh for some people (not me) - the entire film is based on ridiculous (stupid, as the film says) Anything interesting, I love Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe his worst movies!), J Rack to do it better.
