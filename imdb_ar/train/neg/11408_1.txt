This was just plain terrible. I read this book for school, I did all the tests, and I see it so! My teacher and 20 other people forced me to watch it, and it was worse than Leonard's plan, part 6, plan 9 from outer space, and Hudson Hawk. The thing that made this movie terrible was enough reasons to kill yourself. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the representation was terrible. Third, it was quite different from the book. Literally, it was so bad and asked me to excuse. Basically, I would rather see Basic Instinct 2 instead of watching this. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one wants to watch this. It was terrible. terrible!
