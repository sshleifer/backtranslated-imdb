Standard "digitized" monster fare, filled with a set of routine drawing instruments from films of great creatures. It seems as if someone had a bunch of papers with plot ideas from other films written on them, mixed up and dealt with. Whatever lines and characters that appeared in the transaction were thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are intertwined with cliches, so you can play the game "Guess ends as a monster meal" after less than ten minutes in the movie, and you may get each one right - including the order they will devour. Many characters are very hateful, so you can root for the creature to close it. Some of the main characters include: Clone Billy Idol who browses with sharks, grunts loudly checks into finances, Captain Ahab with vengeance, and his girlfriend in Ahab who dances with corruption at the bar. Oh, a big big monster needs to be treated to manage anger. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people argue a lot, beautiful girls running with wet shirts, couples make exotic beaches, explosions happen, ruins of a mausoleum appear, and greasy face pirates fall. <br /> <br /> amusing, for the most part, but there is something that bothered me: the cruelty of characters when other people were killed. After one violent death, they make jokes with individual lines. I almost heard shots divorced. <br /> <br /> In general, well, if you have 90 minutes lost, you want to laugh at a very bad movie. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
