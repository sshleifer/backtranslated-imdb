There is a reason for this direct transition to the video. The story is harmful. Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sexual way in the churches, and other scenes that limit the taste (such as the scene in the laundry room) distort this film. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold is fine - but the film itself with its themes of degradation and revenge is not good. But it is a good movie for trivia competitions - because few people have seen it.
