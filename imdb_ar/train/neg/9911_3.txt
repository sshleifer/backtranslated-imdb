If you have well-liked actors, Peter Falk, Rep Torren, George Segal, and Bill Copps, you will not need Billy Burke, Colio, or any other distractions. The huge talent is completely lost in "Three Days to Vegas", where the script is directly blamed. My current vacation films are as interesting as this misleading road movie. If you want to see how to use veteran actor with a good script, check out "Crew". There are no replacement factors here, watching these wonderful actors who struggle with such vulnerable substances is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow text deceives the public, by not giving representatives anything to work with. - Merck
