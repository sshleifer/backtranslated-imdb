This film should be shown to film school students as an example of what should not be done. The original hit some of the main tire butt, this terrible disaster breaks the basic rule of Bruckheimer films, namely: we all know they suck, but have wonderful actions. This film has no work. This movie is boring. Where are cars? Where are the chases? Where is the tension? Where is the thrill? Where is the rush? Where!!?? This is not a film at all, it's a bad announcement. 50 cars in 24 hours? its wrong. They have 3 days to steal them, wrong advertising. How bad is this? Lead acting cruel, wooden and forced. The villain, the policeman, the others ... who cares. They utter their meaningless lines, and they serve the irrational plot. "Do not worry, we'll make a lot of quick cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is" or "We'll fix it out loud" The script is not really a text, it's like a list Of clich√©s by the end represent a sum of: ------- Warning - possible spoiler ------ 5 ------ 4 ----- 3 ----- 2 ----- 1 The biggest felony at all is the misuse of Vinnie Johnny, the man ... This is the saddest, coolest mofo since Jules in the heart of fiction ... and what they do !? They make him muted barely in the movie! The main one was able to save the movie It is possible to be very stupid ... what? Why? Why? The original film is very fun with a fantastic trick in the end that makes the driver away.The original has a 40 minute great chase delivers the original go or find out some of the real car chase activities, RUNIN and Cage had all the money, all those resources, and all that experience, and could not even get close to matching a 25-year-old film for $ 250,000 $? How could it be? Feel that you have separated after seeing this movie. Where I was previously excited to see an ugly wolf, remember Titans and Pearl Harbor, and now I say: God helps us all. <br /> <br />
