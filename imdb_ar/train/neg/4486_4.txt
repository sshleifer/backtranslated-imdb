What the hell was it all about? I saw the matrix and was amazed. It was the most exciting movie ever. What was owned by brothers and Ashkovsky to do this film is something outside me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can not argue with it. Basically, this whole movie was a burden of speech, and I'm not mistaken, I have no problem with the resonant movies, but everything in The Matrix Reloaded was a meaningless burden of drivvle. After that, there will be a long-running fighting sequence, then a useless command group, then another long-term fighting scene, and everything accumulates up to the greatest resistance ever. Talking a little barked block speaks of an incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves also has the worst performance yet. I knew he was not a good actor, but this was just a joke. If you watch his movies the way he was, things will look worse as they progress. God knows how to perform in Gotta give something! Keanu Reeves: The only board of wood that has ever been represented. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, this has become a great disappointment. If you have not seen the first movie before, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time with this absolute heap of feces. <br /> <br />
