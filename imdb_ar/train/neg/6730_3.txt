This is a film about how men think about thinking about love. There is no woman describing sexual confrontation that lasted one night and declares it to be a love story. <br /> <br /> Among the ten monologues I felt that only three of them really had any kind of truth. I kept waiting for the movie to get better, and I did a bit, but was not the best enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I wanted it to be good, but it never worked. Maybe if they were actually love stories he would have succeeded.
