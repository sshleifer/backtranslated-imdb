I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a good horror film when the US military found the body of a terrorist with a stolen chemical. The body was cremated and the virus was released into the air on a small island. The injured local population soon turns into a hungry zombie, and a group of soldiers have to leave to cooperate with a group of tourists and ride in an abandoned hotel as they try to fight the living dead. I did not find this film as good as the original film "Zombie Flesh Eaters". But it was still a good horror film with some good work. I did not think it was one of the best in the chain. 10/04
