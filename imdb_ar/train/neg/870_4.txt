Near the end of this excitement, the stunning last day image of Ally Sheedy is used creatively to form more of a sinister image. She convinces one person that if the bad house of Davis is on her way, she can do it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see this. If you wonder about Sheedy's shape in a pair of old glasses (but why should anyone?) Here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's crazy, sex-hungry woman is too tired. Even if you love this kind of thing more than you do, you'll have to admit that the tension is deteriorating badly during these scenes. Savage Savage's savage brutality of the insurance agent is equally tragic but at least a small role. Among the key actors, Nicholas Walker has no empathy for Paul Keller's plight and his wooden representation. Dara TomanoviÄ‡ is the best and while watching it with Chedy rises a bit. Sheedy's meticulous and small performance (although she often looks in an automatic pilot) is impressive in itself but out of context with the rest. Bad kits, camera action is not featured.
