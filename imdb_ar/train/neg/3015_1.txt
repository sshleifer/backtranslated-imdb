This is a bad film. Not one of those funny bad ones either. This is bad bad. It was very painful to watch. The direction was awful, so there were plenty of hops and green and yellow colors used throughout the film to make the characters look sick. Kira Knightley was not as convincing as a tough chick at all, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and it was acting like fingernails on the blackboard. If you do not see it, do not. You do not miss anything and will not lose your watch except watch your watch from this command. I've seen bad movies before and enjoyed them because of their flaws. This is just a waste of time.
