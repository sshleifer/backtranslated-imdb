Have you ever wondered why the Pacific Islanders automatically appear to have a sense of humor among black Americans? Regardless of their ethnic origins? Well, this film will not provide any answers to this question, which is often postponed - but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> Since its inception, the film has been an "old school" for Pacific Islanders in New Zealand, prompting the question of exactly what the purpose of this task is. Is it intended to perpetuate the established stereotypes of New Zealanders in the Pacific Islands? Or is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes without a soul, and the result is predictable. This film did nothing for New Zealand cinema, because it is just a dedicated romantic comedy devoid of any advantage.
