Another wonderful film for Costa Braves. It is a remarkable presentation of the situation, Latin America and American participation in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but the fact that the United States was deeply involved in coups and support Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the spirit of the film follows the left / communist model propaganda Cold War era. Costa Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, the actions of the United States are brutal and inhuman, while extreme activities in Tobamirus are positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States was engaged. Europe is filled with poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of Uruguayan girls or poor girls parrot themselves as they do in most Eastern European countries. The United States was waging a dirty war and God bless us defeated every monster of Soviet communism. It is unfortunate that the United States had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not a perfect world as the Costa Gaffras and Matamoros love the belief. If Matamoros took power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In the whole film, the left-wing, corrupt and bankrupt ideology of the past ages is trying to consider it ideal and moral.
