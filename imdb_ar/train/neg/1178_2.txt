The film "period" is completely ridiculous is only a high pretext for filming the broad and formal heroine case with the "monster", a monster is supposed to appear every year to rape some women. That's what he does to a great extent, and filming the monster is really horrific; it's basically a tall man wearing a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube that is hard on copious amounts of white liquid. For fake animal porn lovers, I think this is the real turn. However, I was satisfied with the open shots of horses having sex in a public field.
