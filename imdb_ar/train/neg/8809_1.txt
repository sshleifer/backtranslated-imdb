A handful of women who can not move sit and talk and become smoke. They have another woman in a wheelchair who is hiding it because it is distorted and sometimes kills someone to feed this person a human body that is really like some pork bought from the store and wore his clothes by sticking to some plastic fingers. We do not see them killing anybody. Suddenly there is a body on the ground, covered with a bloody sheet. I can not eat spam coverage by paper because of this. Just think of covering junk mail through enough paper to induce the same narcolepsy caused by trying to get all this movie. From time to time, scenes are randomly assigned to a man who "stalks" them by torturing a person who was tied to a chair and is downstairs. The reason for the arrest of this man and how to contact the Sit-On-The-Couch sisters is not explained. There are also scenes of some "supernatural" man who scares. He explains the blood and punches across the wall, but who or what is wrong with him is not explained or even linked to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to see some boring people talking in a deep way about anything while sitting, eating pork and smoking, then there are 90 minutes of that, because except for a scene where one of the freaks is installed on a street corner and the above scenes are random, nothing happens at all . (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them move some things, including the mutilated sister, when they move to their new apartment. It's one of the few times they do not sit on a couch or lie on the bed.
