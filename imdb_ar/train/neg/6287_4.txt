I read about this film in a magazine and I was fascinated. A woman sees one day driving in her own car. Well, I think this may be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... But it is not. First, the title. broke down? Broken ... What? What is a break? And ... oh, wait ... I get it, the title itself is "broken"! Wow, clever! Unfortunately, this is the only thing that happens for it. <br /> <br /> The premise is not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland was much better at "mirrors". The intersection between the invasion of body snatchers and mirrors, fairly modest in it. The most appropriate title would be "boring", because it draws every scene for bloody ages. Or perhaps "confused" because it does not explain anything at all, nor in the narration nor in the story itself, only some vague ideas about the sinister versions and to some extent, spread by horror and cheap scenes used to death, but nothing concrete. It just crashed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the effects and special effects are very good, but again, it is not difficult to act. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I'm still feeling dissatisfied, maybe a bit confused, not in EA Poe or Stephen King's way. Do yourself a favor and do not see this one. Simply put, there are better thriller movies out there.
