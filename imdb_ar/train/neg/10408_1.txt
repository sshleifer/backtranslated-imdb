If Fassbinder made a worse film, I certainly do not want to see it! Anybody who complains that his films are too talkative and anxious to see this must be forced to learn how to appreciate the extra style he has chosen in excellent films such as "The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant". This film is filled with many semi-symbolic images that seem to be a parody of a "technical film." The scene in the abattoirs and the scene of the ten-minute-long Elvira channel seems to be just two of the most blatant examples of what makes this film a real test for the viewer. But what really inspired Hafizi is the few scenes that highlight Elvira, her ex-wife and / or her daughter. These are the only moments that show any real human feelings, and prove that at the heart of this terrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free itself. O wasteful.
