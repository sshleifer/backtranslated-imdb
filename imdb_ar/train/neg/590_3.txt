I was sadly disappointed by this film because of the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films too weak in horror. The main idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not really capable of provoking, intimidating, or shocking - there was one part of the whole film that I thought was horrible but even that did not recover it. I liked the character of Kate at the end of the film, where she seemed to enjoy and become more realistic in the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not necessary for this film and I believe that the director / writer has been hidden with countless characters used without purpose, if he left on the basic characters Making it a solo effort on the part of Kate, it may be successful - Jeremy's representation was mildly frank and I felt uncomfortable viewing poorly on screen chemistry - or lack thereof. what a shame. disappointing.
