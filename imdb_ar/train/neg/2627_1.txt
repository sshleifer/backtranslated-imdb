This bomb is only "burst" one by one, without humor and ridiculous positions only. Really, fireworks to the extreme. Truth is not one of the strengths. I give it 1 out of 10. I would make it zero but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need to get the money. I still retract that tim Burton on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that it was Turkey. But if it is Turkey, this film will not even be a blizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me my money". You can bet if I can. But this is the problem with premium services, subscription variety.
