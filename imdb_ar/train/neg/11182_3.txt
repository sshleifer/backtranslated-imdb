Very fucking film, full of stupid single liners and Jewish references through. It was a serious film but can not be taken seriously. A familiar movie plot ... being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An awful sub-plot, including Kim Basinger. Very robotic and very reggae. I have noticed that the Pacino's acting abilities seem to be declining. The Troubleshooter has problems with, but nothing more disturbing than the Atlanta Pacinos dreadful tone. Damage control needs to fix this damage to the film. Well, my linings are bad, but they are not as bad as those in this movie. This film can not only be boring, but it also erupts. The movie is usually disgusting for the wrong reasons. This movie is inaccessible. I managed to sit through this. The plot, if written a bit better, with perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the terrible sub-schema, and even stupid jokes, it was possible to pull this thrilling story out of recession. What we have left is a dull and silly film making sure it was drilled in our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. An embarrassment to all the good Jewish people everywhere.
