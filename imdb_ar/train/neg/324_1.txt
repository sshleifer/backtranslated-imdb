The worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I picked up this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought "hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laugh" I was wrong, totally wrong. In the middle of the film, all my three friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst scheme, worst text, worst film I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against the wall for an hour, then stopped, and you know why? Because he felt good damn. When I hit my head, I hung this dreaded movie in the microwave and watched it burn ... It was better than anything else I did. It took American Psychic, Army of Darkness, and Bill Kill just to get that crap. I hate you actually sander during this and destroy the whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
