After 5 minutes of this film, I was suffering from hyperpnea, vibration and pain. Not in a good way. The story revolves around a group of idiots who make phone calls with a psychologist and are always a good idea. It turns out that the Husseini do not like the prank phone calls because within two minutes of approaching their home Williams kills the poor mom and dad. Well skip 15 years and guess what? Still a phone prank calls people. Yes you think that terrible killing would prevent them from doing it again but not. After about two hours and after much screaming screams, I realized that this film had only given me the terrible taste in my mouth and the intense need to take my own life. This piece of nonsense does not even deserve to laugh at poor production, or "acting", or a rattler hates his declining career. I love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfactory piece I have ever seen. just no.
