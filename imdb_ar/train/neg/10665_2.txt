After about three minutes of this thing, I began to reorient quickly, pausing only during nudity (why do bad films always include those women who look good?). Within ten minutes, I finished, and I hope to get my money back from the rental shop. People who write these films must be punished by the MPAA. Come on book - the bad guys are always in the car with the bomb activated by remote control for the good guy! This is how it has been since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to further insult the injuries, the "twisting" was in the end very similar, so that it could have come from any film written in the last 25 years. Bert Reynolds was good, but he has to focus on real films. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - run away! Run away!
