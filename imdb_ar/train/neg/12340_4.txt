"Transylvania 6-5000" is a terrible parody in the mid-eighties of the last century, but it is funny and charming with some well-known names in the crew and a handful of real opportunities for chanting in the text. Reporters from Bozo in the newspaper "Gloppy Gloppy Gloppy Gossipy Tabloid", largely against their will, were sent to Transylvania to make a story about the return of the crazy scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little tricks and details to discover left and right in the film, such as a small guillotine for boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are used to put cream and sugar on the breakfast table. However, the whole film is not as successful as possible, but it was supposed to be successful, where jokes and satirical attitudes have become very long. The production of Roger Kurman "Transylvania Twist", released four years after this, is more entertaining and more recommended. The film makes fun of classic world sights in the early 1930s, so it's best to make sure you've seen those things if you want to understand all the little gags and references. There is a beautiful original twist that indicates that Frankenstein's character acts only like a mad scientist when he enters his laboratory. He also revealed that he was actually more of a kind of Damian father than Christ who cared only about the state of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the terrible man who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, plays the role of psychic servants who appear and disappear in the most inappropriate moments. I am sure that the character of John Tortoro in "Mr. Didds" was inspired by the role of Richards here.
