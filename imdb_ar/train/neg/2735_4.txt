I thought it was not the best episode I had seen every time I saw it (although my partner in the watch handed me a napkin in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * sigh *). It was good to see Cox outside the fragile "quixism case" that never stops, which these days, albeit only for short moments. I also enjoyed trying to put the rings included in the length of the character (or height, in the case of JD) and young episodes first. I can also see how Zack can be well on his way to Chevy Chase / or Matthew Perry? Prat-induced chemical slide fall (already recognized on Conan). Small side note, the song (now hanging in my head) was from the montage caused by the dance of the "dinner" porters of Martin Sexton.
