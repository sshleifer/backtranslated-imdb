Some may make fun of it, but there is actually a real art with a very bad film industry. This is missing on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A handful of young people - women wearing breasts and shirts that are constantly wet - naturally go to film "Surf the Blood" and end up with 31 crocodiles. <br /> <br /> The crocodile was not only clearly fake, but some props [notice the boat that collides with the reef in particular] seem to have come out of the Thunderbird! <br /> <br /> Not good, from start to finish. Do not see it!
