Camera angles that do not help the movie: Extremely long angles only where you can feel most of the time that the bottom half of the movie is missing (the screen is broken), because there seem to be important actions underway, but you can not see them.

I deal with deep and slow films. But this person is trying hard to be something shrewd and painful in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Nothing should be associated with any of the characters, because it does not work well enough.
