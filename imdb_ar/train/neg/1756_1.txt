On the back burner for years (until it was reported) this television reunion began for two of the most beloved characters in the history of the sitcom badly - and went straight from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her friend Roda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long period of isolation and tracking on each other's lives. What a new concept! But, sadly, there is something worth talking about (let alone making a film) that happened to either of them in the intervening years. Instead, the script contains the throw of an old conspiracy machine after the other (mostly about older women in the workplace), while the magic and strange evolution that made the original program the winner is missing. Instantly forgetting forgetting supports forgetfulness, humor does not exist, chemistry that Moore and Moore Harper have disappeared together. Moore allegedly stopped this project for years, waiting for the "correct text" before committing it. If this is the person who is considered to be "true," what are the things you have rejected on earth? It is not the age of characters that happens (as time goes on), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. At one point, the aim of this experiment was, but it clearly failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, among potential audiences. He forgot quickly and mercilessly, and the film is a farce and an insult to classical.
