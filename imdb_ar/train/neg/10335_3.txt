Average (and amazingly astounding) Fulci giallo which means it is still very bad according to normal standards, but was replaced by its strong accumulation and some nice touches like a wonderful time touch on vision issues and foresight. <br /> <br /> The known weaknesses of this type are in full alert: normal dialogue, wooden representation, illogical plot points. The conclusion continues for a very long time, while the eviction proves to be somewhat lame or I will say: an emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Folsi's cynical treatment of Giallo is fun. Yellow clues wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 killers lame
