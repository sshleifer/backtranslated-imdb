This film is a disgrace to the main League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not even believe they threw Cleveland. (Yes, I realized at that time that the real Indians were very good, and the twins had their spot on the bottom of the American league, but I'm still fixed). Looking forward to the third, when the Indians finally go to the series. You can not tell me that this was not the plan after the second film was completed. what happened? Anyway, if you have a genuine fan of the original main league do yourself a favor and do not see this junk.
