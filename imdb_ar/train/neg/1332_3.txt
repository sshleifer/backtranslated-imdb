The freshness of hearing Jay Leno's clean four-letter voice is the only unforgettable part of this equal leader of the police. In COLLISION COURSE, the slow-faced comedian collaborates with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen primary turbocharger (I think Lino, the car lover, played a part in the plot?). The two try their best, but they do, but Lino is not represented, and Morita's routine for fish outside the sea is in a hurry. The film has little to do with the 1980s, but its worthiest moments are increasingly rare as it fills 100 minutes of play time. Lino's great talent lovers will feel satisfied; everyone will just be bored.
