I would classify this film as minus 10 but unfortunately it was not presented. <br /> <br /> Why did not I go out in the first five minutes of this film I can not say. I had to go with my instinct and leave immediately !! Many people have done in our theater, and unfortunately I have not followed them. <br /> <br /> The story lacked all the criteria of the film. No plot. Horrible representation! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I might not see another film in it. There was not a single relationship in the story beyond talking about the reception. I love the tazer scene. It is very bad that he did not shock some of the flesh in the halo of the plot. Someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this movie!
