The Cypher is a cheap, derivative and boring film, located in a futuristic, poorly investigated future, with wooden yarns and a laughable end. <br /> <br /> A strange feeling that something interesting may be about to happen makes you see a series of increasingly absurd and unconvincing events before the filmmakers in your face applaud the end of a combination of the worst Bond events with a Duran Duran video . <br /> <br /> It is painfully clear that they acquired production using the improvised Dr Who style to include a few pieces of CGI (if Babylon 5) good.
