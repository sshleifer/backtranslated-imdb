The film lacks credibility with helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman will do what was done here, even women before the women's movement in the sixties and seventies. The only part of the film you can believe is that Germany wants to know where the landing is. Ignore for a moment that the British have taken over all the spies but even if they do not, they will not let anyone roam like this to reassure the Germans that the landing will be in Calais. Not the main thing that makes the movie not working. It is the culmination of all the wrong things that make the film fail. Meet all of the bad output, bad scripts, no attempt to authenticate (at all) to make the movie fall. In general, spies must fade into woodwork. The thrill comes with a spy wondering whether the information they have is correct or not and worries about being discovered. This game was over from the start. This spy was doing nothing but spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and instill some excitement may be in reading the book.
