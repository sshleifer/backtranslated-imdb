I saw most of the RMFTM episodes when I was a teenager at the "Cliffhanger Theater" which was running after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater started in it in the early 1990s. The time was not nice. <br /> <br /> I can definitely offer a special effects allowance, which was very impressive in a low budget series 50 (IMO Commando Cody was better than George Reeves / Superman on his TV show). I can also make allowance for the world, "acting", and fight the design of dances -. Except for the man who plays ruler of the moon men. It is an unreasonable mistake. He acts and acts like a colleague who comes to fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of a strange race. Even flexible dialogue works well - everyone shakes their lines like fireworks chains, without wasting time or pausing for things like "thought" or "meditation." Because everyone does it, the viewer finds it fascinating in a moment, and even for my modern feelings, it does not bother you much. <br /> <br /> What really infuriates me is writing and planning. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the moon, preparing soda-powered rocket ships, or flying suit with "up / down" and "fast / slow" controls. I am not bothered even by the centuries of decisions that were directed to Clavnigers which ends every chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are stupid from fence jobs and do not have a cumulative memory. The fact is that although the dialog box is similar to a fast train, the plot goes through the same suggestions over and over again. <br /> <br /> Digged: Commando Cody and his colleague are spearheads in a secret high-tech science lab charged with protecting the Earth (or at least the United States) against a foreign invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys are walking on the right and they are taking the foolishness of Cody and his staff ... not once (perhaps understandable) but at many times. They even kidnap his female assistant on the second try. And they do not get any intelligence. To prove my point further, let me explain how Cody jumps into the flight suit and flies around in trouble and does not seem to have succeeded in attracting anyone. Do this again and again. Cody also flies his ship to the moon (the woman comes to cook), stays for about 30 seconds, turns around and returns. Cody picks up one of the Atomic Ray rifles ... and immediately loses them again to the bad guys because he can not be bothered to close them. And so forth. <br /> <br /> You think that if Cody's efforts are vital to save the United States from Moon men, he might ask a number of soldiers to use carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of just working with the local police in each time. It was supposed to be a military operation, but it behaves like another episode of "Gangbusters." <br /> <br /> Everything is difficult in the stomach. I appreciate that the creators were severely restricted in the scope of their story because of budget and time constraints ... I appreciate that Cody is in fact somewhat tough and tough (although he loses half of his first fights). But I can not help shouting "Door! Lock the door !!" When gangsters simply go to his lab, try to blow up the ship, there are no security measures at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> However, it's okay. Of the three trophies I saw, Phantoms Crips had a better plot, and the Submerged Kingdom was more airborne (Haha!) And better than Radar Minnes, but it was a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> BTW ... Why Men "Radar"? They did not use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Should not the title be "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
