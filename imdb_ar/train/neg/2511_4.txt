Directed by director Fred Chippessie (Roxanne), this bona fide intention, but the low comedy about Albert Einstein (Matau) trying to link his daughter-in-law (Ryan) with the ordinary man Tim Robbins in order to induce her to relax and enjoy life in the fifties. To make Ryan love Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a wonderful world. The idea is appealing, but the film stands in front of intimate situations and absurd dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the songs of the brilliant support team do their best to keep this ridiculous comedy on its feet, but they are unable to save the film. It is unfortunate that so many talents went to produce such a flimsy film. I would not recommend anyone unless you are a huge fan of Ryan Maj.
