Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for everyone including the audience. The lightness of the wrong identity of the old hat and the lines of the scandal plot can be forgiven. Very few people have seen these films about their designs. But, they usually have some interesting secondary characters that are involved in sub-schemas - not here. They usually had interesting dances, breathtaking dancing, and attractive songs. Not happy going beautiful. As a female lead singer, the whole movie was played as a second banana that was desperately looking for a star to play - instead she was invited to the film and could not do it. Lost Scottish language. Scottish freak is usually absent automatically everywhere. It was a picnic for pedestrians. The musical numbers were pedestrians. Cesar Romero presents his usual professional performance, painting the scene where no one else has played, in the type of role of the product often written by Walter Abel and Adolf Minju. David Neven is fine, and no one can do David Neven like David Neven. At the end of the day, if you adore Niven as I do, then this is enough reason to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip that.
