Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people who leave positive comments about this film must get royalties. This is a terrible film in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no humor making a slasher / comedy video. They will receive D for this purpose. College students will receive a "F" certificate or be asked to leave school. Since this monster was done by "Professionals", I think there should be time in jail or at least for the cinema under surveillance. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space," but that does not fall into this category. Script, representation, sound, and routing are so bad that they are almost inaccessible. If you enjoy watching bad movies that entertained Ed Wood or Blaxploitation or horror movies in the seventies. After watching this, you feel that you have lost an hour and a half of your life.
