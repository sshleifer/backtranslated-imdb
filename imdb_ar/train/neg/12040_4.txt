I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of that story. However, as an independent film I found this very boring. The battle scenes tried to be great and wonderful, but they were just plain CGI. <br /> <br /> Representation is bad Brad Pitt was chosen only to attract ladies. But he does not make a good fighter, I'm very scared. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This film does not look good with landscapes and castles of impressive buildings / walls. I like the film trying to at least recognize the accents of the characters but it seems that this film completely ignores. We hear nothing about American and Scottish English, but what you might expect in a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this film to a family sitting down. It is too long and young people will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it is okay if you are not interested in lack of realism.
