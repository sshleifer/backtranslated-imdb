I'm a fan of horror, and zombies are my favorite. However, Zombi 3 is considered one of the worst absolute films I have ever seen. Needless to say I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "The Return of the Living Dead," but while the film was intentionally funny, the film is the opposite. She has some of the most laughable things I've ever seen in my life, especially the main scientific personality. He was watching with General Hesteri only. Also, the effects are subprime and in many cases they are dirty, and often death scenes are just stupid. This, of course, makes it more fun. The worst spoiler - the worst is the scene where the man opens the door of the refrigerator and sees the cropped zombie head, which opens his eyes and then flies in one way or another from the flies (obviously pulled out incorrectly with a few threads) neck, killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies every known physical law of man, one of the most ridiculous things ever filmed. This is just one of the many awkward moments in the stupid chaos. I can not believe he got a high rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do it yourself and rent this sucker.
