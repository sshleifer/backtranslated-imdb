The Sons of Good in the Webster Dictionary of Lugophobia defines "fear of words." I might just be logophobic. Since there is no combination of words that frightens me more than at the beginning of the film, the credits contain the words "Produce, write and output:", followed by the name of one individual. think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but very few of all trades. Even the most veteran filmmakers like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely control their films. But I was there, all in my seat in the theater, popcorn in my hand and about to watch The Order when I was thrown in my face like Nolan Ryan's fast ball, "produced, written and directed by Brian Helgland." Stop! <br /> <br /> Since I'm a movie fan, I knew Brian Hellland. As a writer, his filmmaker will be filmed over the last 10 years, such as the share price of dotcom in 1998. There were many theater-like anthems (Assassins, The Postman, The Conspiracy Theory), where there were critical successes and awards (LA Confidential , Mystic) River. They seem to be taking turns? One good, very bad, knowing that his last film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's life, I took a breath and I hope for the best. When I go back, I should not have exhaled. <br /> <br /> The Order stars Heath Ledger (the tale of the Knights of Helgeland), such as Alex Bernier, a priest in the Order known as the Carolingians, who was summoned to Rome when a fellow priest was killed in circumstances where the Arch Archbishop Foscula was killed. In a meeting with Father Thomas (also of the rank and playfully Mark Laddy), they began to compile the puzzles they left behind in the wake of the sudden death of the chaplain. <br /> <br /> The complexity of things is a sub-plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shaneen Samson) who fled an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during the expulsion of evil spirits. Alex has feelings for Mara and for an unknown reason for the public, traveling to Rome together. <br /> <br /> Nari goes through a good night's sleep and faces William Eden (Pino Foreman) Alex for centuries eats eater. The eater of the sins, as we are told, are those who eat the sins of an individual who dies when the church does not, allowing access to heaven. William is fed up with the life of healing and is looking for Alex to take over his role and liberate him from his mundane duties. Alex hesitates, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex turns to the ritual of the Savior will save and complete transformation. Alex then searches for answers to his many inquiries, while Father Thomas reveals the Vatican's plot to transfer power to his interrogator colleague. <br /> <br /> The arrangement is not a terrible film, but it is very boring. There were silly special effects and nothing to do with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - the scene of Alex in the dead Mara - is pale and gentle and leaves us no emotional response to the plight of the couple. Everyone seems to be talking so quietly and without violence that flat lines of salts and odors can be managed to prevent me from trying to get a quick nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland, I beg you not to try it again. Share your vision with others and allow those most experienced to help guide you in directions that are not narrow-minded and self-serving. Until then, nothing shows that he is capable of anything more than a failing degree. 2 star hotels. <br /> <br />
