LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing film. I've seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this one really makes you feel disappointed. ......... <br /> <br /> This movie really wastes your time and money. I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release, hit both in the cinema hall .......................... ...... ...................... <br /> <br /> CIRCUIT's role was too small to use this film. I think SANJAY-DUTT played down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The movie character is also not well defined Like the previous film. This film is shown as a result of excessive trust ... ... <br /> <br /> The thoughts of MAHATMA are not specific and confusing ............. br /> <br /> Too much disappointment
