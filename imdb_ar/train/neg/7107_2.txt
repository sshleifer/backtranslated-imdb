I'm sure there's a kind of IMDB cult that you like movies that mocked the MST3K. After seeing both this and the "doorman" and reading dozens of comments about their importance, I became convinced that there was some conspiracy here. Many people say that people who hate it are "just afraid of nonsense" or "do not know good horror" or things like that. Well, I do not really care about humor, but I want something to happen in a movie! Most of them just a wife sitting and looking around you! Or walk around the house / garden! The film requires something to give atmospheere, you do not get it just by useless scenes and there was someone walking around staring. Oh, and "makes you think"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> p. For the record, I am a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of thing.
