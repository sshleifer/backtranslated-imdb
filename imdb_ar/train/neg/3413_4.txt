First Watch 12/26/2008 - (Eugene Levi's Abbey): The comic murder mystery of Cornie with very few laughs. The film appears to be based on a former Italian film by accreditations, but it has been rewritten by two well-known romantic comedians. But Charles Shire and Nancy Myers did not cut it apart from their other efforts. The story revolves around a traveling couple of Americans, including Richard Lewis and Shawn Young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to earn a fortune from the rewards after seeing a newspaper announcement about the return of the Deshind. When they try to get him back they see a hand coming out of the garage door in the lady's house they think is connected to the rest of the woman's body that is supposed to give them money. They are afraid, instead of calling the police and telling them the truth they are making, like fleeing from the scene and expecting to frame them for murder. The other characters in the movie are recognized in a train before that and wander around the gambling resort in Monte Carlo doing many things to be brought to the story. Other members of the Group of Representatives include representatives of John Candy, James Bluche, Sibel Shepard, George Hamilton and others. After knowing the police to die, they start questioning the main characters, and of course, they have to work through their hideous lies to find out what actually happened. None of the representatives of the above-mentioned personalities can come out of this humble film despite some of the ridiculous moments often offered by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a terrible film, it's not good. There are plenty of regular movies, this is just another film for the stack. Try it, maybe you'll like it, maybe you will not.
