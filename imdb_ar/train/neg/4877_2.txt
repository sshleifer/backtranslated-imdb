Frank Capra's creative work must have taken place at the time of this film. Although she has some charming moments and many wonderful artists, the direct recycling of Capra is not only for the texts but for the big shots of his first novel of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is raucous. It is understood that he will reuse footage of horse racing, which is impressive. But he uses the scenes of an entire dialogue with junior actors, then returns those actors and expects us not to note, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years old! Unless you want to watch one of the latest appearances of Oliver Hardy, skip this and watch Broadway Bill instead.
