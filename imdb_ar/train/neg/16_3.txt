There are a lot of people who look very good in this film. Maybe that's the best thing about it. This may make it worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalf), a young man about to make his mark on the world. He is the son of a famous family with a good reputation and is on his way to law school. But like so many of these settings, things are not quite as perfect as they appear. Expectations in this family far outweigh love. Except for the school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of a previous traumatic event that shook the family, which was partially revealed through memories of the past but not fully articulated. The disturbing Tristan environment makes him lose his best ways at the earliest opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows the return of some strippers to a beachfront party. From there, Tristan endorses Sebastian Cole (Corey Larg), who drives him to a drug-dealing fugitive. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a weak script and a story that is not very attractive. There are also some camera tricks that seem generally annoying and inappropriate, such as slow motion, fast motion, freezing frames and echoes. These are the kinds of effects the director might normally use to show a person's perspective while taking drugs, except in this case, they seem to have been sporadically thrown at random points, in some cheap attempts at style. <br /> <br /> Despite its relatively unknown performance, the performances were good everywhere, especially with regard to the Corey Large. I think we will see at least two of these people in bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when mentioning actors, I must mention their appearance. Rating ratings Based on high temperature, these films reach 11 degrees. The women in this film have a striking appearance and distract you from a boring, watching movie. I'm sure male characters are very attractive, but you have to ask someone else to comment on that. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this movie, not to buy or lease, or even see for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort.
