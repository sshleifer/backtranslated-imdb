I will keep reviewing this program as short as possible. skip it. Budget is low, not funny, script is lousy. Acting is not as bad as writing, but still bad. This is all you need to know, but I will continue to write too much. <br /> <br /> This is a three-track movie, each of which makes fun of another. The most entertaining film with this idea is exactly "The Movie", with George S. Very vague, but worth searching. MM satirical movies from the 1930's and did so with elegance, precision and dry wit. <br /> <br /> This movie did not. It's a parody of three kinds of films, supposed to date back to the late 1970s, early 1980s, just a parody of films I've never heard before. The first is, I think, a parody of "Kramer vs. Kramer" in some way. Peter Reigert does his best with a poor cinematic line. The second is a parody, of, I do not know what ... Daniel Steele's novel? I mean, you might see a story like this on Lifetime TV, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember the 1970s, I was there. This opera-style parody of a young woman brings her way to power. This kind of stuff usually makes fun of itself, so I do not see how this was necessary. <br /> <br /> We are on a somewhat easier ground with the third part, "The Municipalities", which makes fun of cop films. I referred to "The New Centurians" and some "Dirty Harry", both about 10 years old when the film was created. Yes, nice and current. Robbie Benson plays the perfect young rookie (a coward over his head) while Richard Wiedmark plays the veteran police officer who drinks whiskey while sitting in a police car (OH! STOP! SIDE! He's drinking wine in the police car! How not!) Note that this was the first The film "Animal House" is named "National Lampoon". Wonderful. The transition of five years from this classic to this manure pile is no less than a shock. I can go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most sophisticated and original sounds in American humor (which will be National Lampoon, the original magazine for about 10 years or so) to sell and start a long and slow slide into a world of waste. Long and only exists as a commercial name to shoot low-cost "comedy" movies for a fee. Another reason to absorb capitalism (and cocaine) very badly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a very enjoyable time. Do not waste 90 minutes. I want to return to me. On the plus side, Fred Willard is in it!
