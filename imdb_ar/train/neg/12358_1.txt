Demi Moore's character was selected in the film for seals because of her appearance. That was a bad start and the movie fell from there. The plot was absolutely incredible. The will to make it into a difficult military unit is not enough. This film did not convince me of the physical ability of women to perform the kinds of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Attempting to pretend that women and men are essentially the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. Gender differences are what make life enjoyable.
