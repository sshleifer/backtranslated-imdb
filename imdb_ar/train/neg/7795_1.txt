First, I'm not really impressed with the whole "stuff that eats meat in disgusting new ways" of the genre, but I'm a fan of bad movies, so my neighbor neighbor said he had the worst film ever. This. So we start watching it. First of all - it is recorded on a video camera without a tripod! Second, the voice of a thin white man called a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogue is logical. Fourthly, the scenes of the zombie, though not convincing and heated by bad make-up and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and neighbor next door) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes but it's fast. It is very amateurish like watching an annual school video book badly dubbed ... with zombie. Note to anyone involved in this movie - I want 20 minutes of my life to watch this, before I fall asleep, I come back.
