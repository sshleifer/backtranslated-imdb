There is another adventure in the world of anomalous comedy, which is located on a campus that includes the nerd's quest for coolness, and how to extract the triple extortion from the popular CD players to make it get the girl. It's been done before, and it's been done in a very satisfactory way. The overall humor that has made teens such as "American Pie" and "Dude Where My Car" is very common outside of the context in this installment, which is so random that the viewer can not frown or reject it, is taken out. The film is poorly written, and the actors never succeed in making any of the film a little likely. I will not honor this terrible image by revealing it, because it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers are never able to enjoy or incite laughter, which at worst is very bad and at times unreachable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who was impressed by his first appearance, was humiliated by himself in this picture and wondered how a career in the toilet could end so quickly. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
