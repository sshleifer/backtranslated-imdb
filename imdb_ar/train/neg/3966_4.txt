Admittedly, I'm not a connoisseur of my partner, but I put it well, the smart flick deserves time. My quirks, in short: <br /> <br /> - The dialog box is often weak and sometimes unbelievable of a particular character. <br /> <br /> - The unconvincing representation. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never blames. <br /> <br /> The book picked up bits of choice from half a dozen mainstream movies, tossed into a kettle, did not dry enough and tried to feed us poor with the resulting chaos, al'dente. <br /> <br /> Long and short, although it is not terrible at all, it certainly is not worth accommodating one of my NetFlix rentals.
