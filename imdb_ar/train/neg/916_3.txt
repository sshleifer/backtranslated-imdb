Lauren Bacall and Charles Boer do not give the right chemistry here in 1945. <br /> <br /> There is a good story here about the axis that is trying to get coal for use in the next war. Unfortunately, this part of the story has not been confirmed. Instead, we are dealing with the supposed Bauer company. By the way, Bakal Britain is like Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning actor Katina Paxino is famous. As with the unforgettable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, "To whom the bell costs", Paxino plays again a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double cross spy of Franco's group. She is an evil character here, especially when she is throwing a 14-year-old boy out the window. She believed that Pu'er gave the child an important material to hide.
