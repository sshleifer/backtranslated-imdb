The maiden voyage is just that. I would like to say right away that I watched 5 minutes of this before I can not stand anymore. As mentioned earlier in another comment, this film is not all about "very bad it's good", it's just bad. The representation is terrible, sfx poor, the story is nice and stupid. Even the additives suck, the "pouch guards" seem to carry their weapons like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Do not bother watching this movie, the only thing that distinguishes it is that, no matter how low your expectations, you will still be disappointed.
