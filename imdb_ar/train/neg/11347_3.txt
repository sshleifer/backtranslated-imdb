Cult of the Cobra is now available on a DVD with a print copy that fully recognizes the benefits of a movie. Unfortunately, this does not mean much. <br /> <br /> It contains a qualified second-level group that acquires itself and can be expected under these circumstances. It is efficiently routed, fully-phased audio and stand groups on the studio background. It looks good, but is overly planned, and in 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the double Cobra attack on the first GIs was certainly one attack very much. <br /> <br /> Working around Julia's choice to marry a house rather than Tom does not amount to anything. Tom is instantly in love with Lisa and has no reason to be jealous of Julia (nor are she). <br /> <br /> "Feminine Intuition" is presented to Julia as if it will lead to a development mission plot, but she does not. Similarly, the realization of a house in the cobra sects and the suspicion of the fall of Tom briefly serves no purpose other than filling the screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured like mystery but it is not. Once the curse is spoken, we know exactly where the story is going, so that the characters are left with an effort to discover what we already know. <br /> <br /> The end is particularly lame. Julia is threatened by pure chance. Lisa has no reason to kill her, she is in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom appears in time to save her, it is not clear whether she is at all threatened. Then simply dispose of cobra in the way any of the former victims could have done. <br /> <br /> It is a small, illogical presentation of the story that I found myself wondering how it was placed on the ground. Heads Studio. Then this happened to me. "Val Lewton's movies were very successful at RKO, so why do not we make films like that?" Said one. <br /> <br /> Cultra of the Cobra is clearly designed on Cat People: Mysterious, Troubled, a variable woman in love with the hero, seems to be very cold and kills people and raises doubts about the death of the hero's girlfriend and eventually dies. But "style" does not mean "good" - by a wide margin. They copy, but they do not understand what you are copying. <br /> <br /> Obviously he is trying to use Lowton's low-profile style, but this approach does not follow the story. Lisa is not Irene. They are supposed to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about them. We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so get to know her immediately when she is in New York. There is no doubt about its purpose. There is no ambiguity about whether they do not actually turn into a snake. <br /> <br /> Then again, during the night walk, we get it, not trying one, but two attempts at the "bus". Do not pay off, because the director does not understand what makes "bus" work, and anyway, happens to the stalker, not to the person being chased. <br /> <br /> These weak echoes of Cat People gave the Cult of the Cobra any slight distinction they might have, but they drew attention only to the analogous gap between origin and tradition. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the most sincere form of flattery, but I doubt if Luton or Tourneur would have been particularly flattered when this lukewarm little timer came out.
