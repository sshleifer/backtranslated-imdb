I'm in bad movies but this does not happen. Despite what the booze said above, it is not funny. I know comedies and covert movies, but this is so boring that the director / writer must be prevented from directing anything other than access to the local cable again! To love movies and comedy is to despise this film. I may never get over how bad this boring and tedious work is. If you love this movie, you are reckless where there is nothing here. zero! If you need to compare movies that are under the ground, check out "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the early John Waters movie. The film begins by defining the spelling and challenging anyone to show me the spelling. The rule of comedy is this ... If it's fun, you can say or do something, but if it's not funny, you're not na√Øve, you're not pathetic, you're just pathetic and this film is not funny. zero!
