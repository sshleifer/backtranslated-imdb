This click reminds me of some really bad science fiction movies from the 1950s and 1960s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, stupid and stupid. The special effects are funny, and all the actors are ridiculous, and the result is very bad. Waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey to be very enjoyable because of its stupidity).
