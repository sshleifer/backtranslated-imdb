He had some lovely poetic bits but he was actually just an art uplift - along with any direction or decision. How do these people get through the cinema school? Who gives them money to make this crap? I could have been much more, a good main actor, and I always loved the Fairuza Balk, but come on, Alt-rock metaphor of just staring urgently can not find anything convincing, it's very tired, and definitely movies. The director needs to get away and live a good life for a long time and not go back to the camera so they really have what they say. This is like a spaghetti industry school on the wall, just a bunch of serious pictures and hope to hope for hope like hell where hair appears. This can succeed, if the director already has any kind of vision, or has a mind knows when to be in the presence of potential, but here is just filler of space, and has no result. I felt that the laziness was over in moments before he hit him, and he cried "You bloody villain" on the screen when the credits appeared.
