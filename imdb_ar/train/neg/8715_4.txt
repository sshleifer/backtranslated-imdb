Primitive species come from the legend of B movie, Roger Kurman, and everyone watching this should realize that this low-cost film B, he knows it. <br /> <br /> A group of terrorists carrying a Luria jack and killing an entire army does so, and they believe that it retains uranium, but no ..... It contains two Dino Taste for them human flesh ... Then it is called Team Crack, which may be called Delta Force. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the Jurassic Park, and yes it is never seen clearly because it is clear that the man wearing a costume is not very different from the dinosaur Barney - it's a little too scary, but comes on the players, this was about 1 % Of Jurassic Park budget, and as such does what they can. <br /> <br /> Is this worth being at the bottom 100? .... HELL NO !!! I think that nearly half of the voters who gave this figure 1 - being in a very harsh way, it is much closer to 4 ... It is actually much better than a whole set of other films not at the bottom of 100 and has a similar production value for producing a science fiction channel . (Again the movies that get a very rough time from the critics here on IMDb) <br /> <br /> Representation as expected in movie B Although none of the actors take it seriously, neither the script < > <br /> All in all It's a fun B movie - not for Snobs movie <br /> <br /> ** Out of *****
