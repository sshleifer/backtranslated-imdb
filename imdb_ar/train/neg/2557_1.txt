I really like the asylum films. I've usually made her see as many as possible. Even the shreds they made were as wonderful as EXORCISM and when the killer connected. This is just plain lame. I can not believe that the same people who made "The Dead Man" and "Dracula Corse" made this film already !!! It's not too bad even like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way is very bad). This is just bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or tolerate the bad or lame effects in the asylum movie, but this film takes itself very seriously. I really hope the snakes are in a better train. Now this film I can not wait to see it.
