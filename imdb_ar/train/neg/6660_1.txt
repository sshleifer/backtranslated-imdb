Seriously, the fact that this show is very popular baffles the mind. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a pile of bullfight. Let me start with the characters. Characters are all monochromatic characters with high, exaggerated sounds that look like fingernails on a blackboard. Voice representation may be better. Then there is animation. My God, it only hurts to see him. Everything is very flat, very tapered, very bright, covered with candy. Then there is humor, or lack thereof. It's totally stupid! They take these B-class jokes that are not funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some potty humor useless to accommodate me. Finally and finally, music. It's just plain annoying. It seems to have been configured on a child's computer and generates no emotion at all. I wish there was less than 1 degree, I really. This exhibition needs to be seriously canceled. It's an offer I try to avoid, like plague. Whenever you hear a song song, turn off the TV immediately. If you never see this view, do not. Watch quality programs like The Simpsons or Futurama.
