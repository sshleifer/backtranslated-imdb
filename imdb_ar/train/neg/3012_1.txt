When you do not look at a horrible picture of a narrator in a lecture hall, you watch him prepare the camera to take pictures in different locations. It would be good if the areas that were more relevant to the subject were selected but did not. So, you'll hear more narration, watch some pictures pass and watch as he prepares his camera. Why not use a camera to show more landscapes instead? It really kills any feeling of speed and paints the man as more than a jerk to no avail. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how someone set up their camera, progress quickly throughout this movie and waste much less time.
