Boom itself gained a good reputation. With heavy weights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Lucy, one may be tempted to think, how bad can it be? Well, it's much worse than you imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of "Boom" is that it seems to indicate the drop and fall of the heavy weights mentioned above. It was only director Joseph Lucy who landed in the depths of "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some might want to add "Secret Ceremony"), and recovered. In 1970 he created his best-selling "Go-Between". <br /> <br /> The worst of all is the work of Tennessee Williams. From the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, Williams produced a number of plays that gained a classic status, where they remained in a theatrical repertoire around the world, many of which became well-known films. When Moses abandoned William, perhaps because of his poor drug abuse, he was abandoned forever. Williams at his best is the dream of a representative offering many memorable performances. (Was Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr the best ever in the "Iguana Night"?) Taylor in particular, shone in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer." There is a story that Taylor is supposed to ask John Gilgud if he will teach her to play Shakespeare. "If you teach me to play Tennessee Williams," he said. If Gilgod saw Boom, he would have carried his tongue. Taylor simply was not the worst ever, turned in a relentless performance. Although her face depicts well, she is not polite. As well as physical deterioration, will henceforth lose its credibility as a serious actress with a series of roles that can be completely forgotten (and worse) in their calculation. <br /> <br /> The same can be said of Burton. After his short musical performance, he gained fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point onwards (1968) will not be remarkable at the very least. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward has long ceased to be a force in the theater where his drawing room comedy was replaced by the likes of Williams and the British "Angry Young". He seems to be enjoying himself in the camp, but barely able to make repairs, from the man who claimed this talent. <br /> <br /> The only member to maintain her dignity is the young Joanna Chimkos, who in a few years will abandon a promising career on the screen to become Ms. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> The "boom" swells from self-indulgence; it's simply out of control. There was a rather sad sign of wrong trades instead of a camp fun festival as some suggested.
