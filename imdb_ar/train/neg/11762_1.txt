As a South African, it is an insult to believe that someone was actually paying to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the original Shaka Zulu Minnie, this "add" to this series is awesome! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a strategist, a leader and a brilliant warrior. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> However, the plot of this film is just a hogwash, cut from the bottom of the barrel by a writer who has failed to influence since the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Seely are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, saving the slaves who are steeped in a red robe and his whitish smile? <br /> <br /> I kept expecting blonde women to be bankrupt from nowhere and running on the screen in the little red bathing suit, for no apparent reason. This does not mean it was more unusual than the fictional plot that may have been solved after 10 pints of beer at a masquerade. The caveman costume inspired someone to return to an African idea of ​​his next film.
