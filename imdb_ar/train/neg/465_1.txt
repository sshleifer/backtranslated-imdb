When I was at the movie shop that day, I passed Blond Blonder, but it seemed that something about the subject sounded like a nice movie. Who do you know? I mean, I'm sure most people beat Rumi and Michelle before they saw him, and maybe Blond & Blonder was another secret treasure. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, Wow, I knew I was in something scary. Not only that, but both the top of the enthusiasm: Pam Anderson and Dennis Richards, not abuse them, but they did not get well and they played roles that I thought meant more to women who were supposed to be in their twenties and not forty. The story was very bad and disgusting. <br /> <br /> Dee and Down are your dumb, dumb brothers, they have no idea when it comes to what's happening in the world, it's really sad. But when girls are somehow mistaken for homicide, police officers twist a story and they are actually called genius girls because of their "ignorance is a blessing" attitude. They are prepared to strike someone, and think they will show him a "fun time", but the real killer is determined and wants the case and kills the girls. <br /> <br /> Denise and Pam seem to be very awkward on the screen and seem to have decided the script the day before. I know this was supposed to be a stupid comedy, but it was more than just stupid, and it went abhorrent and unnecessary. Will I recommend this? Over millions of years, girls do not try to maintain their status as "sexual cats"; they are a sign of desperation even more, and is a huge blond and blonde blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
