I could not wait to receive the DVD after hearing a lot about the film. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing films I have ever seen. Many characters, some of them similar to each other, have been introduced so that it is impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney got the acting prize for the film because he was barely involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I surrendered after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVDs. Perhaps I thought of a quick reorientation to see if the end was better, but after a lot of confusion decided that the chances of improvement were slim. A colleague told me that much of the film "meets" at the last minute or less. I was happy because I did not waste another hour waiting. I was given a DVD away the next day.
