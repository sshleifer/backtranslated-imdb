This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar ... well, an apology for lack of clarification, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photographed from the first one in its conception! It was supposed to be a greeting, as the Clockwork poster appeared on the protagonist's wall, yet the word "ripoff" was the most appropriate word. The film felt as if it had been torn directly from the classic Kubrick, filmed only through the eyes of a new director. Blind manager. Unfortunately, when the Koperik massacre ends, the film becomes worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this film has just slipped into your throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed, and in the end meaningless. <br /> <br /> Heroes of neural heroes may be touched if there is any real evolution of personality in this film. I did not feel anything at all for this guy. I'm addicted to alcohol, so I think if anyone can feel anything for him, that would be me. The development of terrible character, dialogue and conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For a film called "16 Years of Alcohol," alcoholism is not a factor in the flick. Look at the first paragraph - it was a slaughtered orange orange and I can not beat it. The most appropriate title was "16 Years of Violence", or even better "A Clockwork Banana". <br /> <br /> Just provide a service to yourself and avoid this movie. If I ignore my advice and take it out anyway, drink it. Trust me.
