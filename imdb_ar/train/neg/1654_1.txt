Final Result: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Potential vandals of the scene (but who cares about hell) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. I rarely give 1. Even for film lovers, looking for things like music, film, fiction, it's a humor, but a good pace to be objectively about the outcome as much as possible. Looking at it within its races or generations. But there is absolutely nothing replaced here. I can not remember again in one of the movies that actually sent me up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I got to the end was that I could not seem to change the channel - I just sat there terrified, watching to see what an insulting stupidity would come next. It was like watching a snake digest mice. <br /> <br /> But let's enjoy and separate this child from each other. First of all, there is nothing technical about the "skin" that works. Images are all comics style. Scenes Cut all the pictures just for street traffic passing through the night again and again. The music and the result not only contribute to anything in the film - it's disgusting. Not to mention that he has nothing to contribute to anyway. Representation is cardboard as it is everywhere, and this applies to Amanda Pitt (obviously "the star" who smashed this train in green) too. These young people, supposedly close friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose, if director Peter M. Cohen assembled them at the bus station minutes before the shooting. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no "original bone" in the body, it has no imagination, it does not show us anything that we have not seen a thousand times, the entire hypothesis is based, or "evolved" Male "and" idea "that women are capable of playing men" just like they play. "Anyone who thinks this is somewhat evolutionary or in no way original obviously has not operated a television before. Male is the rule, he does not steal anything specifically, it's worse: he steals from cliches ... I can not imagine women watching a film portraying other women who rely so much on Stereotypical images with this feeling of disdain make me want to go for rent in the Men's Company - or better yet, "there's something about Mary." This film wants to be a "more recent" version of "There's Something About Mary" So you can see the race. <br /> <br /> The film has no insights on women, men, dating, sex, or anything else, and Cohen is simply satisfied with the repetition of legends from other sex movies. Other, the film does not act as a satire either, because although it has come with exaggeration, one can be seen as "satirical" but does not have this basis in fact Which needs satire. They do not even know what is comic. Then there is a dialogue, which is a little more characters that yell at each other. Example 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yes, good f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> The end result, which can excuse all others discretion: There are a lot of films without plots, without good representation, with morally repulsive personalities and a terrific and terrifying dialogue that was so enjoyable and so good. "Leather" is not funny. Not for one second. Has no comic skills or timing. All positions are completely false, not in any atom of truth, especially enough to repel laughter from us. The characters are plotted so widely that SEEM appears to be moved below the lowest common denominator. Just look at the "marquee scene," "cult classic" hair gel scene. One of our troubled heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mina (Peet) rocking. For some reason it shines on him as if he had found the Holy Grail. Why does Cohen think that men interact in this way with the vibrator I do not know? While rubbing it on himself, he drops it into the toilet and then tries to get rid of it with his bare hands when Minna sits on it. Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But it's strange that people really love this movie. Of course, people like "friends" and realistic dating shows so I should not be surprised. All this has a common thread though. "Skin" is a great proof to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America laughing at any joke just because it is related to sex. They will love any show or film (or think they love it) just because it's about dating or relationships. It lacks any quality that has no baring on these people. Just as people who want to sell whiter teeth and thinner objects to their toothbrush and weight loss programs are taught to blindly discourage anything from dating / relationship about selling cheap, empty, hard-working television, movies, and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only solution is that when I die, because I watched this movie, I've got the balance to restore 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
