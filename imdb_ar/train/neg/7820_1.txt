Or: It's a bird? It's a plane? No, see ... it's a disaster! Or: No need to search the sky. <br /> <br /> Or: (... well, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic film like the movie to break the record at the box office, he failed. The SR structure can not do this, the dark and tight color scheme (I can call it "witch-washi"), the usual boring boring dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, the fun and the lost magic, etc. makes the movie quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> It simply does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing in a character like a supernatural man is that he is a supernatural hero. This is the essence of the most important thing. <br /> <br /> The problem of Love and Supersoftie, unfortunately, can only be lost in Superman's 2:40 movie, not all the time. <br /> <br /> Because he is no longer a Superman movie or supernatural hero. It is like a social study (in this case very bad and boring), where the person moves every 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Sky Torchs, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and the most important thing, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want entertainment! Singer, if you want to create a long spirit in which a problem occurs 2:40 revolve around the problem of people wandering and sadness? Then take natural characters from humans and reshape yentl. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman Returns. And then, standing supersadlysoftie in the door. <br /> <br /> The singer may have tried to kill the legend without the kryptonite, but one bad film can not do it. Do not give up, they're planning to finish ... <br /> <br /> A singer next time (and Warner Brothers) makes a great movie, not a very depressed patient, or let it go. The supernatural film means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a supercasing. Yes, technically, there are all kinds, yes, there are a lot of small conversations, there are a few jokes, motion scenes, etc., but the only thing all these worst parts share is their poor quality. It's nothing more than a super-boring mixture and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The cast strategy is ridiculous (cast them as young as possible, so we can make a sequel in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth is a 22-year-old star reporter who looks like 19 years old. Superman was five years old, so he slept with her for 6 years. She was 16 years old (13 years old) and a daily planet reporter, writing "I spend a night with Superman." Warner Brothers, this is very much. <br /> <br /> Ruth is not so bad, he plays a bit of wood, but the whole movie is wooden, so ...?! Temporary good was confused and sometimes reckless. The rest, forget it. Even space, this is not its topography. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder was acting so easily, with pleasure. What a difference. <br /> <br /> Jesus is finally ridiculous as well. What the hell should it be? The problem here is that it means it is dangerous, not as a joke. Next time a Spider-Man or Batman or Iron Man falls like Jesus or the Angels? Or speak to God directly. why not ? They are superheroes, saving human lives every day. So, there must be at least one Hadith with God every week ... my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is not the real movie, it's a boring parallel world. <br /> <br /> For the Warner Brothers, this super-depressive coma may be the greatest disaster in history. Not only because of money. <br /> <br /> I understand how hard it is (perhaps) to create and transmit some messages or emotions, but to show the only people who are missing and unfortunately are not new and thousands of movies or do TV shows better, in very old or new programs like Magnolia. Frogs were the most impressive plane of this flying superwoman, sorry, Superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, this is simply nothing. In fact, it is more than nothing, it is like a black hole that destroys the passion of movies (comic / supernatural) and robbed us three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> The younger brother of Smilla. (Very angry and green like a temple.)
