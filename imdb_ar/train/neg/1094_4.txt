That's hard to describe - if you're a fan of Ross Mayer's movies today, you're sure to be happy to see that Hajji still looks very hot, even though Furyre Ackerman was not very good (what he's been doing so far) Is it? If I go up to him using a camera, will it be in my film? It was a wonderful and fun idea - a supernatural superhero champion is her secret weapon - but sometimes his length did not go away, jokes were level with regular Joe E. Brown comedy (or Abbott) and Costello if that was your thing) The pun is just bad. However, I found this movie great to watch, and for more than two reasons. Function is good, but still production is basically flimsy.
