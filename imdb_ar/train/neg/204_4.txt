The ideal murder is thwarted when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of Robert Zemikis, who led the episode), who kills her husband in poker, is unfortunately greeted by a visitor who is about to move the outer body. Crazy wearing a Santa Claus suit (Played by Dirty Larry Drake). She clings to her life as she tries to find a way to hide her husband's body. She decided to use the ax, as soon as she shot down the Santa killer who misses many opportunities to cut off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. She is locked up in Santa's closet and stalks the daughter of a woman as she desperately tries to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of The CRYPT tales recycles the materials that involve the old Santa Killing. In addition, the routine you use frequently (plus nausea), the wives of her husband's husband versus a man, They were cheated with the routine. It is Traynor's attempt to basically find a way to avoid falling into a dead body that kills her while maintaining a safe distance from madness. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot that goes largely through suggestions. Not one of the highlights of the show.
