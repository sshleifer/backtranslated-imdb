"Fly Me To the Moon" should be the worst animated film I have seen in a long time. That's what he's been saying since I took my son to see every animated version 4 years ago. The story is to be generous ... vulgar. Voice representation is terrible, sounding very nice. Humor from the Romper Rom Group. Animations are acceptable for a type of animation of Nickolodeon type, but are released on the big screen and not on cable television. <br /> <br /> You get only 2 because of their "OK" 3D images. Some of the scenes had a moderately stimulating image but we have seen much better in the past. I also wonder about the determination of filmmakers to move characters away from the screen rather than in most scenes. While this was interesting at first, it became exhausting after the third or fourth time. It seemed like a squeak of indifference to me by the creators. <br /> <br /> I will say this even though he had great soundtrack. For the record, my son was not too mad about him. A bad film.
