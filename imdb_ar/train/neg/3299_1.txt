This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was expecting a really bad film, but I was surprised or not. The story is traditional, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so badly written that it actually laughs when non-half actors try to make it seem real. The picture is not very good, the music is very bad, which made me really angry, and the actors are not trying, so that the script makes it almost impossible to expect more people who are acting for 30 years and so-called action In fact, the viewer can not lack the same "procedure" . <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these kinds of bad films continue to emerge, who finances this shit? Where is the examination? Why do actors on the ground take this task? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even looking to reach the theaters, but even straight to video movies actually run to look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about this except for the title that explains everything, I feel stolen for two hours of my life.
