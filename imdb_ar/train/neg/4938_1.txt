Caves were by far the biggest burden of waste that wasted my time watching. This offer is based on the less commercial commercial Geico ads and the actual 30-second ad for Geico. The composition was at least half author. It is difficult to imagine a caveman with conservative white teeth even after going to the dentist. This offer can potentially have a funny entertaining series if they can get representatives from commercials, making it a bad show. Perhaps if the book is identical in Geico ads, it might be an opportunity, and instead the pilot lacks a good storyline. I give this offer 1 out of 10, I would put zero out of 10 but this was not an option. I pray for the swift death of this offer, and I will give him less than five rings before he dies a worthy death.
