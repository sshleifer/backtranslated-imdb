The story was fine. Akshay Kumar was as good as he always had and this was the only good thing in the film. Karina Kapoor looked bad. There was a very hue and cry over its zero size but it did look good and smaller. I do not know why Anil Kapoor accepts this bad role. There was not much to do for him in the film. Just because Yashraj film does not mean that the actor must accept the role no matter how bad. Saeed Ali Khan was fine. I think the time has come for Indian directors and producers to think of Indian customers as smart. What are we? Fools !!!! What do they think, will show two men take the SWAT band for four, we will believe them. Are the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to arrest some criminals ... They are taking a whole group of 100 policemen and there was no one to encircle the palace. The work was nonsense and I did not see such bad work. Akshay Kumar was among a circle of 30 to 40 policemen who shot and shot all of them. No police bullet hit him but he killed all the policemen. crap. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the battle manager who thought about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend not watching this movie.
