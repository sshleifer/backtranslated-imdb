I think most of them want to believe that there are unusual things and this film does not show any restraint in trying to make the most of it. The presentation is very fun and well presented and the graphics are modern, but from a scientific point of view, it does not work. Hydrogen filled bladder fly? The size of the Mack truck should be useful. Then there is a permanent possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with imagination, just do not try to turn into reality. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all a fun movie, but I always find myself saying "my brother, what a load ....". If you want a fake documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at least turn off sound.
