Sorry for my neighbors colleagues in Nevada City, but that's bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must be suffering from a lot of Botox because he had very few facial expressions through the entire film. <br /> <br /> Alice did not look as if she had a plate tied to her ass. It was harsh throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I looked at both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the intense work. I thought they were students in the first year. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason have both candidly uploaded the film with their convenience and ease in every line. Ed certainly did not lose charisma. I wish I had time to meet him when he was here. <br /> <br /> I like the snow scenes, shop scenes and church because I was there. I make Nevada City my home and I was eagerly waiting for the first offer. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
