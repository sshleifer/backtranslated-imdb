Although it is not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The Risks of Pauline" is certainly an idiot. The title may lead you to expect to honor the Pearl White (the original Bolin in the series 20 silent episodes of 1914) but for that, you will get better service through the 1947 edition of Betty Hutton. The 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and Elvis's weakest. Worst of all, it is not a combination of these elements, but it is more like a person who is recorded together with pieces cut off from one another so that it goes back and forth between the two modes. <br /> <br /> What is the unit in the production comes from the association between Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steedman), a good game because they both lack the simplest acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore) playing against Dan Coyle) . <br /> <br /> Austin will later play against John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", with the contrasting talent between them actually painful to watch. In the mid-1960s, the girl, "Dodge Ribillon", was featured in a similar series of perilous situations imaginable by Sandra De in a dark blue suit. When the automaker's advertising agency replaced the girl, "Dodge Fever" got a bright idea for a feature film. <br /> <br /> What the story here begins with Pauline who grew up in Baskerville Foundling Home run by actress who played the role of Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr in "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline and not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages many of the opportunities she has to adopt. George leaves for his fortune and 19-year-old Pauline gets a job teaching the prince of the oil-rich Middle East. When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem, he escapes and moves from danger to danger. Among them are the African dwarfs, the 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze until his one-year-old grandson is enough to marry, film and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is meant to be silly and charming but only manages a ridiculous part. There is some effort to integrate the appearance of a silent film into the motion sequence by simulating the camera controller (which accelerates motion). Unfortunately, everything else (film stocks, production design, editing) is frustrating in the 1960s. Nothing here comes close to the pictures of Pearl White attached to a log moving towards a trencher or attached to a railway track waiting for a nearby train. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
