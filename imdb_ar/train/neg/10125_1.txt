... that was what I got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad this is. If you're having trouble sleeping, you can leave within 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Laurie was a good actor in the 1940s - but he called him here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Laurie doubled the scope of the camera because his belt was too tight! Duncan looks like a motorcycle hood more than a boy who wonders - in fact he looks like a man in his thirties waiting for Laurie to get out so he can wear the big head. <br /> <br /> The Batmobile, which seems to have backed away from the Honest Al's Used Lot, is driving at a lower price than the stickers - the Dynamic Duo is not doing much to hide the fact that it is a Bruce Wayne-driven car - indeed, All over the serial. <br /> <br /> The representation is wooden - the groups are cheap - the dialogue is horrible, and if there is text to follow, I'm sure it reads like "Batman says something here" because it sure seems they're making it as he walks. <br /> <br /> Batman's utility belt is made of thin canvas with no clear bags to keep his tools - in one scene when Batman needs a full-size flame of producers in one while the scene begins - can not be seen again. His chin is so bad he can not even see it, and his ears seem more like examining the mop with the more disgruntled Easter Bunny than anything else. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I do not do that), Batman replaces the radioactive radiation that will burst into flames in the second in the air as a reward for some caps. It's radioactive so he can track it - and cause it to be very flammable. Well, unfortunately, the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse - we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks and pushes those boxes weighing about six ounces on the hoods to get them out - and soon the whole place burns on the ground. Thank you Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman informs a passing car driver in the middle of nowhere and takes his car - leaving the man to defend himself and telling him not to worry that if Batman smashes the car, the police will definitely buy him another one! Yes, I guessed it, he said the car was coming out of the abyss in a few short seconds. It is not important for the driver, who probably died because of his attempt to return to Gotham. <br /> <br /> There is a tired sub-plot with the clone of Lewis Lynn Vicky Fall, who Bruce Wayne is convinced is Batman - you must have noticed that the Batmobile was parked outside Bruce's house - or perhaps she saw Batman and Robin walking in the crowded suburbs Clearly populated. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - and everyone except the younger people in the audience will want to throw the toast on the screen. If you're looking for a bad cinema, you can not get a better mark - if you want entertainment, try Burton Batman, Adam West Batman, or the former Lewis Wilson Batman.
