The film begins with a beautiful song like excitement, with Arbaz Khan wandering in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced into comedy. Their scenes are very funny first and then you feel bored. There is a sub-plot of boredom to the brother of Tanushri killed towards the end. The film tries to be serious with the villain who abducts our heroes, but here it becomes stupid and then reaches its climax. From HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase at the Payal house <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it makes you fall asleep <br /> <br /> The output from Priyan is very bad music (Pritam) > <br /> Filming is bad, and the film has a cheap look all the time <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good at the first scene where he goes to pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not high and on top like other films but no, he becomes himself The usual and disturbs Most of the time Tusshar must not speak in a film, his request is terrible that Sharman is the salvation grace, he is the only actor who works very well in this film tries Kunal Khemmu Hard in his first film comedy film as an adult, but not as impressive Tanushree as bad as always with Arbaaz Khan is a less range, and as usual payal unrepresented Murli Sharma is terrible
