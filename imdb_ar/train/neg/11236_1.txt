As a former Kalamazoo inhabitant of the city, I was looking forward to watching this film. But, what a disappointment! Although the values ​​of representation and production is not bad, the scenario is very bad, the plot is unrealistic, the topic is worrisome. <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that women are nothing without child pairs. I can hardly believe how regressive it is to women. Was the writer living under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I did not suggest it to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment to the city named after it.
