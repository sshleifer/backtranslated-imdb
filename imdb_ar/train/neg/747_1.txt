Finally, I thought that someone would do justice to HG Wells's classic, not another version assigned in a wrong language or era, but a version that is firmly based on the book. Well, it certainly follows the book closely, and this is the only addition to this mess. <br /> <br /> The length of this book is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours), and the book does not exceed 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Heinz has the nerve to come here and say "If you can do better ..." I will say "Yes, I can" and I never used a video camera or I was in any genre or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I have paid good money to deliver these waste to the United Kingdom from the United States of America, and do not commit the same mistake.
