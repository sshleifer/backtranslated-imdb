=== Little Spoilers === <br /> <br /> I, like many others, are huge fans of Jerry Brockheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters dangling in the foreground, the trailer came before MI: 2, expectations were going up. Produced by Jerry Brockheimer. Large cars. Nick Cage and the new Oscar Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? a lot. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (which tries to be really difficult) and not sexy. I put a black person who makes racist jokes constantly about himself and about Wooh-haa !! Have a comedy? I do not think so. Excitement outside the picture completely. First of all (perhaps this has been said many times) there are no sympathetic figures, who cares who kills? If you can read the hypothesis that my soul will kill Nick's brother if he does not steal 50 cars in four days, the next thing you know is that Kip is walking with Nick on the streets again. Is this excitement? Do not think. Then comes the best romantic bits between Nick and Angelina. She actually looks bored to utter all these stupid lines for Nick. 'do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" 'what happened?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one glimmer of hope: chasing the car. It is disappointing to say as little as possible, because the trailer made it seem full of it, and there is only one clip. One is too long, caught in the motion of the frantic alarming camera. You have encountered a problem following the action. <br /> <br /> Is it action movie? Sexy movie? A romantic comedy? - There is no need to make a decision, just avoid this terrible mess. I will give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel honored.
