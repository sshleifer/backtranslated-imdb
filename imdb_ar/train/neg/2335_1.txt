A very insecure movie, perhaps the innovators hoped to have a classic title in the original film "Farewell My Lovely", believing naive would assume it was a new edition. The characters are so foul and unattractive that they deserve a cold welcome when they first launch. Time adds to it just silly. The lack of any deception, cinematography, despair or despair of the classic Noir, instead relied on a senseless crime plot that would easily lead to several arrests within hours. As if this was not enough, it has led to a completely erotica attempt to exercise rudeness since no one bothered to shower at least several days. This only made this mess more painful to watch. Find a good classic 1940s or 1950s film Noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure.
