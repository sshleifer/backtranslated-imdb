Hi, deal with it, there are far better photos of black American suffering than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism focuses on the weak implementation of the story, which I mentioned, strikes. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-1980s and it is awesome in the music / score section. It's funny to see Oprah as a kind of crack on the last day. <br /> <br /> Bigger is pushing Elizabeth McGovern to the Holocaust. Pure classical cinema. First, I do not care how drunk you are, you will respond to a flame of 1200F degree (no matter how bad your behavior). But they really milk this scene ... it was a comedy. I'll tell you about it, I felt very relieved to see Elizabeth McGovern burn with a fake death; it bothers me.
