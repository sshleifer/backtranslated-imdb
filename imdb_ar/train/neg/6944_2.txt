The premise of the film is that the son of Thomas Archer was killed and that his wife was brutally abused - and that he was given the opportunity to retaliate when (after treatment of PTSD), put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and said this is the culprit. He has been given a great schedule of tools through which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, hammer, torches, all you can think is that someone might want to use it to physically hurt someone else. <br /> <br /> We went to too many scenes of torture before we discover that The Man Archer is tortured, not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an uncomfortable alliance. Of their position in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when everything is said and done, we do not really care ...
