It is often said that Tobe Hooper was fortunate in his 1974 horror film "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and every time I see another film Hooper - this view is reinforced only. It seems that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films like Scanners and Firestarter in 1990, so we get to Spontaneous Combustion; a movie with two good ideas and a full load that is more borrowed than other films. Put all this together and you'll get a messy and boring movie that most people will do well to miss! The film leads the audience to believe that it may be half-decent at first with an interesting story focusing on some of the experiences of two young men in the 1950s. The couple had a baby and shortly thereafter burned to death as a result of their experiments. Fast forward some years and the child is now an adult named Sam. But naturally he is not a layman and is soon discovered when he discovers that he has the ability to set fire to his will. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Brad Dorf, who had to have looked like a good choice for the Sabok success in Child Play two years ago; but in fact it was an uninspiring decision as the central performance is really terrible; . The ambiguous direction and the dull scenario also do not lead to many preferences for the film, and the trend of lack of preferences continues to be sustained by special effects, which are very unrealistic and contain nothing in the films separated from the film; The plot is really slow, which is almost an hour before anything important happened, and I did not care about it until then. It soon becomes clear what direction the film will take, all of which is the hard end you expect. The final showdown is a big disappointment and nothing really explains during the film. This does not mean that any revelation may be fun anyway. In general, this is a nonsense film and another reason makes Tobe Hooper away from being a great horror director. See Firestarter again instead.
