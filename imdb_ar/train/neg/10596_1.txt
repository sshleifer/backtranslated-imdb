Van Dam. What can I say? Bill Goldberg. There we go. Now we know that this movie will be terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But not even I thought it would be that bad. The plot is terrible, and Van Dam gets old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are as well. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Do not see it. Start. I will not even be driven to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Stars - In her heart is a fascinating and exciting journey full of excitement. But marketers certainly want to think about it, do not they? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
