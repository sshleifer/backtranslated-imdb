This short comedy film Hal Roach, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in our series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh. Bascally an offer of the black comedy Stepin Fetchit who gets special bills here, we see him go to his hut where the gang hangs. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and asks Stephen to read it because he can not read it during the day as he goes to Knight School. Happens to be his sweetheart in Tennessee so far Farina has his ears stuffed with cotton because it's too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer instructs Mary Anne about making candy from the radio, but as he continues to jog back and forth to the kitchen, he misses the idea of ​​the lady announcer to the rice pudding and the Spanish tamale that marries Ann Marie with the additions of Tapasco and Luccas! After the fabrication is complete, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves to taste awful but the material is very sticky because everyone is stuck on the walls as a result. As they all try to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on many pipes and electrical outlets that combine the functions of variable devices such as the vacuum-free phone, the vacuum that rings, and the refrigerator that plays the music! End. What she has just described foreshadows the curvy nature of our short story "Our Gang," which pioneered a short series of Stepin Fetchit films. It has never happened because the Fetchit description of the lazy nigger was only amusing at small doses and would be considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for some laughter although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were useless to me. So in short, harsh winter is a masterpiece worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stephen was the real name of Lincoln Theodore Perry.
