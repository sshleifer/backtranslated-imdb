I really did not have high expectations and I must admit I was not disappointed. This movie is so bad that I felt I had to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others to waste their time. The story is awesome and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie "Can things get worse?" Yes it can! Somehow they managed to make it worse every minute and you end up thinking "I want to get back an hour and 35 minutes!" Someone got to pay for this! <br /> <br /> I challenge you to find a worse film ... <br /> <br /> I did not expect any great expectations and I must admit I was not disappointed.
