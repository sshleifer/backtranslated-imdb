With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be acceptable at least. Not so. After the first half of an hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hands so it was fast forward on standby. Vulgar, standard, one knows what will happen in every scene. One can even predict the word of dialogue for the word. This is one of those films that make upside-down movies and says, "How did you make that film?" In an attempt to say something positive, I will add that there are some moderately amusing special effects. But overall, if you've watched 5 Sci / fi movies, or if you're over 9 years old, do it yourself and skip this movie.
