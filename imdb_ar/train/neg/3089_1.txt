This movie is very bad, it's a comedy. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television program where three characters of irony and sarcastic characters are seen, used this particular film to be ironic. I suggest watching it (perhaps on YouTube) rather than actually watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see Hobgoblins if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. In fact, do not see this film, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have more fun spoofing or watching her parody then watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick when you watch, so spare yourself. read a book. wash clothes. Nothing more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
