Philippe Harel's French film "Extend de Domaine de la Lot" is based on the film of the same name as controversial writer Michel Houlebeck. He has also worked on the scenario of this film. According to British film magazine Sight and Voice, also known as "whatever." This film was praised as a refreshing air for French cinema because of its uncommon theme of sex politics and its impact on two stupid IT workers. The film has a very clear voice that identifies us as the main character. This makes us feel as if we are watching a book that brings reading. The basic premise of the problems associated with loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is a good idea, but the film gets out of control once the hero begins to recount the misery he and his friend face. In the midst of sticking to its main theme, the film moves in other directions leading to its fall. Beware: Some women's views may not only affect the film, but even its heroes as obsessed women obsessed.
