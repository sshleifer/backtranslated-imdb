** Contain the spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Shawn Young (who looks in some scenes, her hair is puzzling, looks like Elizabeth Taylor) appears in her opening moments in this film. Sitting her face and body in the back of a police car waiting for a signal to bust, tense and scattered. Unfortunately, once the bust has ended, Young's behavior has not changed. This actress is prevented by death. <br /> <br /> One has to compare the young man and the actress who plays the role of her best friend and friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional and relaxed at all times ... because there is no clear barrier between what you may feel and express it. It's an open book. A young man, on the other hand, acts in a self-conscious, volatile manner that you might expect your neighbor to behave if you are suddenly thrown into a movie starring. Basically, she has no clue. <br /> <br /> With this huge void looming in the middle of the film, we have left to reflect on the mystery of the story. For example, after Miss Young was abducted by the offender who was giving him up and his closet in a closet, she broke the door when she left alone. Granted, she wears a bra and panties only, but in a similar situation, with a back snatching myself at any moment, do you go to the door ... or take the time to go through his racket, get out some clothes and wear? I think these scenes and others are trying to point out some kind of mixed feelings that Miss Young's personality has, but Young can not convey this kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some moving moments in the film, such as police brief interviews with former victims of the criminal, but this is a whole goal without a goal. It's very bad Ms. Young was replaced by a pair of comic-book movies that may have used her limits with some humor (Batman and DICK TRACY), because stumbling while trying to play real people is oddly effective. Watching Miss Young try to act, at least in this "teaser", is a sad sight.
