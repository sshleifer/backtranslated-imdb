This film was two hours and a quarter hours grinding. Someone please tell me what point? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical environment. It is supposed to be around a shabby group of Confederate (terrorists?) Warriors on the Missouri-Kansas border, with revenge from all North sympathizers and the abolition of slavery during the American Civil War. But regardless of the unjustifiable violence, there was really no point in the film. Maybe it was a political statement? That war is really nothing more than justifiable violence? If this is the point that has been done well, but I do not think this is the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a useful film here, but as far as I was concerned, there was a complete lack of any conspiracy. It was as if I were watching a vibrant paperback novel, and characters that would look like the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This movie should be burned with some towns where this gang belongs to burning!
