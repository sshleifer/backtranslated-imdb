Hip or bump. lustful. Wicked sexy ... whatever. It's "Terminator" with wolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The policeman saves the girl (waitress!) From the big monster and refers to himself as the "protector" of her. Lead actor Ryan Alusio is doing a very good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... There is a massacre at a police station ... The bad guy is red-eyed and even has a dialogue like "I said it yourself, it will never stop." The script for the first time, thankfully, has not sold anything since then, and is all thrown by the famous bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a bar bar. (Always a good sign), the average-looking biker man exploded for no apparent reason, followed by three cops. One of them is black, and (shock horror!) Is the person who kills in the first five minutes. The film moves down at the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some nice sequences, before it is rounded completely by a bad ending. <br /> <br /> Mostly, actors show competent actors do what they can with a bad screenplay and a director who is willing to settle less. If there is nothing else, they seem to learn how to act in this film and Alosio, along with some supporting actors, shows signs of talent. In his human form, DarkWolf plays the role of giant Ken Hodder - famous for his many portraits of Jason Vorhis in "Friday 13". It is decent enough, especially considering that it is not used to speaking roles. <br /> <br /> He became famous among groups of teenage boys peers for their lesbian counterparts on the surface between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, whom she takes a few times in the tradition of the former Power Rangers. It is quite clear that the editor has spent WAY a long time on this scene ... Anyway, the main recovery feature is that the physical wolf's effects are fairly good, and that the wolf's design is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. Just bad bad. I mean seriously, if you can not reach the level of realism - why bother? Just throw a little money into make-up! Apart from the terrible scenario, this film has its moments, many unintentionally funny. It's good to laugh if you do not have anything better, but do not spend any money on it. Please.
