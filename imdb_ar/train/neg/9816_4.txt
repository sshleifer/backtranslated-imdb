This movie was like the wreck of a bad train, as terrible as it was, you still have to keep watching it. My friend and I rented it and wasted two hours from our day. Now do not get me wrong, good behavior. Only the film as a whole just angered us both. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this film, I had to go to rent something else was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very exciting actress. Her personality seems obsessive and not there. Daryl Hannah, although she has finished playing, is doing a great job in overcoming her situation. I found myself more than once and when I screamed on television I told her to fight or be subjected to violence. All in all, very violent film ... not for the faint of heart.
