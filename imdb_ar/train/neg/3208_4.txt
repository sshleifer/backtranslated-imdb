This film was a big disappointment to me. I was waiting for this movie to appear for years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until I went bankrupt. Not only did they cut off half the story line, they changed the information. To say that Satan is the father of hope is not true. She spoiled her father, but he himself is not her father. As the voices did not match the characters, once you hear the voice of the beloved character, you can never repeat the sound you heard in your mind. I can not even remember everything about this movie which was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death do not watch this movie. It just did not do comic justice at all!
