What an incomprehensible mess for a film. (About 50 times the size of the jar that has been shot up to now) and a highly secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who are driving to Mexico for some reason. Whether they are intentionally sent there or just really lost, this will never be explained. You will never hear another script that displays the word "butthorn" too. Gary Bossi tries to play Mel Gibson from "The Deadly Weapons", while Bossi is considered a good actor for the service, the film's scenario eliminates the whole film for mediocrity. William Smith plays the role of another Russian soldier, the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years ago. After playing in biker sport in most of the 1970s, it was good to see him expand his game to the Communists. Sadly, he may always be remembered best as the man Clint Eastwood has acquired in "everything you can."
