I'm not sure it was the language or the bad acting, but everything in this film seems expensive and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, this is a great disappointment. There is no relationship between the different scenes, the incredibly weak representation, so I could not believe that people could commit such a mess for something with great potential. <br /> <br /> Above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. big mistake. German has a certain voice, especially Hitler himself seems only like Hitler when he speaks / screams German. <br /> <br /> The way the story was told made me think it was impromptu immediately, the characters were empty and the film seemed to be a set of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
