Unlike the great cinematography of James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real stink. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I have seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first is Charles Logton's "Rembrandt". It was so bad that I closed it. This situation I fear is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Her performance as Queen Victoria may have been good for the 1937 standards, but when compared to Helen Mirren's performance, it is no match at all. In robotic fashion, Robson states her lines. Its anti-English message is very faint. <br /> <br /> Even Laurence Olivier the heir can not save the absolute bit of boredom. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivian Les is in a supportive role here and does not move anything here. To think, Scarlett was two years later! <br /> <br /> It is a shame that history with the Spanish fleet is very boring in this film.
