It is clear that the script writers of this film did not consult any books about Lucille Paul, especially her autobiography. I have never seen a lot of mistakes in autobiography, from her first years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Daisy. I can write a complete list of factual errors, but it will continue on the pages. All in all, I think Lucille Ball is one of those corrupt people who can not be photographed by anyone else. If you were Lucy Arnaz and Desi Junior, I would be angry at the number of mistakes made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the film seemed dirty to me.
