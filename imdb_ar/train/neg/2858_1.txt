This must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were awful, the acting was a B movie, and the effects were just qualifying for the Nintendo 64. Do you think they will do more in it. Of course, it's a Scifi movie movie so you have to expect it to be a low rate, but this one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, the sponsor shook your head in the movie infidelity, this film is good. <br /> <br /> Although there seem to be "well-known" actors and actors in this, it is hard for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film deserved their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Maybe the graphics were good in the seventies or seventies of the last century, but come on, 2009. I will not give the spoilers, let's say that if you play "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you will be aware of what you see in this The movie <br /> <br /> definitely not worth two hours it took to sit through the thing
