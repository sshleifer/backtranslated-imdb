What time do we live when you like someone like Joe Swan - whatever the hell, he's a good film director ... or even a film director at all! Where is the new crop of directors with brains and talents ??? We need them badly, and to know the hell using mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie does not revolve around anything, just as the characters in the film symbolize nothing. This is the terrible Gen Y, full of stupid fools, some of whom are making filmmakers without bothering to learn anything about the vehicle before shooting. Well, Orson Wells was a way out. John Houston was a director. Fellini was a director. Drier was a movie maker, etc. Current films such as these show how young stupid "stupid" idiots, when they believe in going out without a scenario, without direction, without thinking, without a "forensic photographer" (everything is filmed terribly), there is no editing craft, no Something, the film industry means "rebel" or "advanced." No, it's called ignorance and laziness or pure masturbation of cinema (and there's actually an "absolute shot" in your face, so be ready). <br /> <br /> Look at the early films of any independent filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzz ... Something is boring and aimless this, however, Swan - whatever the hell - is still on her way to the SXSW every year and hailed her as a kind of brave and new talent. It's crap! I can not imagine anyone who likes this, and everything else this so-called director (everything I see before him) is very bad (the newer things are clearly designed to attract a more popular audience, one of the comedic calls). In the second thought, if you are a family member or a friend, you are likely to be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> Trash pronunciation. This is not art. This is quite the opposite.
