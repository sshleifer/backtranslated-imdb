With this family attempt for ABC that has been a big success "cheaper than dozens", comes a foul amount of lively dialogue, shallow plot lines, and cheese back. With about two good actors among many wanna-be's, this movie was very disappointed. In Hollywood also wannabe of the already bad plot. After that, because they needed a lot of actors, this meant they were probably more lenient. It was not a five-star representation. The plot moved fairly quickly, the twists were bad and their timing was bad. The intersection of characters and "final relationships" was also soft and very cliched for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
