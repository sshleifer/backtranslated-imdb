Larry Cohen's often uncommon attempt (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High is trying to be funny and fail miserably, even with decent turns by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arken seems embarrassed throughout his performance and his son Adam seems simply sedated. This makes Teen Wolf look like a classic comedy.
