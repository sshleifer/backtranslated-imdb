A very horrible Mexican film based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist who wants to enter the confines of a hiding place in the woods to write a story about how he works, etc. When our hero Gaston is given the great offer of Dr. Maylard, We see all sorts of things that are supposed to be appalling, like the men who hang out in a long cell, and the comedian, like our soldier-joking hero climbing a ladder hanging over the side of the building. Then there is one scene that was probably supposed to be both: a human being dressed in chickens, yes, he is a real chicken, moving around the ground to feed chickens. The scene was supposed to be a highlight of the comedy film, but at least for me, it was the low point in the film and the most disgusting when I thought that adult men and women thought this might be fun remotely. Uh! This is actually a real horror that embodies Dr. Tar and the Chorus Corps name. This leads me to this salient fact about which film is most films that are subject to multiple changes in the title and is usually a sort of serious problem. Yes, that's obvious, but some of them have distribution problems, and others, including one, have so many changes in the title that someone can probably buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely rubbish. She has very little going for it. The only artist worth looking at is Claudio Brooke as the head of asylum. It's a huge plate of pork, he laughs obsessively and orders to blow out the teak with the sword in his hand and praises the chicken. Much tired of hearing him talk about "calming system" as a way to treat mental patients. What a bunch of gloss (oh film like this with a text like this worth the kind of word). It will not take long to see what is going on in the resort and will not be more interesting. Scratch Chicken Film!
