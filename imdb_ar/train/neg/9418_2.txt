This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and renaming. It does not work at all. First, the whole play is wrong. It moves very slowly at first and then moves in a hurry and unsatisfactory. But there are also (and perhaps reductions) an unstable movement between species. It starts with being an exciting film taken in nominal value and then turned into a farce rather than a satire. The end may be funny, but it is also so expressive that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little). So the film tries to be everything but it does not really work on any level at all. You can also see it in an unstable personality development. You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles instead of one.
