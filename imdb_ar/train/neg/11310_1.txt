First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you do not already know it, I think you're a fool. But let's assume that neither of us is a chieftain. We all know that animals have emotions, and now want to see how these emotions manifest themselves in their nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we get instead is a boring and ridiculously simple documentary that tries to show how animals are "human." Directors look for high and low images of animals that engage in human-like behavior. When they do, they say, "This monkey is almost human!" (This is actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is humanitarian. They are wasting time on the theory of what makes dogs "smile", but not once do they remember the tail tail. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. So they went even further to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing cowboy hats. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a documentary about animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how to bite animals in their own languages. But instead, researchers continued to retreat from observations, stereotypes, assumptions. Add a full audio clip and pictures of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas," which was enough to transform my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary was filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All camera shots of chimpanzees pass through steel bars, and see how these monkeys congregate together in their sterile concrete cages. One particularly awkward moment comes close to the beginning (although you must be quick to notice it), where a monkey in a sign language says, "Get out, hurry up." <br /> <br /> Reference is made to the ambiguous references to "stress tests" and psychic experiences that shuddered from her imagination. Small monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given metal wire dolls to prove that the small monkeys crave the "mother figure". After 40 years of experimentation, fanatical researchers discourage themselves on their backs to reach their remarkable conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> One chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a cage since 1966 for this purpose. , And to this day remained so. We get a brief overview (again through the bars) of their tendency against a concrete wall with a rather weak expression. Personally, you do not need to see any other experimental data. Ashou, I apologize for our entire race.
