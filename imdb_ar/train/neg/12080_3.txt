I admire both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I eagerly waited to see this episode. I will comment on the film first, then the MST3K ring. Recipe for this film: The talented actors, Shakespeare's rich and beautiful materials, and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, so dull and lifeless. The cold is presented in a large boiler of ordinary stone. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because representatives at least deserve a little credit. Well, now ring MST3K. I'll admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was the reaction of many other veiwers as well. However, when I saw it for the second time, I realized that there was a great array of smart references and good fonts that I missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: Listen carefully! It takes a few times to catch each line. Give her a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 of 10.
