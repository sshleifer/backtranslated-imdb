I remember when this was in the theaters, the review said it was terrible. Well, I did not think it was that bad. It was fun and he had a lot of tongue-tied about families about holiday time. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a wealthy man who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. Goes to visit the house where he grew up and make a deal to rent a family there for Christmas. I really liked the sight of the lawyer where they signed the contract. It was funny. <br /> <br /> So, he makes ridiculous requests from the family to write texts for reading. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the benefit of love. He learns that holidays are not very bad after all. <br /> <br /> Also, everything that did doo-dah was funny, especially when they replaced the first with a black one, and my parents did not even do girlfriends to say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hunted on his "supposed daughter". Final Judgment: I thought it would be useful to check if I had picked it up on the cable.
