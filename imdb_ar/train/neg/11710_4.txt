There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not connected to a star or producer: actress Nicole Hiltz. It is the presentation in this slow-motion story and it is unlikely to be improbable. Directed by Simon Gournick, stars starring Joyce Heyzer as a treacherous wife who decides to take revenge on her cheating husband. Oh, but not by traditional means. She is planning a full-scale guerrilla war and recruiting the evil girl Nicole Hiltz as her favorite weapon. She wants Nicole (Tuesday) to approach her ex-husband (the handsome but dull Stefan Jenkins, who has to stick to music) to embarrass him and destroy his life. David Deloys is good in his short moments, and the former star "The Story of the Crime" Anthony Denison did nothing but do. Hiltz on the other hand, come at different times exciting and fun, then sinister and twisted. They also deal with the vulnerable and "perhaps a bit psychotic" well. It's also very hot (although there is no hooligan display), so you can understand how you might be able to reach anyone you target. But the performance is somewhat lost in this film, and it is not exciting or exciting enough to recommend it.
