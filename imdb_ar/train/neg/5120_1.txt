This is not a film, it is a 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon covered with the first sport in the United States, high school football. Another letter of long, serious messages that have been converted into converts is supposed to be released sufficiently by the spirit of going abroad and transforming their neighbors who have not been saved. <br /> <br /> A dialogue such as "You won the big message when Christ agreed" loses any potential attraction in the camp because of the disturbing density in the eyes of director Alex Kendrick sunken. Then there are "Proverbs". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it. Which do you think God blesses? This rhetorical question is aimed at predicting the miraculous climax, in which the coach asks his dreadful backhand, "Son, do you think God can help you do that?" It is a kind of entertainment that we could have expected to have faith-based faith funding if it was the hegemonic undertakings of the Christian Gospel administration around the world that convinced us to become "religious" after their example. Here is the boss of the poor giants in the terrible end, urging his team to cry "out with me!" While the religious eagles on the other side were walking quietly to do the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So, do you think our terrifying support makes his kick to conquer these centrist Galloutians? Well, we all know that fanatics can not lose. Put it like this: move the pitch to the Middle East desert, replace Christian evangelization, and can easily refill this tough nonsense as the tale of the Taliban versus the superpower, which faithful devotees in this garbage may wish to think about one minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they will not care, and do not need to: As the coach tells his team of serious empty ships, all the answers are here in this book. This Christian right will be devoured on its way to the rapture, the final victory they have made for their fields.
