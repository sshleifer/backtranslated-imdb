Why every horror director wants to imitate the movie "The Spooker" is a complete mystery to me, because the classic film "William Friedkin" is a highly exaggerated film, in my opinion, not all that tension or shock. However, there is another clean thing, one Spanish this time, shamelessly repeats the story of a little girl possessed by pure evil and turns against her family. Paul Naschy (whom I must confess to seem very hot here) plays the role of the celebrant priest John Gibson deals with because the behavior of his sister Lily has changed radically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest does not believe that, but when John's body is discovered in a crooked neck, Laila's demonic behavior becomes clearer ... "Exorcism" is not only not very original, it's also a very boring film! Here, Naschy and director Juan Bosch have an open chance to make the religious exploitation of the flick filled with shocks and infections, however, the result is a trivial, non-bloody drama in general you almost grow up! The last twenty minutes contain some moments in the air, though very stupid, and there are many nudity and females that were filmed in an elegant way. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse because Paul Nashachi has already demonstrated that he has enough imagination to make up for the lack of funds. This is just a terrible film, the end of the story. The other European "The Excorcist" Rip is the "Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door", and it sucks as well!
