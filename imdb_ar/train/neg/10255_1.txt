I got Christopher Lee, who has huge banks of computers in the 1970s that produce teletype noise. The letters appear on the screen. They contain radioactive isotopes that glow not only in the dark but emit exciting loud sounds and volcanoes! Evil aliens disguised as nuns! Tidal waves! Earthquakes! Explode cars! Coffee machines explode! As a climax, the entire planet explodes. How did this film succeed in being incredibly full, and mind-boggling? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of this film consists of creating footage, most of which includes long sections or an essay or a grouping, or sometimes three, do nothing but give the crew what to do. There are innumerable shots of our heroes driving, coming out and driving out, driving again, walking around looking at things, getting into cars and driving ... I sat there watching an endless parade of stupidity in stupidity murmuring, "Say something, from Please someone, just say something ... do something ... something! ... "<br /> <br /> Dialogue, when it comes, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe their minutes are measured on a scale different from ours." The line was usually meaningless. The script culminates in the destruction of the world through the stock footage, justified in this letter by me as the strange head: <br /> <br /> "The planet has unleashed many diseases, it pollutes the universe all the planets light years from here You will suffer unless you destroy it! <br /> <br /> This is the writing of the text of Neanderthal SF This is the type of motivation you find in movies of a kind that suits the Japanese monster in the 1950s and targets 7-year-olds. The most wonderful SF film in English since the retirement of Buster Crabbe The beggars believe that this film was issued in the same year that appeared in the movie Star Wars an d Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who always struck me as a smart and helpful actor with a firm knowledge of his limits, made his lines as if he would kill his client for a pile of Drake.
