A waste of my life, .... The manager must be critical. Why people feel they need to make worthless movies will have no meaning. When she finally died, he made me laugh. I had to change the channel several times throughout the film because I was embarrassed to see such a bad representation. Hopefully the guy who played Heath does not get to work again. In addition, I hope that the director will never get another film, and that his check will be refunded for this nonsense. {.02 of 10}
