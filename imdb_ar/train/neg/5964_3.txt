The version of this film I saw was "Horror Rising from the Grave". The horror in question is a wicked witch of the Middle Ages, played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Nashchi, who seems to be playing with Abnazer in the church hall. He rises from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as Naschy played) returns to his ancestral home and unites the magician's head and body, separated by the magicians who executed him, trying to stop him, eh, and rise from the grave. <br /> <br /> It is clear that once the head and body are back together, all hell breaks down and so many people die. Like all good witches, Abanazer here has a lovely helper. This is played by another great Spanish horror, Helga's beautiful line. Like every other woman in the movie Line, she gets her collection periodically. There is a lot of nudity in this film, not only for females - so we can see Naschi's horrible body, which is not a wonderful sight, I can tell you it. Most sex angle in the film is not justified. There is a particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to get a group of young and married blonde they own. <br /> <br /> It is also wonderful in some places - especially Herschell. The moment of Gordon Lewis-Esquire as her hands sink into a man's box to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the active zombies who reach the end. They are afraid quickly because of the fire and are not bothered to return. It is a shame. But the scene in which the zombie rises is the most ineffective moment in the film. All this happens in a long shot, and we have no idea what happens until we see some characters twist away. There are several moments of garbage like this, thanks in large part to the bad editing. When one of the workers falls under the hypnotized head of Naschi's head, there is a large proximity of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a great horror movie, but entertaining enough. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed American version that might have been cut into pieces. For all I know, the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
