Seriously, there is nothing good at all about this crap festival at all. Randolph Scott, a gay wardrobe who lived with his mistress Carrie Grant for twelve years, is the most wooden and boring in the least role. He is obviously 55 years old and far from these romantic roles, although it does not matter much here because Gail Russell looks older than 31 years old and is very ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and smoking. Marvin plays me his usual villain role but not enough to save this garbage. Praise be to Allaah. They no longer make westerners, they are only historians, and old racist films that fascinate guns and kill. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
