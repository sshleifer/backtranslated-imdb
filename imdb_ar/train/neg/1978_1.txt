Pathetic is the word. Bad behavior, pathetic script, interesting dialogue, hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell? The director of this film works just as badly as the film. If someone may take some time and effort to rephrase the whole thing, they may have a chance. I bet that the studios are still trying to figure out how they can get so rampant. <br /> <br /> The best thing ever was Stacey Dash ... The Asian chick was not so bad. These girls also carried the whole movie. If not for them I would have destroyed my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not waste someone who has not seen it yet and had an idea about it, do not waste your time ... you will only regret it later.
