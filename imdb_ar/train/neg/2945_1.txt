I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. He could not even make the movie fun. The only reason I saw it to the end was that I was studying video production and wanted to make sure that my students never did anything bad ... but it took all my intestines to sit with him. It's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... painfully painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the actual film, washed it in thinner paint, then saw it, it would be more enjoyable. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the trash in S-Mart, leave it as a snake.
