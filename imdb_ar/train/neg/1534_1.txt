From the simple digital stills to the acting that makes Keanu "I'm too rough and I can be Blancney," Reeves looks like an Oscar winner. The best thing about it is the eRATicate box in the second part (which seems to be among the three most powerful in terms of story and "evolution"). I wish I spent £ 3.99, it cost me something else, such as ERM .... Natural Born Killers: Director Cut. If you buy this, you are really in disappointment, do yourself an interest and avoid it like a plague. If you are looking for something with amateurs and with actors who are more rough than 2 × 4 then go ahead. However, if you want to make some high quality wolves elsewhere, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen and Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt.
