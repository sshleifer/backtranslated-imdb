I have written some notes here on THE POWER POWER, the killer of the vicious serial "Le Lambada Phillips" in 1990, the killer yuppie juggler hell-fest ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lu Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and He may spend some time in prison. I only hope he can find Armani prison clothes to go off with elegance. One of the guilty pleasures in this film is that the detective police are wearing tailored coats for $ 4,500, a $ 7300 silk suit, and a Los Angeles $ 3500 / With interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) Tracy Phillips has a wonderful ceramic skin and a flowing red hair that always appears even in mussels, and dazzling breasts lit in the second half of the film, designed by a sadly designed silk sweater that stays in place on her trunk even when She was preparing to sacrifice the devil. At least in the 1970s, Satanic killers took off their clothes before getting rid of them, although there is little to say about letting go of the imagination. In the last 10 minutes of the film, all I can think of is how her breasts will look. <br /> <br /> 3) Los Angeles-based professional psychologists can pay $ 4 million from apartments on the Mulholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide he was rude. In fact, the housing units used in this film seem to be exactly like those seen in the MULLHOLLAND DR of David Lynch, which at least had a good feeling of being resident in an apartment, a successful film director. Only the psychologists I met outside this film all serve a prison sentence for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name but the villain in this wonderful film, and his "how things go" 'boy friend? "line could be the best phrase to be ignored since" Thanks for the ride, lady !! " Of CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the big metropolitan cities there are huge basins of boiling acid that explode in huge fireballs if someone threw a lighter in a Zippo lit, which is why all public water station stations There are no signs of smoking stained everywhere, although the idea of ​​smoking around the water as dangerous is of course an unfair idea, and as Zippo lighters need to be filled with lighter liquid The idea of ​​carrying one in the pocket of the $ 7300 Gucci silk suit looks more dangerous to me. <br /> <br /> 6) The thrills in this film are impressive at the very least, One interesting thing about watching it is that you do not see computer-assisted special effects, but real-life people risk life and object to contributing to a movie that has earned almost a BOMB rating from critics when it's released. <br /> <br /> 7) I am always amazed by the Satanian movies: Here a man took advantage of some Luciferian attempts to gain power, and instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or making fashion models having sex with him for free, he instead He owns women's bags and makes them rise outside people's apartments. Here he speaks of an indestructible person who can fly and be able to put his presence in the bodies of others - yet he needs the star Le Diamond Phillips with a normal shot at the end of the film, but it is not good for Arnold Schwarzenegger or Apollo Creed to secure his victory. <br /> <br /> Day after day ... to be seen with wise friends drinking beer. You will have fun as long as you consistently refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
