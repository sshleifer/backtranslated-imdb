I loved the books of Henry James and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie released, based on the book's title. Jason Lee Jason is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play leading roles. Albert Finney is holding and does not carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or rather her silly role is unclear. The real problem and the lack of this latest release is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I was in the theater watching this long, boring film. There is more pause in the dialog than over Pinter Play. She felt in the book sponsored by Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like the development where her aunt had sex appeal to Maurice. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you can not sleep, it's a snooze. Do not watch it if you are depressed. You'll need Zoloft afterwards. <br /> <br /> Certainly, The Heiress was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor whose father played the mark as the mysterious cold father ... still grieves for his dead wife and hates Katharine for it. The film was not loyal to the book, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This was a box office window. I have no doubts about why.
