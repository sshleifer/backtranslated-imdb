I'm not sure if Carpenter looks forward to asking questions about abortion, and illustrates the really ruthless and clear point that women should be allowed to abort if the devil is the father, but it lasts. Ron Perlman is laughable. The child seems very stupid, he is basically a crab with a baby's head fixed on it. You can see pretty much the stuff on the devil costume. What a mess. This episode contains about five minutes of the story and 55 minutes of boredom. very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a bloody, bloody fuss? No! He puts his head down and comes out of the room. terrible.
