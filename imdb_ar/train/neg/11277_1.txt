There is no doubt that this film has impressive actors, but unfortunately, this does not help in the main negative aspects of the film. I do not at all understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use their own accents when it is clear to everyone that they can not convince them. Fiennes can not do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better than the Russian language. When the sound is wrong, no matter how well represented, the character will never be convincing. As for the main problem .... the plot .... there was one? I think there was some kind of story, but it was so full of holes that I could not wait for the film to finish ... It was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
