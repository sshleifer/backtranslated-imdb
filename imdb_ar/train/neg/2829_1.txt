The worst and fullest of people who should really know better, (the cast has six Oscar Awards). It was developed in Africa "Contemporary", (made in 1979), and related to slave trade. (Michael Mayn, Peter Ostinov, and William Holden reach a low level of career in this area) and are totally excited without any moral focus. They also conspired ironically. Do not think for a moment that any of the characters will behave the way they behave under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs but you leave the impression that he was over the phone. This is as bad as it gets.
