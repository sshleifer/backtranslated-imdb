I would not call it awful, but nothing shines at all in this film, and it is busy with some of the development of an unbelievable basic piece of land. It starts well, but once you finish a major hit, it turns into a long sub-piece about a little girl that is not convincing, and some movement scenes that are a theater of unreal mind. For example, there is a long shooting at the airport where the lighting is all turbulent. There is no explanation. How credible is it that the airport storage area will turn on lights that light up and close confusingly, and enough to allow the chips to do both? This is one of the very few traffic scenes interspersed with a set of stale processes that failed to attract one to the belief suspension. <br /> <br /> In addition, the full assumption seems to be that the CIA team in the United States can fire at the place but keep away from saying "national security" to the British. This control device relies on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are far better motion movies out there. Better formulation, better implementation. This game is sometimes entertaining but there is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes quite boring - something that should never happen in a good movie.
