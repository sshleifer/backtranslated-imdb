I was very disappointed by this film. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I was expecting a drama with a more intense character twist. But this never happens in the film. Daniel Dey Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some of the reviewers here might believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would like to make his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Representation: 6 out of 10 trend is 5 out of 10. The worst scenario is: 2 out 10. <br /> <br /> I Delete the movie from My DVR in 70 minutes. In the film. Movies are much better than this ...
