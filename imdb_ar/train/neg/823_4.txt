First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start the job. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman goes out to do some work for his masters, why waste nearly a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the arc of the story is no longer back anywhere, where we are simply shown that Hackman is under close observation and that anything he says or does knows is done by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more time of reunion is lost with his wife. All this had to take from 10 to 15 minutes at most simply as a setting for real and exciting contours and plot. At the time the real work begins, I was so bored that I just wanted to finish the film. Hakman is fabulous as usual, and other actors as well, but this is the boredom of the first size.
