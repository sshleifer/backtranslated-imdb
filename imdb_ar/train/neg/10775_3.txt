This movie is terrible! He competes with Ishtar in a number of embarrassing moments. I had rated them less than 3, except for a few funny lines; but, in general, this movie was crap! It looked as though they had done over the weekend at a bankrupt somewhere somewhere. Jo Ruth must join Elaine May on the sidelines of guidance forever!
