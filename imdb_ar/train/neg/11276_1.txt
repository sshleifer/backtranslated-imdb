I will not waste my time writing anything else about how every aspect of this movie is so bad. This has been done in great detail already, several times. The "plot" began as a broad-bearded boy / gangster who was not very inspired and quickly descended into complete chaos. Anyone claiming to be able to see some hidden masterpiece inside this terrible mess is just joking themselves. It has now been 7 or 8 years since he was seen in the cinema one week before his withdrawal, yet it remains in my mind that he is easily the most horror film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I only make these comments, and the only reason for my gold to watch the film, is an amusing fact that my brother Eide appeared as the second "heavy" in the bar scene. His hands were the ones that pushed the lighter towards the face of Rees Ivan in the tape in "Russia" (already filmed at the former holiday camp in Putin on the island of Bari). My brother has no experience in acting at all - he recently joined the plugins agency and this was the first part of it. After watching the film, it seemed that no one in the film needed any experience in acting. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the entire cinema - this was just two days after it was released. I have never heard of another unpopular film that has disappeared very quickly - and rightly so. If you're thinking of renting this movie on a DVD, I would recommend you instead to put the fire in your two-pound metal coins until they become hot, then jam them into the sockets of your eyes. This is probably less painful than watching the movie.
