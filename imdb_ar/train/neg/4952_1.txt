Well, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animation series, and even Batman Beyond. I even read Batman comic every now and then. So you can imagine - I was very excited when I heard about this series, then I was very disappointed. This series is nothing. Does not start in comparison with the original string. It's like a single long business game. No depth at all. And what the heck was with Joker? Which, in my humble opinion, is the best evil of Batman of all time and killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I wish I could say that there was nothing about this series that was creative or interesting remotely. In short (because believe me I can say much more) do not waste your time in this show, or your money.
