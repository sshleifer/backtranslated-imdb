And that's all there is to it. This thing is slow. The actors have the ability and do not seem to be excited about the effort. This plot is not big and is hampered by the above slowness. Accents, when they exist, are British. Uh, so many of these Danes are supposed to be well, well, not so important. But the language is. I do not think they used words like "yes" and "ok" on Beowulf Day. In this way supposed a cool weapon gave him his own? Did he reload this thing? Have you ever seen it? Or was Beowulf just a bad target? Well, his goal was at least consistent with the computer graphics used to generate monsters. Those were off too. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Only one I can think of. Marina Certis has held up well over the years.
