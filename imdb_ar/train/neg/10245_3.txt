I was expecting a lot from this film. Canada like me as a nostradamus like a caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring film. I can not even explain this film. He had a wooden representation, a terrible scenario of pieces of the Bible such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was in the end! The rest had to wait and I hoped something meaningful would happen, but it did not happen. The film revolves around a couple who are trying to spot changes in the world, such as places in China where there was an earthquake and ended up in a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery is ultimately the key to complications. The whole film is misleading and boring. One of the worst.
