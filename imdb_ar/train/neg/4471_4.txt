The best I can say about this film is that it was moderately amused at times and that it was a time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters. This is the kind of film that is beautiful, it hurts your teeth. I suppose the intentions were good, but things got stressful when the dialogue was nauseating. When both are not displayed on the screen, this is not bad at all, but be afraid during those repetitive moments when the lovable couple begin to talk to each other.
