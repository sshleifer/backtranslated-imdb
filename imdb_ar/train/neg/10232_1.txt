It's one of those bad dramas that it's almost so funny. The scenario is so terrible, terrible in its direction, it shines pure iron, the only thing that makes it come down from a very bad feeling is a good feeling is that the sound design is very bad does not add any The thrill of the story though it tries hard, but it does not destroy at least any sermons. There are problems of continuity of shooting seasons of shots all the time. Last but not least, the representation is appalling. As for professional production, he feels very much a university media project that should be regretted to anyone who has been forced to put their names on it.
