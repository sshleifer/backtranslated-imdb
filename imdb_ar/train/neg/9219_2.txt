I did not even know that this film was originally a TV movie when I saw it, but I guessed it all the time. It has the same washed colors, fine characters and horrible music I remember since the 1980s, as well as a "social platform" that practically screams "Afterschool special". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe (Thanks) was created at the height of Dungeons & Dragons, a RPG game with pen and pen that captures the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I consider myself one of those geeks, although I did not play the role of D & D specifically, I participated in one of her brothers. Mergers and acquisitions were also at the height of the main controversy in D & D - so much so that he was obsessed with losing touch with reality and worshiping the devil without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at some point, if it is very rare - but it is due to the history of this film horribly. <br /> <br /> We meet with 4 young college students, playing well called labyrinths and monsters, to get to know each other for a little time away from worldly life. Except that mergers and acquisitions as they are presented are more tedious than their mundane lives. No attraction is offered here - Jay Jay's request to move M & M to the "real world" comes from anywhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters crazy out of nowhere too - although at this point we do not really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different, but they are all rich from the wealthy WASPy who have problems that no one really faces. <br /> <br /> But things are going on and getting worse in many ways. The low budget is quite clear, (I love the sign of the "entrance" and the cardboard pieces on the forbidden caves) explains why Robbie / Pardu is not being a warrior in the most stingy scene at all, and rewarded for the top of the "two towers" unintentionally joking. Tom Tom Hans "miss" Jay Jay, what do I do here? "He made me laugh for a few minutes, certainly the low point of his career. <br /> <br /> Do not look at her like a convincing satire, just a funny piece of a TV trash can in the 80's, and you'll have a lot of fun. The majority is mostly boring, but it is worth it to break the Bardo in the end ... At least Tom Hanks has become better.You can not go much worse than here.
