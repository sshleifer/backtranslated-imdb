Take the flight from the mantle being the worst of a flick to Steven Segal that I've ever seen ... so far. <br /> <br /> It's a terrifying cavity with no interesting scene scenes, Seagal is not really trying on this - it's fat and his voice is called back. <br /> <br /> The position of participating stars will be no better, as a rather regrettable burden on the third mice. <br /> <br /> The Direction by Keusch is very poor and not surprisingly that he is also responsible for the other couple of stingy Seagal (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) film script co-written by Seagal himself incompetent. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M on this boring old tosh burden - if these figures are true, I feel there is a significant tax burden where no amount has been spent near this amount. <br /> <br /> In fact, the FLIGHT OF FURY is really a new shot of Michael Dudikoff's BLACK THUNDER flick - which should be better than this trip. <br /> <br /> This has no replace qualities at all, give it a miss! 1/2 * of *****
