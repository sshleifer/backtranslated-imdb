Words can not describe how bad this film is. I can not explain this by writing only. You also see it yourself to see how wonderful the film is. I do not advise you to do so. There are lots of cliches and mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) here that will make you cry. To start the technique first, there are a lot of errors related to the aircraft. I will not list them here, but I just remember the coloration of the plane. They were not even able to show a plane in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the form of an original Boeing. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done several times before, just much better. There are so many funny moments here that I lost a few of them early. Also, I was along with the bad guys all the time in the film, because the good guys were so stupid. The "executive decision" must be a choice for this decision, and even the "trouble" films are better. In fact, every other film in the world is better than this film.
