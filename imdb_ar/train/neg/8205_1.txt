Very bad representation, very shallow story. Not even a decent B movie, <br /> <br /> Events that were coincidental like the shock that humans encounter while riding on a foreign ship were very dull and lame. Sci-Fi I've seen in my life I've seen 5.0 stars and decided to watch it because I love this kind, but I suck it badly. <br /> <br /> Now there are very few good movies around the ALIEN theme, I think most are low budget <br /> <br /> Give it 3/10
