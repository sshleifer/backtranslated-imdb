Can I do this until I need glasses? At least proves the point at which anyone can make the film. Talent is not a consideration. People who unleashed this miserable pile of vomiting on the world lack any form of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should consist of newly identified children and infants who play with their faeces. Anyone else would be far from wise in the world to get even a snicker from this movie. It consists of a series of yellow plays in which the punchline does not extend to what is evident. And ends in fucking. The jokes that are listed are the kinds of jokes that elementary school children (usually potty or sexually related) tell they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like those revolving around a father's car and a garage mother. The application of any strict method of criticism would be futile, because the usual standards of behavior, writing, direction and the like were unheard of by the creative "minds". Behind this mess. It should not be a judgment, but anyone who enjoys this film should seriously think about his goal on this earth. <br /> <br />
