Anyone who said it was better than Hostel talking complete crap, believe me I'm not a Hostel lover but this is ridiculous. This is just another screenshot of the camcorder, straight to the DVD, low in ideas that waste your time, I can not believe the number of these movies, I have not seen a movie yet fit. In the 1880s, Gore and Horror movies were produced without a budget but a wonderful story and a host of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had what he says. Now they seem to be pumping in an attempt to trick people who are browsing the blockbuster to hire a copy, so people stop doing it then I think these movies will still appear. This film is very low in ideas, it's amazing how it was made at all, as the acting was terrible, the location is not quite convincing and the soundtrack is very disturbing because it is a beggar's belief. This time loss does not have anything at all, unless you seek to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the film is when a female character shows a gun and threatens to shoot him if she does not back down, you can see that she does not even cover the operator with her finger, just hold the grip. An absolute joke.
