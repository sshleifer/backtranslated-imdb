That is why Jane's show will not work. Again, Canadian producers and writers in the bone-marrow industry can not create a sitcom without putting on a different type of rotation. I think these people do not see much of T.V. From the United States that has a sitcom model below the pat. No, here we have to do something different, and we make the story of A completely silly and then we have a meaningful B story to try to compensate for. 2D characters and story lines in the foreground: Forklift races ??? Give me a break. Here's a little advice for the show book, do not write funny positions, or look for ridiculous things in positions. And remember, you must be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, not just improvisation monkey.
