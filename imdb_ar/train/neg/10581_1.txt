There was not one original idea in this story. The subjects were drawn from various sources; some were the ninth gate, the madness mouth (another carpenter's film), and the ring. But went further than showing the same glittering shiny circle of The Ring and used it as the film's name. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was released from Suseberia. We hope that no one will object to this comment by putting the word HOMAGE around it. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Deppreto Deep Reed. The allegation of honoring the cop will be bullshit. This was down the barrel. Throwing the shots and "disturbing" images into the pot does not make a good horror film. Carpenter used to know it. It must fade into mystery or get a time machine.
