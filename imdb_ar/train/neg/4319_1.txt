Sorry, but I will spoil both the plot line and the end for you in the hope of avoiding the failure to leave like the ones I am facing now. The father died and the mother asked Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... Santa does. Abu Khohei, happy healthy and not fully aware of the fact that he died. Everything ends ends. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently saw my five-year-old friend lose his best friend in dogs, it was like a flick. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring back his friend is to ask Santa! Does not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - is not convinced by some conviction that it was just a film and that his dog will not return for Christmas. It was sad to watch his joy just to know that on Christmas Eve he would have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> Shame on you on behalf of all the faithful who recently lost a loved one. It is difficult to deal with the one-time loss of the child, but there are some desires that we should not even portray as a possibility.
