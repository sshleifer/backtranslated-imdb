Despite so much elegance, flash and luster, this French musician fails to speak. Frequent, predictable and boring melodies. The story is interesting as well as many characters. <br /> <br /> People break into song and dance without motivation or reason. Most of the characters wear a false wig and a wig, and the groups appear hopelessly bound. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video was stopped from the restored version before the end, which had a negative impact on me. Definitely a shame, that you have such a talented multiplayer in a very weak effort. <br /> <br /> I go to the show, I think, where follow-ups are often tracked (in this case, for the great classic, "umbrellas"). One can not restore, only re.
