Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was so well represented by the smell of a woman, who seemed to have overdosed on himself irreparably. I hope this film, which I have heard almost nothing, is a nice little gem. The city's political play has been overlooked, innovative, interesting and attractive. it's not like that. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film interspersed with plots of many "real" city figures, names and issues that you believe are a wide-ranging conspiracy, once you discover the truth and will blow your mind. Yet, in fact, these sub-conspiracies and exclusivity eventually produce fairly familiar storytellers, such as Corruption of Power, double-sided politicians, police-related mafia, and so forth. In theory, this setup allows for some exciting tension. I fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything can happen! But again, this does not really happen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are completely predictable, and we have many "recognized" monologues, which aim as a whole to form a modern tale of some kind, studied the moral ambiguity in the "real world" From politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and the spider web of lies and cover-up, the audience is usually treated with somewhat pathological disclosure. I do not think we left it in the city hall, and while it was a full movie, I did not find it quite rich.
