The most positive thing I can say about this boring "comedy" production is that it is not aggressive. In fact, it is surprising that one wonders about the number of dozens of rewrites prepared by the Commission and passed through this complete removal of personality. It is not ingenious, nor amusing, nor insightful, nor charming. It's just a loser, without a laugh, for four losers who have to change their ways - and their attitude towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding. <br /> <br /> Through acting, it will be sub-level amateur amateur drama community, a very tired landline, makes the forty-third season of "Alo" Alo seems refreshing, joking about humorous like watching decaying vegetables, however , Sion Wedding recorded ten nominations in the New Zealand Film Awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone saw the meaning and did not win anything.
