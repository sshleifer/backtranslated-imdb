"Scary Movie 2" is letting down to a scary film franchise. The scary movies 1, 3 and 4 were good, but the genre was boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they chose their film after that and made two terrifying films. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around a group of teenagers who are deceived by their professor to go to a haunted palace for a night. Things start to go wrong, then realize that they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible but it could have been improved from a few things. It's very fun, and if you liked other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, give this watch a watch - but I do not think you'll like it much.
