Start with the good thing: Several times Swayze speaks to the Zulu with his friends or that language you hear between tribes. It's a wonderful feature, where audiences in the United States and the United Kingdom believe that all people on this planet speak English (only if you're one of them: no, no). <br /> <br /> But the representation is "tenenkrommend" as we say in the Netherlands (makes your toes curl - not in a good way). I love Swayze but this is awful. The muscles in his jaw increase the extra time he expresses the whole movie - no one must have told him that it seems painful. No Patrick: It seems ridiculous and makes up for the lack of personality. Alison Doddey (Elizabeth) has chosen a method of acting that does not meet her colleagues' style of work. Her representation is very comfortable because it was possible to set this film in the current days. This is not the case. Your dress was an idea, Allison. <br /> <br /> The best representation of people from the African continent and Sided Onyulo came as the best ampouba. Clear, warm and personal, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: It's fun on a rainy day. Pity. Do you own the best. Sacking the director.
