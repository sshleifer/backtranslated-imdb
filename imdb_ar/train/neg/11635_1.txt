Well, this review will be short and attractive ... something the film should have done, and make his life shorter and smoother than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason to have a petition with more than 40,000 signatures, all of which are asking Uwe Boll to stop producing films from franchisees that people like. Blood Rayne being a Baiji there. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you have never heard of them many times before. The representation is going down but you can not actually blame the text in it. Until a few moments I wonder if they are using a script. <br /> <br /> The movie has nothing to do with the original games. Hi, if you play games, I know that the main character has no real motive outside the murders, such as mass murder because he stopped a toe or similar. There is too much story for such a stupid film. As I said. I will not steal this film. For someone who says this is a "funniest 2007" we should take a look at it, and the news is better than this.
