You can name this one flop, this is a very big one too! Quality is not associated with the words National Lampoon, but at least the Vacation and Animal House entries were fun, but this should be the most unusual feature you've ever seen. Ugh! This three-part story attempts to parody the Hollywood clichés and stereotypes that turned out to be completely insane and malicious. <br /> <br /> "Grow yourself". - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decided to leave his job and split with his wife so that both could grow and do what they always wanted to do. This is life, as Jason sees it and takes care of the children, but his decision to follow this path may not be the right one. <br /> <br /> Talk about bullets, boredom and cruelty. There is only real interest in the small performance of the beautiful Linn Lin. The cynical element here seems to point to something rather than simply conveying it. Humorous humor is tense, flat and especially meaningless. Peter Riegert maintains a very impenetrable role in the lead role and the bubbles of Terezel Ganzel in her role. <br /> <br /> "Successors" - After the collage, Dominique Courser gets a stripper job and is raped with some butter by the heads of the dairy company. In order to recover, I became interested in the margarine industry, and it is almost on its way to the top. "<br /> <br /> Probably the best of the three, but the competition was not too big, you want to be smarter with her sexual accent But the feeling is promising and creative to build upon, but the weak speed begins to fade away in the end and the disastrous dialogue I do not do anything at all, humor tries, but often does not bear fruit, on Despite hunger, Ann Dusenberry is very seductive and cool and manipulates all the time (after a while A long time of painful ordeal) and he likes to hide it gracefully. The worn-out clothes of the stripper seem to get a full rehearsal for the opening half of the story, appearing in an amusing little game that ranged from Dick Millar, Mary and Ronoff, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Kolb, and a favorite role of Joe Spinell. > <br /> <br /> "The Municipalities" - a serial killer who leaves copies of his driver's license behind him after each murder, is followed by an eagerly naive young cop and his old partner, yet the young policeman learns that rigor is the only way to go, One by one. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh ya. Make sure you spoil something too great, make sure that laughter will flow from its place. Obviously they forgot it! Even in 30 minutes in a row, the boy does so drag! Robbie Benson's disgusting demeanor became overbearing with Richard Weidmark, who only worked with his partner. Christopher Lloyd relies on the role of serial killer, but his wobbly and sympathetic performance works well and largely shows the other lines. Featuring Elisha Cook Junior, Rhea Perlman and Harry Reims. When the jokes come, they really feel that they are not synchronized and are somewhat stymied by their repetition of the irony of these clichés. <br /> <br /> In general, dumb materials decorated with their representative imperfections can be disposed of as disposable materials. The unbearable script is basically incompetent and unwise. Only one or two gags make them every slice, but in fact there are plenty of cheap stink products or simple verses that hang in your head. This is because it becomes practically what he tries to make fun of him and this is mainly shown in every story. He loses sight. The offerings range from hot and cold, but who can not deny the embarrassment that most faces feel. Bob Giraldi's first taste is a taste of "growing yourself," but "success seekers" have shown some light prosperity. Henry Jaglom does a well done job on the "municipalities". Rick Meyeritz's vibrant graphics, which open the film, are carefully created and continue to adjust style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-eyebrow comedie is floundering by exaggerating, with the main attention the pattern draws from familiarity. But in fact, it is worth the traffic in this lame labyrinth and troubled awakening, just to discover them. Well, it's up to you.
