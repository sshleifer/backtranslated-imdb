Interestingly, 90% of high-rating reviews consist of a "* random user name *" of the "United States" (ie, pride country ??) who all say exactly the same thing or less in the same exact grammar style and all with no Full taste in movies. I would like to go into this suspicious direction, but unfortunately, this is a review of the film and not the reviews itself. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am a Christian and a real thirsty film. That means I've seen a lot of movies, from good to bad, and I can honestly claim that confronting the Giants is not really a good film. She has good intentions, but fails to meet many of the basic criteria (if any) that she has attached to a high-quality cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The Acting: Most Most Terrible, Palatable At Best. Hearing that most of them are volunteers does not seem to surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the script is written as a long copy of a comic play similar to what you see in a Sunday school or young group post. Rave Review Robots is revealed in the absence of "meaningless words", but the harsh cold truth is that such words are part of the real world, and their total absence is obvious. Let's just say that the first coach of the team leader in the state championship game will have a lot to say more than "OH NO!" When things do not go their way. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: The mind can be predictably puzzled. It has been commented that this film is not Hollywood Clich√©, yet it seems to have been pulled directly from the film "Making Androgy Sports" for the dolls (including the semi-romantic female sub-plot) and was just a Christian film coat of paint slapped on it . I do not lie or boast when I say that I have almost all the major details in both the plot and the sub-plot that were linked once they were created. Only the person who has never seen a mathematically appropriate film in his entire life will be emotionally encouraged by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> Output / Edit: It, too, is fully designed after Underdog Sports is almost a general movie template. However, looking at our side, there was not a lot of lofty loopholes, so at least the Giants face was technically competent. <br /> <br /> Mission: Ask Jesus and he will give all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this film would finally end up defeating the team to really emphasize the part "If we lose, we praise you" because in the real world it will fail at one point or another and it is good to be prepared for it. But in the world of "confronting the Giants", if it fails, it is clear that someone has cheated or cheated. Another interesting question is, what if the Eagles encountered another team that got the religion? Will they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and saved at the last minute, or was the universe simply burst? <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: For the hard-line conservative conservative Christian crowd, the film "Facing the Giants" will be a medium-sized Christian film in the best possible way to stand on the pedestal as a favorite model of modern art making the film. For anyone else, the effects will range from boredom and cravings to something else. And a warning: any attempt to show this to non-Christians will not lead to transformation, but to irony. I gave these two stars, one to the scene that did not push me to roll my eyes, and the other to basic technical efficiency with a low budget.
