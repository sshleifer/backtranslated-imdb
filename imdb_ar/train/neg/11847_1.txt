I am appalled at how bad this film is. As a kind of Hollywood artist in the early 20th century, they set a new low - even the Last The Moderns or (Caspad) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I could see a film worse than these 2. They were given in a slightly different environment & period. However, the intentions and results were painfully similar. <br /> <br /> First, there is a terrible situation: Eddie Isard in the role of Chaplin? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe this man something? Jennifer Tilly as Lola Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davis ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even start trying to take a picture or sound the period they are allegedly filming. <br /> <br /> Well, the Last Photo Gallery was a good movie, but this was a disaster & the rest of the Bogdonovich pics were not much better. Guess rub against Welles & Hitch & Ford wore a long time ago. Still good to host TCM though.
