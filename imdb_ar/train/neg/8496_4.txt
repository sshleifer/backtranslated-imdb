Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of wide shots? No? me too. Well, I finally saw one section in "Spring in my hometown", I must admit, and now I know why people do not do this. This technique is "arty" certainly, but it certainly is not ripe for public consumption. This technique is severely flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and this may be the intentions of the entire director. I do not know, I can not read the minds, and certainly do not know enough about the director to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing is clear about this film is painfully clear which is ridiculous. Anti-American sentiments. As an American, I am well aware of my country's involvement in the Korean War, and I am well aware that we have not always been angels, but I would be damned if I took this version of this man about how things went. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only out of war, we were the cause of war, and we destroyed the country individually. Whatever, master manager. I assume that you are still making this film in communist Korea if we do not intervene, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is closer to making the Nazis "good people" with the conversion of the Allied forces to the "bad guys". This film is historically na√Øve and in fact inaccurate so that it is almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes his strong presence to American intervention, he will certainly have a great deal of strength and merit.
