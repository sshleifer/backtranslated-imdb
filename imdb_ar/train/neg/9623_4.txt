Ben Stiller does not act as a reaction. And do it well. It depends heavily on the comedy that revolves around it. In There's Something About Mary, the hair styling scene works only because the Stiller tries to keep a straight face. When he confronts the other suitors for Mary, he is the most unusual man in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stellar is surrounded by a range of comedy talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are very few. Having said that, Hoffman relies little on physical humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to fart jokes to make you laugh. The scene of the basketball where Hoffman yells is exaggerated (although he casts a stalemate in the form of a shirtless opponent with a smile - notably through Stellar's reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Steller could play a big role. Aniston once again plays her role as Rachel, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more than a "Joey with a crush on Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a homogeneous rom-com game and this failure - it lacks the heart. You do not root for the characters. With a little more work, we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure was due to bad writing. Worth watching if it appears on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret pulling money to see it.
