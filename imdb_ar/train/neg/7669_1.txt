This film has been one of the most unique films I have ever seen. But this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails for this mess. It seems like a series of challenges that have been set to determine whether you want to get out of the movie or not and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to be frustrated, you'll see this terrible movie and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved. They've all seen better days, but you know they've already got so much money. To do this, you will lose pity for them just like you already did for the movie. I can not go on talking about this terrible film, it was something that Ed Wood could have done, and in that case it would certainly have been a masterpiece for him. <br /> <br /> To start, you have to sit through the open dialogue you have never seen before, this should be five minutes long. Moreover, it has been narrated, as suggests that the viewer can not read. Then we met Mr. Slater and carried out a whole lot of horrible lines, as if he were just working to get lines to the label of the movie poster. Soon we meet Stephen Dorf, whom I usually enjoy. He does his best not to drown in this, but in the end he does. Then comes the extreme insult, Tara Reid plays a smart role, help us! Tara Reed is not a very talented actress, but she constantly gets roles in films, in my opinion even though she must adhere to films of the American pancake type. <br /> <br /> All in all you may just want to see it yourself when it is shown on a video, I know I got a kick from it, I mean it allows everyone to be honest here, sometimes it is so comfortable enjoying the disadvantages of others .
