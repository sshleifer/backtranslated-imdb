First of all, this film reminded me of the old films I used to see in the classroom of religion at school. This is not a good thing. Basically, it's just a piece of preaching and humility, just like the dreaded "Left Behind" series. I do not feel insulted by religious films ... but I feel insulted when these religious films are so horrible. I just want to say nice things about a Christian film, but it does not seem to happen anytime soon. I bet if Bible experts are given an appropriate budget, they are still unable to reach anything good. Just avoid this one. Well, the fact that the American Family Association (mainly the pastors and the Eldon lacks) notices about this film on their website is another reason that makes me hate it. In fact, after seeing this, I went home and saw my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 "Crash". Forgive me, my God, for I have sinned. Hahaha!
