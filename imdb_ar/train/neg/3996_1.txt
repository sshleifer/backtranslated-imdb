I do not see what everyone liked about this film. The setting was very long and modern, and when it was finished, the main character remained flat and opaque as it was in the first scene. After the movie finally reached Cusack in the hotel room with a name, I had to wonder, well, what would happen here in the next hour or so to keep me connected. Answer: Not so much, only John Kozak has a long mental breakdown, perhaps if Kosak's character is deeper. . Perhaps if his whims were a comprehensive reworking of his everyday life. . . Perhaps if the film had better developed its half-hidden themes about loss and faith or did not address it in the first place. . . Maybe if the film had chosen to be either terrifyingly terrifying or terrifying, it would have embraced one of these methods. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the worrying episode at the edge of the hotel, the mad lady with the hammer, the stupid film guard in the air duct, which represents three of the more than five minutes of the screen time, was a thrilling movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here for a less powerful effect. Has Stephen King now turned to stealing ideas from himself?
