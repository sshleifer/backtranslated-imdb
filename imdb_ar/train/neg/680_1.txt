I finally caught "Starlight" last night on TV and all I can say is. . . Wonderful! It's hard to know where to start - the incredible special effects (see Willy's laser rays!), Horrible representation, massive dialogue, the uneven use of stock clips, or the blunt atmosphere of the whole production. It is truly a unique experience, and we must thank everyone for it. My name is Jonathan Kay and the real heir to Ed Wood!
