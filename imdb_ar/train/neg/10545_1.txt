An unpleasant experience. Improvised dialogue, portable cameras without any effect, plot without direction, romantic invoked, ick to the whole mess. Ron Silver was the only real actor. It was a terrible Saakchi Greta! Henry Jaglom achieved better performance with food that suited his style much more.
