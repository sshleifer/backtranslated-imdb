I commented on this when she first appeared and gave her a "wonderful" review, noting that I would give her the benefit of doubt after the first episode only. I've seen a total of six episodes so far in June 2006. As a fanatic Batman lifelong, I can say without hesitation: this offer is totally nonsense. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with it. everything. The past has gone beyond mere bad animation and design. The stories are ridiculously devoid of personal development or a clear interest on the part of this book to give any content to any stories. <br /> <br /> For God's sake .. Is it just me, or is Joker in every episode? Is Gotham the rotten judicial system? Or again, it is just a complete lack of interest in the book to make any effort in the other bad guys (see "No Personal Development", above). <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same as the three-part version. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker threatens people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker begins to invade the entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode I saw that was not the story of Joker. The title escapes me, but the villain was that villain Cluemaster ... "Think Thank Thunk" episode with the show contest. It was Batman's worst story that I saw, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I've got Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I feel in this show because it might be against "ToS", but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thank God for having Tim / Dini / etc. The era of entertainment pat, back from the days of Fox and WB children. Things are good, I should have known this, just can not last forever, unfortunately.
