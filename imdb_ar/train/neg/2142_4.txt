If you're under 6 or 7, you'll really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when you watch him. As an adult, I can not stand! I am all up to the sequel .... when they have a decent story. But this is nowhere near the level. Please allow me to show a film after each child, but when you have to sit around it almost every day when your kids love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter was watching this movie again and again on the same day if we allowed it to. <br /> <br /> This movie has been given 4 out of 10 for the fact that it keeps the smallest entertaining.
