This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not see how this can be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? It's more like a trance drama. The scary music is excellent but due to the lack of any scary situations, the director thought it would be good to use them in everyday activities such as indulging or walking in the stairs. The film had a lot of potential. They had a beautiful cinematography (sp?) And interesting characters, but it seemed as if the book assumed you already knew them. They would be subjected to strange activities without explanation or even an idea of ​​what they meant. This is simply one of those movies that says about one thing which is quite different.
