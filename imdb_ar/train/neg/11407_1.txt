This film is a perfect example of an excellent book destroyed by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no story, conspiracies disappear, and terrible editing. Up everything, the music is directly synthesized, and it looks incredibly awesome. The representation in Bridget Fonda is decent, but everyone else behaves perfectly. I would like to suggest this film to someone studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a film because it is full of bad scenes, bad transformations and representations that should have been reprinted! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
