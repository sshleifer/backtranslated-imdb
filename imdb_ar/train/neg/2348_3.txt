Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first role in the tournament, shows her rebellious nature in real life in the slow-moving women's soap opera. Wow, is this a way of political health and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a strong feminist in real life, she must have been proud of this scenario. No wonder the left wing critic Roger Ebert loved this film. He is right in his political schism as well. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad that Jude made her way out of this heinous blot to better roles in the movies she enjoyed, and did not herald the liberal agenda.
