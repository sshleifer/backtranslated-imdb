After hearing the rave about this film for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the lease was free from the local library. This was a slow, tedious and unrealistic step and the plot was not meaningful. Two hours later, you are ready to restrict that city that is located in Texas and put a group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is personal, but believe me, I do not understand all the hype I heard about this film. Dallas made good details about life in Texas like this movie. Just hire it if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that the bad movie is good.
