I think the PG-13 crap was overpriced! Brittany Snow's performance was at least good, and others like Idris Elba did well, but some of the other teenagers at the prom like favorite friends were not hooded. The murderer was very stupid and looked very stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unfamiliar. The film was very boring and very overpriced. It was not impressive at all, I was asleep. Another PG-13 bad edition, it's really a scary film about IMO. The end was very stupid and rushed rushing and very boring. The film is very slow too. Overall, the only good thing about this festival is Brittany Snow and I think they performed well and Idris Elba too, but besides that it was a totally awful film and the latest awful movie. Well that's just my opinion. I gave him 2/10.
