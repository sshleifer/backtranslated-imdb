This movie deserves another bad review. Keep in mind that a reviewer praises the movie's virtues that include "not having sex, violence, or injustice." Ah excuse me that the preparation of the film has made us see him as a young friend of Cody, with the love of life and who has everything to live for him in the blown bits leaving Cody holding his bloody body without life. Given the nature of the war, we know that Cody saw horror almost daily. For those who watch this film with rosy glasses, the violence that defines Cody's personality is erased from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Without any Cody family, like John Rambo, the country roams its bike to make the long trip to the birthplace of the United States under the guise of what is called the city of Nevada. No mention, no recognition of the obvious fact that Cody is the damage of goods. We have known this since CO announced in practice that he ordered Cody to "get some rest" away from the death and destruction of the war. This explains, as nothing seems to notice or care about, the clear "flat" codei effect. It's not bad to act. This is the flat effect of PTSD. Do not guess here, remember that CO ordered him out of the battlefield. <br /> <br /> What about that "occasional" kiss as you notice another review. The fall was an accident, and the kiss was not. To what extent did Cody respect her faith by beating her knowing full well that she was talking about her? Now that was a non-family value moment. A moment that is then announced to the immediate universe as if it were posted on YouTube. Of course, the magnificence of faith and sincerity of Cody for a woman planning to marry another woman is greeted with the spirit of the Christmas season, all chanting with her heart and lips. <br /> <br /> We do not know anything about Feith's fianc√©e, but she is fond of him. It does not take more than a second to accept his suggestion (he could have waited if there were any other ideas), he is decent, loves her to death, and The family has something against him, he thinks the marriage is based on compromise and the two have not yet discussed plans for marriage. There are no evil agents here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a good actor presented during the hill dialogue like "We love you, my son ...." "You're part of our family" literally days after meeting a stranger named Cody. And the "Brotherhood" speech, where the phrase above all was never meant to apply to outsiders outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This movie is a cotton candy Christmas fluff that betrayes itself in major ways. When she praises Cody's lack of respect for faith by beating her physically with her full knowledge as she speaks of her. By redefining the family as we know it, you have to accept a virtual stranger as a whole loving member of the family because we all "love you". How many of you did that or knew who did it. Not.
