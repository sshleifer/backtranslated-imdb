God, what a terrible thing! Maybe Oliver Stone wanted the experience or something like that (see the terrible use of music and photos here) but what about the truth? The reason for the "naturally born killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how the media can turn into a complete trash can, but unfortunately the film turns into dust. Please Mr Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of TV shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Hank cleverly said of this film that he condemns media fascism in cinematic fascist ways. How true ... just forgot to tell us about the tremendous headache you get after sitting in this long load of crap!
