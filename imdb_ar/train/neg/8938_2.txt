I still can not believe how bad this film is. If I'm not a public science specialist, I do not know if I'll keep watching. It seems that it costs about $ 1000, but it was not the money that drove them down. The acting was terrible - not just bad, the third graders read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason to watch this type of film is the skin, which is largely lacking in this click. We could not even see the more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Well, luck better next time eh?
