I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was absurdly exaggerated. Most actors spoke as though they expected your nine-year-old nephew to speak if he pretended to be a crooked policeman, or a wicked, very evil villain. Sounds like coarse sums amateurs for me. I can go to buy a cheap blender and want to open better music. And what about all the police torture in 1984? It was totally unnecessary and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, it seemed to be really wonderful, but nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment because one of the things that make Borges stories very good is its simplicity - they are tightly bound, without redundant details. This film is quite the opposite. She stopped watching after the scene in which Lonnrot interrogated the man from Yidische Zaitung, or around him. I have wasted 4 dollars to rent this, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully save others from making the same mistake.
