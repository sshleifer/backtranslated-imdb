Recipe for one of the worst films of all time: The male villain who seems to have escaped from the WWF, has a terrible target with a gun with inconsistent effects (the first man who shoots him in flames but when you shoot anyone else they only disappear) It takes some time for deer pets. Then I got unwanted characters, college students who are 30 years old, a lame attempt at a sudden end and many others. Avoid at all costs.
