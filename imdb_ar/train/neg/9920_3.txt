I love Clash music and love Joe Strummer and Mescaleros. I went to this movie hoping to find out the guy behind it. But I came out of the theater and did not know much about Joe anymore than I knew after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The film never reaches the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect their small items, shaky videos and interview some people about Joe Stromer in a camp fire. It turned out that most of these people knew him very little or did not know at all, and that the director wanted them only in the film so some celebrities say, "Oh, it was an inspiration to all of us." Such as Bono or Johnny Depp (who seem to have asked to keep his pirate costume to take advantage of his current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not wait to cool the body before jumping to sell his novel "The Greatest Rock in the Heart" that they have ever lived and sanctified the person without really knowing it enough. <br /> <br /> Certainly, as a fan, I enjoyed seeing the band's pictures and hearing stories behind the songs and the like, but in the end I felt as if I had stayed Joe Stromer's picture in 60-90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go to the movie if you are a fan, otherwise listen to some music in Clash or even better than the unwanted Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, dissolving all his influences Rich together with one amazing voice.
