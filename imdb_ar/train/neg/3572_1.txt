"Z" in Los Angeles featured Pia Zadora after about six months or so from "Butterfly". I had high hopes for the actress, then moved from bad to WORSE clearly in this film. <br /> <br /> Once again, it was in the 1980s that he told you that Harold Rubin's work had been lost by a smarter book. In the late 1970s, Jackie Collins came to make women stronger for men in everything in her books, and even more So. That is why this smell work. Harold Rubin's work in the 1980s was not filled with crowds. It was Pia Zdora who was working in a robin business like throwing kerosene on fire. The support team was also not supportive. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... this was a bad look then and even after 20 years, it looks worse. I had hope for Pia as an actress, and all got fired when it was done. It would be difficult for Pia to recover herself as an actress (although John Waters had her picture in "Hairspray" was a spark) although she enjoyed a nice lyric. <br /> <br /> Hi Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray may go on tour! Join the exhibition may be the biggest story of the return after. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you if you do.
