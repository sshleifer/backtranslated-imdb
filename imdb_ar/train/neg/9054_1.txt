If you hate the reciting dialects, you will hate this movie. To make matters worse, Patrick Sawyce sees himself as being behind. I really can not stand backward accents. I love Billy Bob Thornton, I've been good at Slingblade, but it was disturbing in this film. What kind of name is Chromatic Earl? How much of this Hickey can this movie get? The story was stupid. I usually do not judge this film, but I could not bear this movie. If you want a good movie from Billy Bob Thornton, go to Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 in Wal-Mart characters ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. Maybe I can not stand on the lagging dialects normally, or I can not stand Patrick Sweezy. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not there. I did not laugh once in the film. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they showed that the fingers were breaking, she laughed. People's fingers crashed by chance always makes me laugh.
