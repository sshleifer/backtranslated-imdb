I try to be very objective when I watch a film with a low budget. I can also apply less weight to independent, low-budget productions versus large budget productions. I expect to be free of defects from their big budget productions and their studios. So I apply stricter standards to major studio releases. But this film was just a hoax. interval. The premise was awful. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a high school student and had an indomitable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or acting that drove you into her world. Also, to make this film more mysterious, lighting has not added to certain mood scenes, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Once again, another disappointing film that I can only give three points.
