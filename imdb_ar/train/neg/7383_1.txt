I feel blessed to have what is known as Steven Seagal's worst film ever. I knew I was something special when Stephen opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. By the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt and I was about to drop out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven Stephen (in a constantly changing voice) is completely implausible in his role (as always). Who is the hell that allows people who have tailed silky ponytails to enter the troops anyway? He also writes always in love interests with absolutely incredible women for at least 20 years. All the supporting actors seem to have been photographed in the dark - BTW, have they filmed this movie in the dark using only a torch? <br /> <br /> This is really hateful in every way possible. Invite all your friends around you and make a social event - this really special event.
