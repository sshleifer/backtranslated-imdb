The scene of a group of screenwriters sitting around a table, one of them "lets a black woman approach an unexpected person from the audience (black too) in the street and ask him if he's black, then go away." The other writers drop hysterical laughter until someone suggests that they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is funny, and the presentation has many types of situations, you will enjoy this offer. For the rest, use a zapper and look for something more entertaining like watching dry paint. Those who wrote glowing reports about this show should either go out more or be forced to watch funny TV comedy movies. Another example of humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of the push when out of the supermarket by trying hypnosis for the cashier. Funny marginally the first time but why repeat it over and over in different offers with different cashiers? I can offer other examples, but these examples may be treated as spoilers, which reveals why this comedy is not funny at all.
