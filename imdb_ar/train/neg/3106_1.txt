When I create a list of the worst movies I have ever seen, this movie is always on it. It has no replacement qualities at all. It took the will to sit in everything, and I soon shed my blood instead of having to sit back. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to the Midnight Show, on a Saturday night. I am the only ones in the theater who are myself, and a handful of noisy, unruly, noisy teenagers sitting somewhere behind me. Obviously they were having fun on a Saturday night, and they attended this "comedy" for some laughs. Before the film began, during the interviews, they were laughing, joking and making comments loudly after a long time. It was annoying borderline; if they continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the actual film, I might have said something, but I felt tolerant and sympathetic to the pleasure of their soul, so I let him go. They settled as soon as the movie began. <br /> <br /> Why tell you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" in terms of the impact it has brought not only on myself, but on this bustling group. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, no one in the theater laughed. Not once. Not me, not noisy children. Absolute silence, regardless of sound. When the film ended and the lights went on, we all emerged, slowly, from the theater in silence, slow, silent and absolute. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect of this comedy. Not laughing, not enjoying, but absolute. It was a frustrating and frustrating film, not the smallest funny thing. Preaching, self-indulgent, and depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I consider Milks Brooks "Burning Saddles" to be on the shortlist for the movie Finest ever. It still drives my mind to the point that the guy himself could be responsible for Least Funny at all. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel happy, give this movie a whirlwind; otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
