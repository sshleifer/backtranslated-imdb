Maybe this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that she has a flimsy story is bad enough, they have linked the subject of violence in football makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this film even before I began watching, but I entered his mind open enough to accept the way the book saw fit to introduce the character of Elijah Wood died in the scene of the rioters. <br /> <br /> But the film aims at inaccuracy after inaccuracy, for the point that makes everyone in the middle of the film make you crumble harder than before. <br /> <br /> Let's get rid of some things: rioters do not tend to break their own bar before almost running the league game and do not go off to kill each other. They do not just wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, rioters or not, they do). Sure, they do not, when they excite a new member of the company, rush to the territory of their competitors to get pie and mash. I like to meet the idiots who will go and live at the head of his company in the competition. (Although you can scratch what you've said about setup to kill each other if someone exists). <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, but I have not seen a movie about this subject. "T contain some of the fantasies of fantasy, but this is on par with The Firm for the ignorant. <br /> <br> /> I found it ironic that American Wood's morality morally ignores his character as a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's ethics and instead steers clear of any company using coke. /> <br /> I can go ahead, but I think I made my point. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, I can not imagine much, and I'm sure I I had spent the entire film breaking points, and more, I made the above and then guessed what was happening sooner than I did. "Believe me, I was well presented. <br /> <br /> I have a clear impression that this film It is unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows the scene, and I can not believe that the type Of females who are looking for emotional films that would give a curse about any of the characters given their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? The scenes of the fighting may be filmed and filmed well, but I was rarely impressed by the slow action, and certainly not when the battle is because the point is that the quarrel raises enough in any case. <br /> <br /> There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school raised a smile to me. But a few funny moments hardly compensate for watching two hours of complete fabrication. <br /> <br /> If you are a Briton avoid such a plague, if not just to develop misconceptions about the scene if you are not in the know. If you're an American, you can enjoy it because it's tailored to the market. But no one can deny that this plot is flimsy, predictable, and ultimately on top.
