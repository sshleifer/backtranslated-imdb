Literally, every aspect of this low science fiction budget falls within the categories that have been categorized for its predecessors, contemporaries and those who follow them. Bad special effects, a weak story, funny amounts of blood and heir, annoying and useless characters, all you can expect. "Attack of the Sabretooth" revolves around a new holiday resort, where owners are crafting Smilodon cats to attract their attention. The cats run away and start to kill people. The man running the show wants to save them and does not warn unsuspecting visitors. There are a group of visitors and some employees who rebel and intend to kill cats. <br /> Special effects, the film revolves around an average achievement given its budget. Sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI. Surprisingly, though, cats look more realistic in a close-up shot, rather than long long shots where CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are bloody and severe. Just as you expect, they attack and take off some arms and legs and leave behind very little. This is part of the reason why the film descends into a poor area. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are absolutely appalling. We have some college students who come to the island and plan to chase the garbage. And I take it very, very. Despite the infringement of private property, tampering with safety systems, theft. Why do they take a simple game seriously? am I missing something? Was there any money involved? Or were they sent to do this? I do not know, barely watching the film. But it seems to me like they were just doing it for fun to do it. However, they have gone far from normal. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Sabretooth" is a very bad film. Even for a low-budget scientific version, it is a bad and very cheap example. Most viewers will have to cry, be attractive to some, and make you laugh and laugh all the time. Keep in mind, this is not a comedy, it's a flick of horror, so it's not supposed to be a comedy.
