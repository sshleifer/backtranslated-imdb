This movie tries to be very smart, like Tarantino <br /> <br /> Before you try it, you need strong cinematic fundamentals. These include good sound, editing, group design etc ... <br /> <br /> Lets talk about the sound in this movie. Absolutely awful. I've never been busier with my audio, <br /> <br />, before we talk about a low budget, making a film in Chile, and so on. Let's keep in mind that the sound of desent these days is more attainable than ever it was. Anywhere. More information on technology is available beforehand <br /> <br /> The sound in this movie is very bad. Foley is particularly out of place and inappropriate throughout, Atmos is just as awful. I heard at least four high clicks during the movie, which is the result of poor audio editing. The sound inside the car is terrible, the sound of closing the car doors is awful. The voice of the lady singing wrong. Foley is either abroad, or simply there is not like a healthy person just bored and abandoned. The spaces are wrong. Everything about it is wrong <br /> <br /> However, creativity is not left in the way, at the same time the film boldly tries to be smart. For example the pelvic sound is used in the next street scene. We hear a voice when we do not assume. Audio adjustments precede visible cuts. Every trick is used in the book, however, the foundations do not exist only <br /> <br /> In terms of editing, we have scenes that use great jump cuts, we have tinkering with timelines, etc., yawning. All of these techniques are imitated to a surprisingly low level <br /> <br /> In general, mix nonsense, nonsense sound. Thus, the film crap. How can a movie be considered a lot of basic flaws of the awards and praise? Chile's new film wave? Best creative output by Chile? I do not hope so, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the most selective and best Chilean talent has avoided this film, like the plague, perhaps because of its emerging content. Equally, it is likely that the film received a lot of unwarranted cash praise from the "global cinema enthusiasts" for the same disturbing reasons. They are likely to enjoy the rubbish. Of course, film critics rarely notice technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This film is nonsense. Everything is mouth and not pants and is never worth rating 6.8. The film has all the production quality of cheap Tarantino, a new porn inspired wave!
