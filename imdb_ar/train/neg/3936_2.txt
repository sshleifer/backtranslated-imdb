Wonderful. I thought this might be poor but it was worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like watching a "car crash" well: very bad movies you can not look at away because you want to see how bad they can get it. That's the only reason why I leave the TV intrigued. It was not much acting, which was only modest or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and conspiracy that you should not have seen the light of day. The script, too, is a catalyst for harm. As for the cinema, did anyone else notice that they used the SIGO "curtain painting", as in an old TV show ... but without ridicule? At first I thought he should be kidding but the film takes itself so seriously that it does not use this tongue-in-cheek manner. Do not even ask me about the result ... The only point of interest is the final song, through Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people with something for $ 8 ... glad to see it on TV !!!!! Just silly! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had a hard time finding a lot of work lately? I think if you do not expect much, and want to watch a movie with care and indifference, it would be better than spending an evening cutting your toenails, which is why you deserve 2.
