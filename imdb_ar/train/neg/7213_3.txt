Although I certainly consider the Exorcist classy as a horror, I must admit that I do not appreciate it as much as many other horror lovers. As a result, I have not seen much of the extruder ripping for the Exorcist, and if Exorcismo is anything I should go to, I will say this is a good thing because this movie is boring as hell and definitely not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness with other exorcist incursions, this is often one of the worst, so maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It is not difficult to guess what this plot will be: it is basically the same as the Exorcist and sees that the girl possessed a satanic spirit (which turns into the spirit of her dead father). Then the village priest is called to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this star is performed by Paul Naschy, who is by far the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously managed the Spanish derivative Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two films: I think authenticity was not one of his strengths. There are not many good things that I can say about the film itself; it's mostly just plods along and the scene of exorcism is not worth the wait. Definitely not recommend it!
