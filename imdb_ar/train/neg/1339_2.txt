Sad, sad scene is really the revenge of Monster. (Fred Gunn received a big check to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this television-designed film about a pair of wax replicas of grandmother Grandma and Herman who are doing robots to "terrorize" the city in preparation for stealing a mummy hide in an exhibition. With the police in their wake, the old TV icons are trying to figure out who actually stands in the crimes to scan their names. (A minor minor point in the film), the grandfather turns into a racket with a wire connected several times (once to fly to Transylvania and Hermann somehow calls for the frequent flyer I think), a relative of the "phantom" who sings constantly and breaks the nausea Glass! The saddest thing to say is that it is hard to define: Does it seem that Gyon (in particular) and Lewis look at this point in every scene and are indifferent to the material. Are they hockey costumes for robots that have the values ​​of school production you are looking for. Maybe this is a funny scenario. Mr. Caesar crazy, mostly alien. Or perhaps you see something that made me feel happy and wonderful memories when I was a kid treated in the world of fashion K-Mart wonderful. In any case, the result is certainly disappointing and even ridiculous for Monster's standards. For the rest of the team, Yvonne de Carlo is sufficient in a more active role (although she is more likely to show up than a woman in her years and experience). K C. Martell makes Eddie Monster at all. Joe McDonnell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings like the above-mentioned phantom acts and behaves and speaks in the most ridiculous way. The film has a real cheap feeling about it even for a film dedicated to television.
