Simply put, this streamlined film is one dimensional. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this will not try to be something deep or do much with Hitler's character. Instead, since the first few minutes of the film where we see the child Hitler looking for evil with the evil music playing the background, we got a look at Hitler, who is showing his film as a super cartoon, apparently removed from a television program on Saturday morning. The film really wants to prove that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a film to convince him that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making it a monolithic personality is both tedious and confusing at the same time (one has to ask how an incompetent character in the cold film persuaded a nation by following him or naming the Time Man of the Year). This film has a great opportunity to capture a character who committed some of the most horrible acts of the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. Instead, she basically says only, "Hey! Hitler was evil! I think you might want to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film still has been attacked because it offered sympathy to the personal point of view. Give me a break.
