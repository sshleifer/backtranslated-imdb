Much of her "dead body" is so unfamiliar that I actually pressed my seat in an embarrassment for actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria has proved she can not carry a movie in this terrible romance. Comedy, moreover, they do not even have any comedy timing. She is annoying and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep the cake's psychic from dating her widowed fiance. The playwright Paul Rhod, a vulgar and charming actor, plays the psyche of Lake Lake Bell, where the film brings whatever energy anemia can. I felt very sorry for Bill, as she seemed to have some comic abilities and was working extra hours trying to make the material work. Unfortunately, they are against the insurmountable task of making any film showing Jason Biggs acceptable, and was dragged along with other actors such as Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. <br /> <br /> "More than her dead body" in fact ** extinguished me because of its laziness and lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can not get funded because large sums of money are being diverted to such nonsense. Seriously, do you think Hollywood movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really believe that the cinema audience will happen? <br /> <br /> Row: F
