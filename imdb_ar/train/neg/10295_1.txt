There are many false people who pretend that this has given him some kind of beautiful meaning, and that fools like me do not "get it". Obviously this means that we must stick to Hollywood Dirk. <br /> <br /> It contains all the technical cliches in the book - I think it's good that the director is one of the few selected. Almost parody submerged in their own excuses. <br /> <br /> The director of "Ratcatcher" (which is almost equally embarrassing) comes back with another piece of art that is hard to understand and seems to be a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is to keep viewers away from it.
