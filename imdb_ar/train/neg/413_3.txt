This is the kind of film that leaves you with one impression .. Story writing is the subject of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are amazing .. very good representation, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect .. except .. The story is so poor, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Picture this, if you have the ability to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our crazy world (played by Kevin Bacon) did not think of anything other than rape and rape. That's all he could think of his "genius" mind. Are you trying to get extra energy? No, he does not bother to look for a way to reappear. The man is basically obsessed with sexual madness. <br /> <br /> Add to that, Joe Lab, you have all these young people .. Throw around the jokes as if they were in a bar .. If it is not for all the coats and white equipment, you would think that this is a bad tradition for "acclaim". The shallow and very poor personalities are put a little interest in making you think that these people are only lambs to the Hulu Man wolf. <br /> <br /> Even when the film is exciting, the film is still short because "" scenes are very badly written and full of irrational behavior by actors who just shout "This is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the man "<br /> <br /> If you read the actual book, while the world pursues women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that suits his character. In the film "Cannes" is a patient person who goes to a crowded market to rub his body out of women. Just sad.
