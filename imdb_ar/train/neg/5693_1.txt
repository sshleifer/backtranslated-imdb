I can not believe the positive reviews of this film - I think it was one of the worst films and the most poorly executed and bad deeds I've seen. The plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). She begins to go out with him tied to the chair? PUH Leasing. The worst part is that it was not bad in a good and funny way. Just a terrible thing - I could not figure out why they annoyed them even to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was silly silly - incredibly incredible as a hit "eccentric" man. I wonder, I could continue - again, I was shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that made me see it was that it was fun to see how a mistake could be made in the film and what made it bad. The end did not disappoint! "I live by the sword, I die by the sword ..." Silly.
