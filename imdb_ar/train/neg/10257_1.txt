The film had great actors: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, McDonald Carey, Lou Ayers - all solid B movie actors. But the person who did not use any of these things for any advantage, with none of his characters on the screen (although Christopher Lee plays for himself in several scenes). <br /> <br /> Alien motives in this film seem to change when the hat is lowered. First, they just want to fix their ship and leave, then run the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after they have the crucial part they need. Then, from anywhere, this "peaceful" race decides that they have to destroy the planet because it causes a lot of "diseases" (although they give the main character and his wife a place in their community). <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spent watching a man or wife drive, walk, stand, sit or sit on desks doing nothing. I almost wish they had gone out with the rest of the planet in the end, just to take revenge from our boredom to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really love Chris Lee or the low-budget 70s science fiction, I'll give this one a miss. Located in this narrow range of lost celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
