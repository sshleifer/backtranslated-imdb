We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway play put on the film. The music is awful. There is not one memorable song in the movie - have you heard any reviews from this movie? It will not because there is no. Some musical numbers last a long time until I woke up to go to the bathroom and get some corn pop and it was still going on when I returned! If the songs were good well - but sucked. The pace is slow, personality development is terrible. The shot was praised for its singing but seemed to scream every song - it was impossible to stand up. This film contains no one but fanatical Broadway fans. This is without doubt the most valued film I've ever seen. Waist full of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this film except for Danny Glover - who was not on screen enough and his character was not sufficiently developed. I rented the video and agreed - this movie was expensive and unproductive.
