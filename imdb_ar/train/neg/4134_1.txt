I have to say frankly that I can not stop watching this movie since the second it started. Simply how bad it was !!! It's kind of like watching the paint dry just more confusing. I mean you're sitting there waiting for something to happen, anything in fact, preferably this whole movie makes sense! At the end of the film, I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that I had missed the first hour that made it all clear or whether I had inadvertently spent the movie and missed the parts that the plot had written (if there was actually one) together! The main thing that really intrigued me in this film, is that the main girl almost (in case there was a really big girl) was actually somewhat of an alternative, do I mean what the hell is going on at this stage ?! Suddenly I woke up and was in a mental institute, tied to the bed to a bed doped by doctors or anything, then faster than it would take me to the slit of my wrists, and turned back and was eaten by some random vampires had no sense of sodomy! I'm tempted to email manufacturers and claim my time, I mean I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage! I am somewhat interested in knowing if the filmmakers themselves really know what is going on around it! It seems that someone has edited all the bits that could have made it logical even though I think the movie had to be for 4 hours to achieve it! I was completely on the side of the other person who wrote the other review. I was deceived by this film in his title, and that alone. I'm so grateful that I did not really buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it at the local pound store. I thought this would give me the idea that the film had a whole pile of steaming garbage film but honestly I think Â£ 1 had a lot of money to spend on this movie! What a huge waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean I wish I were working, it is less painful than watching this movie !!
