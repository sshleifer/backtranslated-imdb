This film is advertised as a romantic romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic, and certainly not an effective comedy. The fortunes of a well-meaning character, Tom, oscillate from one very embarrassing disaster to another. The only graces that are provided is the outstanding performance by Toni Collete and the frequency with which Paltrow's face is generally nice, should be avoided!
