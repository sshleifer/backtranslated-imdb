I have a sharp problem with this offer, many of them actually. A simple list will be enough right now, I'll go deeper into later: superficial characters, a funny spirit, and a cheerful spirit. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to take a look at the rest of this review and read just so that you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I did not) for an angry teen from Canada I will summarize: suck friends , Not only because it is not weird but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new and good programs (Capture Development, Dexter and others). Friends are responsible for reality TV, "two and a half men" and "queens" just like television executives. Now then, with the review. <br /> <br /> These characters have no spirit, they are very similar in every way (outside sex and color of hair). They interact in the same way in boring situations and are completely safe in their bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor that comes with it? Why not break into Rachel Monica after Monica begins to hang out with Rachel's foe? Why does Joey not think of suicide because no one seems to take him seriously? Oh right, it caused one mute and he is so relieved. This is the curse of possessing ideal personalities: the perpetual and personal struggle (God forbid) becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The path of laughter is the only thing that should have faded as soon as he is born. Surely any display containing one is a funny reversal. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be "comedy" requires laughter from someone behind the audience, it means that the audience will not laugh without it. Laughter destroys humor by preventing a quick return. Humor becomes constructive rather than a free flowing entity (see Office, Development of Arrested Persons). <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: Humor is boring. There is no way to make an idealized personality more than just a funny soul (without seeming funny) just because everyday humor comes from realizing our flaws. So what if Monica dated 17 years? You immediately realize that what you are doing is not right and is separate from it. There must be a kind of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Perhaps her mother discovers or tries to get rid of one of her friends and ends up seducing him. That would be wonderful, it would be like a nursery battle! So far I have provided evidence of my position. Many of my friends love this show because they have not heard about curbing enthusiasm or arrest. Many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. <br /> <br /> I've seen very few "friends" in my life, but I've seen enough to discover the enormous flaws that make the presentation, in my opinion, impossible at all. If you have read this now, thank you, I hope you start at least watching some of the presentations I mentioned.
