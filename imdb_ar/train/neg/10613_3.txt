Maybe dancing was the only fun thing in this film - and even this was disappointing compared to some other movies. Judy! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of film - a movie assumes it is a work of art because it contains all forms of film art. Yes, they were beautifully filmed, but in the end they lack the depth and tension of the dance that the film is supposed to surround. Tango tease, it's hot, his drama, it's bold - specifically what this film is not.
