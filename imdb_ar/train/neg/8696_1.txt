I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my dad. First, I would like to say that the story behind this film and the establishment of the Amber Alert system is a good story. But the film itself was poor and the acting was terrible. The main problem I faced in the film was the second half with Nicole Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from mental disorders at the time and picked up Nicole without any intention of insulting her at all. She loved her as a daughter and was under the mental burden that he was saving her from the kind of harm or neglect that he thought was coming from her mother that she did not care much about over the three plus years that my father cared for and raised her briefly so her mother could be cheerful. The pictures of my father in a way would have hurt her somehow. The interesting thing is that Nicole spent several nights at a time in my father's place, while Sharon was doing or doing whatever she was doing. The reason my father originally believed that he was violent was because there were things imaginable as weapons on his truck. My father was a naturalist. The materials they considered weapons were gardening tools he kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, a good story based on real events, but the details of the film (at least the part of Nicole Timmons - Glen Park) are largely inaccurate and depict the director's failure to discover the truth in the narrative. The interesting thing is that if the director had interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would remember exactly what was published here.
