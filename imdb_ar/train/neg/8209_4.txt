The acting, despite other reviews, was well done. Brad Pitt takes on the role of an annoying and hateful Austrian climber. Other representation is fine. The story could have been successful, but somehow, it misses - one does not understand or care about the characters shown, so the story, which could have been very dramatic, fails to attract this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a truly dramatic story, important events that formed the world in which we live - but I could not, as I do, involve myself in this story. As one of the Brad Pitt fans who is not ashamed (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I was expecting to love this flick - and then, left me cool. <br /> <br /> It may be a failure in myself, but I tend to refer to the creative end of this film - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - one way or the other, I lost. It is shameful, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> A good, exciting and exciting story, beautifully photographed - it had to be wonderful. Not so. Maybe worth watching, just to think about it - but do not expect too much, and you probably will not be as disappointed as you. Mostly, I'm bored.
