I saw this movie at SXSW with the director in attendance. Quite a few people withdrew, and the crowd could hardly gather the polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> In 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes long. You can see failed and plotted personal attempts to communicate, in real time. The same cups, oral delivery movements, words and motor segments are repeated repeatedly - repeatedly - we get a point. <br /> <br /> In fact, one site compares this work to Mike Lee. What medications should you have to make this statement? Since Frownland is the song of Captain Beefheart, you should probably be able to enjoy the Mask of Replica with heavy rotation to appreciate this film. Incredibly, this won the Jury Prize at the festival. You can bet he has not won an audience prize.
