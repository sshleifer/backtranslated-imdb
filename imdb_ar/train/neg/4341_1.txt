This was so lame that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. The situation was very poor, and I could not even pay enough attention to tell you about my leadership. Although I really wanted to believe that the portrayal of young Carlito would be somewhat different, I could not afford to buy it. I do not blame the actors really, because I think it was text that might be flat. I found myself laughing several times, but I do not think those lines were meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> It's only the grace that is available is that I bought it in a DVD set and I would pay it for the price I did for the original alone. This is one of those situations that should let the classic stand alone.
