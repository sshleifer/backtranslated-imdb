Just plain stupid old good. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not good idiots like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood, and this is probably the most stupid film I have ever seen. To give this movie Turkey Golden is an insult to your turkey. To call this dumb movie is even offensive to the dumb people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, it is better for us to start World War 3 and 4 at the same time let the cockroaches run the show yet. <br /> <br /> Now I have to drink alcohol to wash this insult from one mindset ... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you are a suicide bomber.
