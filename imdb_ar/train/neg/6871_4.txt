A big concept went wrong. Weak representation, but the worst writing .... After watching the first and second episodes, I was wondering why they reached the second season. The characters are memorable, bad writing, and groups are OK. The special effects are simply sad - where the best was achieved in the same time frame - where do the funds go in this context? The first episode begins with an interesting and then quickly descends - the entire presentation principle is absurd. Now do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of science fiction and "geek" - but this offer simply does not interrupt. As I said at the beginning, I was really amazed by the arrival of the second season - it was canceled much better after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This offer was just bad.
