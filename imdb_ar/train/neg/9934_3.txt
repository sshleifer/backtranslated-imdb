As an informal listener for Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, because this film is "in his age" in the sixties. To me (a person born in the 1980s) this seems to me a sheer propaganda folly, but I'm sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during the 1960s. I was expecting an abundance of drugs with stones, I was disappointed, I actually showed a real life, hard work in the studio, and I felt very much as if I were working with them to reach the conclusion of this horrible film. I have not seen any of the other directors' films, but I suspect they follow a similar style in the output, a kind of "nonsense" that gave a feeling like the poorly directed Eurotrash television program, well crafted and lacking real entertainment. My only good opinion in this is that I did not waste money in it, it came with a Sunday paper.
