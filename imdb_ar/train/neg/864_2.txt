Although there is a collection of more than 180 films to choose from, the movie "Succubus" is often called the best film of Jess Franco. Heck, even the legendary director Fritz Lang considers "Sukobos" among his personal favorites. So, maybe that's me but I thought this film was very boring and very confusing. The opening is wonderful, however, and shows Janine Reynaud as an SM lead on stage. It's all a cliff here, unfortunately. The character of Raynode is a deception that ultimately kills her lovers in a kind of coma. Franco had a good budget to work with and spend well on beautiful sites, beautiful photography and wonderful musical score. This film may be his greatest film indeed, if it is not for the lame and uninteresting story. You are supposed to be a drug addict but I would say that Sumorik is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, you do not have a clue what exactly is happening or what is being said, so the short 80-minute run time seems to last. This is definitely not the best Franco film as I think. I would not recommend it to even those who crave cruel exploitation. If you're looking for the most famous Jess Franco movie, try getting Las Vampiras, Dr. Orloff, or Female Vampire.
