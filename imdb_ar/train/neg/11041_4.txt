The width is average. This does not make me particularly laugh. However, I think Courtney really brings it on. It does not look normal. She has these three ways to talk, all robotic. She speaks softly (without recitation), usually speaking (without reciting), or doing this thing where she starts talking naturally and begins to scream out gradually. However, her scream is like "Let's pretend I shout because I should not be too noisy in the group." <br /> <br /> She is always aware that she is a nice actress doing this funny thing. It's annoying. You can not really get her personality, because she does not really produce emotion, and stay tuned. She has this pair, who does all these stupid things, and there is no reaction from them. Very dry and behave plain.
