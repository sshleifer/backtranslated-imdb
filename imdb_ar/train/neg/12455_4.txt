I remember watching this at prime time when I was about 7 years old. I was a great reader of the comic book at that time, and everything about superheroes was highly anticipated. But the end result was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was familiar with Emma Bell's Diana Princess stories, which ended recently and Diana returned to her Amazon shape. However, there was little work so much that I felt bored throughout most of the film. The final outfit was an interesting idea, but it seemed like a more encouraging leader than a supernatural hero. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie again in the late teens. Not much improved. Cathy Lee Crosby was more knowledgeable, thanks to this incredible, but her behavior was not the best. The script had some good ideas, like the rogue Amazon, a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but he did not meet together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built a better back story, and built the show at a more epic height. It was very similar to a nice spy film, crossed with a supernatural story written by an unprecedented person from a comic book. Amazon elements were interesting, but they should be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film succeeded in forcing producers to return to the drawing board and come up with something more fulfilling, if the camp is too little and the budget is low. The budget was very low here too, and superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It will be good to have the movie available on DVD, just as a comparison document and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and has nothing on this film (except Chris Reeve and Jane Hackman). It is worth watching for curiosity and a bit of inspiration and caution for future releases.
