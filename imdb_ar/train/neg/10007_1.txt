This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her wicked behavior of "law and order" carries a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one who came out unharmed in this terrible comedy. The only positive thing that comes out of this chaos is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. Hopefully this effort produces better results.
