The film "To the Earth" revolves around Lance Barton, a black comedy colliding with a truck. Goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, the white man. So Lance does some things in Charles' body. The film contains a few laughs, but it is not something special. It's a good movie if you love Chris Rock. Madagascar, Animated Comedy 2005, Best. It's a good movie, but Chris Rock did better than this. It will make you laugh only 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really laughable loud. You will laugh at yourself and you may laugh, but you certainly will not roll on the ground.
