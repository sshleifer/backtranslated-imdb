I loved the first movie "Azumi". I have seen Mrs. Ueto in a variety of television appearances and watched my fair share of samurai and ninja jokes. I have to say that this film was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Because of the film's filming and setting it up in "Azumi", they should have been able to do much better with this film but instead, it was slow, piling up in pieces, and scattering with very bad, unconvincing acting , And Khashbi. <br /> <br /> When they bothered to mention the first movie, they did it in a very loose and weak way. In "Azumi", the title character is the best among a group of outstanding killers. In the film "Azumi 2" seems somewhat diminishing and less impressive. <br /> <br /> This does not mean it was a complete loss. There were a few decent fighting scenes and some of the most famous characters. Unfortunately, the film generally suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiyaki Kawagiri Lisa Ryuhi Kitamura and Isao Kiriama. The last two have had a sense of "manga" in their scenarios, while they have never "mastered" it.
