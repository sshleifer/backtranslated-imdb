The only wonderful thing about the film is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book through its cover, the title says nothing about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a fun film of popcorn, but instead, I got the terrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence" Yes, that's the bad way SOAP. The only thing that makes the best soap is its title. It is not even an apporiate title for the film, it was not even a glimpse of the "Snake" or "Plane" in 40 minutes of the movie! What a false declaration! If this was not his title, SOAP was just another memorable B class. R classification? Movie R must be the most needy of all time! The filmmakers add only a few words to make this level R, and all acts of violence are maintained at the PG-13 level. You know what R is really rating? R Rated Edge Star! See him at Summerslam instead of wasting your money on the snake!
