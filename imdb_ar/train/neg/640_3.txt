Cool, adapting to the adaptation of Rebecca West's book about the army commander returning from service in World War II with his weak memory (now there's an original idea!). It seems that he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to blow up some emotional sparks. This stunning blazing combines well with leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and starring actors Jackson, Christie, Anne Margret and Ian Holm, but all burners are low. There are a few good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but the speed of the bridges is uncomfortably slow and the color of the film is briskly refreshed. For a long time on the shelf, it is best to leave this soldier forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
