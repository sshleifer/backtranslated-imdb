If you really watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, be a boy. But be prepared to bring your horse with a radio. <br /> <br /> After watching a good movie like Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they have come back to in Indonesia. The only idea seems to be making money, but no one seems serious about working on Indonesia's image in the entertainment world. Does not seem to be a "global" world in the minds of those who make films in Indonesia. As the Indonesian public swallows whatever is presented to them as "made in Indonesia" with the West's flavor, they do not. <br /> <br /> Well, the story is beautiful. It could have evolved into a nice flick. But did not the director ever think about the fact that music needs first of all live music or at least a good run and a second good second dance? In this movie, playing SO BAD makes you want to cry directly into the cinema. Every word you hear is followed by the LATER seconds by the actor or who sings the playlist, which is very annoying while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The dances are designed as if they were going to produce a film about morning gymnastics, but in the end I thought it would be good to turn them into a musician ... They just forgot to change the choreography. They hardly dance, they jump here and there, throw their feet in the air, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there's a happy ending .... but if you can convince your girlfriend that candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do it!
