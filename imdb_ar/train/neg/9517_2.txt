Vincente Minelli films are usually worth your time; meet me at St. Louis, the bad and the nice. I have been waiting for this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running game is scene after scene to fight anywhere. Sinatra is a sad bag, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, pending disappointing camp, live in the disappointing excavations as Gal persuaded him to finish his writing disappointing project. The film features a dramatic dramatic ending in which the frustrated villain is disappointed with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The purpose of this sequence is to be full of tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; his attention is distracted by beautiful colors, and he does not notice that the scene is yellow cliches, the characters are very poorly turned and poorly developed and do not particularly care to take pictures. (Especially MacClane) but this is the only real film project. Otherwise, we look at the holding figures standing around bars and living rooms wrestling with each other for two hours. Hell is other people, it seems. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. The dilemma of returning soldiers to displacement and apathy after World War II is dealt with more skillfully in "the best years of our lives". Any of the Inge producers, Splendor in the Grass and Picnic, are desperate to get caught up in a clogged city.
