The 1960s was a time of change and awakening for most people. Social unrest and disorders were common when people spoke of their views. Ethnic tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual intercourse, and drug abuse were all part of daily fabric and daily news. This film tried to include these historical aspects in an entertaining film, and succeeded to a great extent. <br /> <br /> In this movie, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family equally through social and family conflicts. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. It is recognized that there are more personalities in this family, and the lines of the story overlap, but the racial aspects of this century are not given equal consideration. <br /> <br /> In general, the footage is well represented and historical. The footage is mixed with color and original black and white footage to document the film. The film is a fictional work, but clips from well known historical figures are used to set the time frame. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie but the positions were predictable and the script was one sided.
