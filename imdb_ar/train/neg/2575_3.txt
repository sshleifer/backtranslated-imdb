This really does not match the castle of Calistro. Lupine is not funny, foolish or overactive. The scenery and music are uninspiring and the plot is not just interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this is Nudity (only in the unpolished version) provided by Fujiko. This has helped to increase some boring scenes. CoC had a tremendous evil and prepared the film for some fictional pieces. Sites in TSoTG are not very lively or attractive. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon, and Jigen do not provide a good side-by-side rendering this time around. It seems as if they were merely filling a contractual obligation to appear. <br /> <br /> There is a DVD in a full frame with a Dolby Stereo sound. Contains an appropriate amount of additives, including a few trailers. But one strange thing. There is no choice of chapter on the disc or time code displayed to the player once it is inserted. Although you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote control.
