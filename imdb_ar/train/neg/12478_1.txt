I had to give this one because it's bad, but do not make it think I did not enjoy watching it, because I laughed and laughed, and I have some questions. So half the time I was laughing, half the time I was saying "What's going on in hell?" Or "Why does someone do this?" Etc. I often enjoyed the effects of the terrible fog, the bare scene / the scene / the dialogue / the nude in the 1980s, and the way the swords of the warrior flutter in the wind when they ride their horses. There are some crazy model effects (those are not supposed to be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand this guy who finds him in the cave, what's in hell? A friend told me about these films and I thought I would try them out. I liked the film mainly as people like Ed Wood. I do not have any real enjoyment of what the film was supposed to be. Look at it in my own way. So do not let this distract you if you really think it's an action movie, I liked it for other reasons. It is much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think as if you were wasting your life watching it (which comes to mind several times). I think the best thing for most people is to eat some drinks, get some friends, and laugh at this movie. This may be a bit harsh, but I do not think so, hired it and you'll see. U.
