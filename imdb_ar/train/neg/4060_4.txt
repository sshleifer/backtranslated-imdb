THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> < /> (35 mm and 70mm prints) <br /> <br /> A former blind journalist (Karl Malden) hears a blackmail conspiracy outside the Genetics Research Laboratory and later collaborates with fellow reporter James Franciscus to investigate a series of murders In the laboratory, unwittingly put their loved ones at the mercy of mentally ill murderer. <br /> <br /> After the unexpected global success for the first time in his debut direction with Feather Birds (1969), Dario conceived Argentineo The Cat Onelis Tails as a fictional film in much the same vein as its lead, Lagging behind the famous Hollywood actor Carl Malden - new from his appearance in Patton (1969) - and the rising star Franciscus (The Valley Guany). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which the ads claimed to be "nine times more suspicious" than "Bird" - is a disappointing follow-up, carefully filmed and executed with elegance, but it is rising dramatically and without public consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are clear in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Mientzer uses the broad chromosope framework to convey the high-tech world in which the mysterious Argentine scenario unfolds, but the sub-scenario involving Centurio Star Spa Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as a romantic service for Franciscus is nothing more than an unnecessary filling. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with a black glove killer in a crowded railway station (edited with a neat emphasis from Frank Starkwart Franco Frattelli), and a night ring in which Malden and Francis seek to get an important idea inside a molded tomb and fall prey to twisted crooked intrigues. But despite the flash of brilliance, the film runs aimlessly from one scene to another, and flows gently without reaching the boiling point. It is not surprising that "Cat" failed to simulate the wild success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
