This adaptively adapts classic butchers that is lovable for its accuracy. Timothy Dalton has no idea of ​​the nuances of Rochester. I felt that he had never read the book at all, until he was caught in a bunch of very narrow breeches and handed over a summary of characters that read "The Angry Last, the Incubator, the Mysterious Past." He plays the role of Rochester not as a personality or as a real person, but as a big part never smiles a smile until he is engaged at this point, turns into a miracle. There is no chemistry. The only feeling this adaptation aroused within me was the strangeness and empathy of Charlotte Bronte, who certainly turns into her grave. Go and book the book. Rochester has a personality. Incidentally: the scene of love "emotional" does not mean that you must eat her face.
