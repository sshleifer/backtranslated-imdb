The main aspect about superstar films in its later stages was the frequency, the gap between film and post. As a solid star of South Indian cinema, the reactions he received before Baba were remarkable. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he has been acting in Tamil has been a collective hero for 11 11 years at only one rate a year. All of these were a wonderful hit. He had a picture that could not be easily dropped. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he fell into a coma. His fans around the world, especially in South India were willing to watch a movie of any kind with their star at work. Therefore, the Tamil film industry decided to come up with the Baba. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers thought fans would take everything they put with Superstar. But this did not work well in this film. As usual, the hype of the media was expected of fans beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> Rajinikanth's image is completely corrupted. Fans went nuts. The movie set did not achieve the expected level. Great people's reputation went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was the songs of A.R.Rehman. Rahman is known to have composed good music for some of the worst films such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, and so on. Well, I never thought this movie would be in this league. <br /> <br /> You will feel very depressed, not because the film was bad, but because of the image of the falling star. It took five full years to fully recover it with two Chandramuki films and Seafage and give the fans what they are really looking for in a movie star.
