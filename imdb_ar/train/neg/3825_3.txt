I saw this film at the end of the week, and while I was always impressed by the beauty and film of the films produced by the church, I was disappointed that the film was too short, failing to inform the members and leaving the interrogators with many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> The film is 70 minutes from short essays from the life of Joseph Smith. It is not a true biography because there is no coherent real narrative. Most of the episodes are about Joseph doing his good work, playing baseball, racing and laughing with the children, often in the Slow movement. What a great person, just kind of guy who was Joseph, huh? Look at him there as he hits the carpet on his wife Emma. Well, Housbott carpets his 33 wives combined? He did not mention anything about polygamy. A blatant omission. <br /> <br /> In such omissions, the film falters. It provides very little information and leaves members of critical thinking wondering why Joseph gets feathers, why he is thrown in prison and why the mob wants to kill him? The climax of the film is of course the journey of Joseph and Herum to the prison of Carthage (riding behind the real United Nations faces from the entrances of Nauvo). But no reason has ever been mentioned. Nothing about Smith suppresses the newspaper Nauvoo Expositor and orders her newspaper to destroy it to reveal the teachings of covert polygamy. Leaves the public to wonder or assume that it is just an unfounded persecution of the Church. Joseph was not mentioned on charges of treason to declare martial law and call the Nauvo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly did not expect this film produced by the church to present the recent biography of Joseph Richard Bushman. Rowling, but I was surprised and surprised at how little material was made. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the material that was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped in my face. First, translate the Mormon book. The film, Joseph, immediately reads the gold plates in its two-ring binder, which was actually hidden from the site. Joseph is known to have translated it by burying his face in his hat, looking at the stone of the seer there. The second inaccuracy occurs in Carthage Prison, where mobs enter the cell. The history of the Church indicates that Joseph had six shots and fired a few rounds before jumping out of the window and giving a Masonic signal of tension (as reported in the Times and chapters). <br /> <br /> Maybe showing the truth of the gunfight would have destroyed the magical mood created by the filmmakers, but by deleting it, they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was: handy with a gun and capable of defending himself. In fact, the impression created by the film is that Joseph was a nice man, but it was also one of the pleasures that everyone hit, thrown in prison and killed in cold blood in the end. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man with many hardships and struggles to pay off what he believed in. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but learn that this is cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Smith's, Rough Stone Rolling biography <br /> <br /> Note: The films produced by the church have no balances, but the veteran eye can catch some familiar faces. Rick Messi is excellent like Joseph Smith, Father and Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in finding faith in Christ, and here plays the strange Methodist minister who failed to show Christian love to a young student after the fact.
