Slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three passionate words describe the movie book. This is definitely a case where the film has not been at the expense of the book. The best part of the film was an excellent scene. The worst part was the slow interactions of the actors, which were combined with endless insights. Editing is sudden and incomplete. Nevertheless, the actors have worked hard at least to try to be a little believer in a terrible text. It was amazing that despite his presence in Peru, there was hardly anyone out of Peru walking around in the group - even in the flashback scenes that depict Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
