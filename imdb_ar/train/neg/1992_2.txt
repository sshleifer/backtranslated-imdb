Do not let the name of this movie fool you, in fact Jake Speed, perhaps the characters are the heroes of motion movies known at all. When Jake Speed ​​does not save the maiden girls from the evil freaks, which he does not often do, he relaxes seriously. This may add to his charm, but in my opinion the hero of the movement is not supposed to be "chill out" whenever he gets the chance. Moreover, unlike other bold heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this guy does not have anything, unless of course you call sleeping talent. Anyway, this film is basically worthless, writing substandard, and the movement, when there is, is very lame. (The machine guns on the pocket were not bad, but that's all about it.) So, if you're in a mood to watch a film that is a cure for insomnia, this is perfect for you - a heroine who not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.
