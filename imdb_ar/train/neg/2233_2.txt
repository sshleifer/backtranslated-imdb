Worst film ever! I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this nonsense. The only reason not to turn it off is that I wanted to see the gangster on the cover and was not even talking about the wrong ads. The people who gave this movie to 10 people are either stupid or stupid or CAST members or CAST friends. <br /> <br /> I gave him a solid mark 2 because I did not have another one <br /> <br /> I have to write more and I do not want to. Wasting my time talking about this garbage. Please do not watch it and if you vote, this movie can move to its place. 100 movie down. I can not even tell you how bad it really is. Think of the worst film I saw at the time and ten years later. Absorb! If you think I feel bitterness, then I see it! This movie must be used to torture war criminals or Terriosts. If they saw this twice, they would pour the beans and beg for Mercy !!
