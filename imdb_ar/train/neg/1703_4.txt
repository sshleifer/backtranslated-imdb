A veterinarian in Vietnam decides to seize a town that is in a state of stagnation, and anyone who steps in his way (including women) is eliminated. Chris Christopherson, a drama starring "Christine," was released in theaters just before "Born Echoes", which turned his career away from ambition, without thought, and without enthusiasm. The results were filmed in Simi Valley, California, and the results were not really true, with the backward cliches and reckless violence making up most of the text by director George Armitage. Armitage collected his song in the seventies of the last century for his film, including Jean-Michael Vincent, Victoria Princible, Bernadette Peters, and Lonnie Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is Christoferson, who is rude and rude all over. It deserves the points where I suppose to be a totally unfavorable excitement, but the bad feelings (and the ridiculous climax) envelop the entire project like an ugly stain. * 1/2 of ****
