Honestly, this is easily the best 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. In part, because it takes itself seriously, instead of the usual light trash, these films want you to be emotionally involved, feel personalities, and be interested in the alleged plot. Nothing at all comes close to happening. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ******* <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) A plot that is not coherent and completely sensual. 2.) An annoying style similar to "MTV" video shooting. 3.) Original characters and holes plot. <br /> <br /> Give me the details. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when these films were produced, they could not determine whether a film would be produced about church intrigue, stigma, or possession. So guess what? They brought them together! The aetheist is obtained by a dead person, then makes it appear stigma and so to expose the church plot. How can the average person go beyond death and possess another person through his pool is never explained, not even talk about. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, gives it a stigma. why? Why not spit out? Instead, we treated scenes screaming things with harsh voices, engraving messages encrypted on cars, and writing graffiti. It is clear that this priest was also a violent man, because the young lady owned by her was also breathing on one of the characters, while she was talking in that harsh "harsh" smile that we all heard countless times. This also begins to link my second complaint, because when a young lady gets stigma, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating in the air, throwing everything and all around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why is this happening? Who do you know!?! I think the director thought he looked "fantastic". <br /> <br /> 2.) These films contain dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, birds emerge from nowhere and fly, the most annoying, of water dripping. Flat this woman dripping water down! continuously! Logically, the place probably collapses with these many holes. To summarize this complaint, in the end, and for no reason at all, the camera picks up shots of water falling, in slow motion, in the opposite direction !! why!?! I have no idea! It has nothing to do with it, and again, I bet on it because the director thought it looked "cool". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain it away. Holes in science. This makes no sense to me. I think going to church will be enough, but no, he must go through full capacity to become a priest. I just do not buy it. Second, there are a lot of holes in the plots, which I will explain below. For starters, when stigma gets first, the scene ends with unconsciousness and bleeding. After that, she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is in the end, when you speak the character of the "scientific priest" already mentioned about the soul possessed by the girl. He says, "Take me as a messenger!" Not a word for a quote word, but you get the idea. His reply? "You have no faith, only doubt!" So, for this reason, he has a scientist! There is no faith in the atheist, much less than any scientific priest! Then, there is the fact that the theme of this movie plot, this lost gospel (St. Thomas, I think) is available in local libraries. The characters are ready to kill to suppress this document, but you can walk to a bookstore and buy it. This is probably supposed to happen in an alternate history, where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us, or even hinting that this is an alternative event to uncover this document. In closing, this film is awesome to an amazing degree. It's the main aggressive, which I feel the need to insult every opportunity I get. I hate that. Final grade: F
