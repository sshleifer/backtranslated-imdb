Well, the story - a simple novel that enters the life of a little chick to death and her little brother and spoils life in her life - is an impressive story. Anyway, ideas are not something (everyone has some ...) - implementation is everything. <br /> <br /> This bothered me by clicking this. It bothered me a lot. The rhythm (output, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven, and the peak was expected. We've seen those horrible highways five, six, seven times - why? He viewed Norton's personal problems as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his / her problems / blah and his or her root. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a den? The references to the "taxi driver" were silly and unnecessary and were certainly not supportive of this click (or to E.N. in this regard). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, is executed in the end as a coward. Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Central America. This man should have killed the child, blamed the father, and caused real chaos. Or the child was supposed to have killed the father in the end etc., but no, we have reached the end of cheese where children miss the monotony, the father is confused by his own life and their relationship, the mud dies of course. The happy happy family remains unharmed, safe and bored again so that we can enjoy our isolated shells unhindered. <br /> <br /> In this scene where the vehicle enters the movie, my God, I had to think for a long time and it is hard to find something stupid from it! Do not shoot at such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. The creators of this film may have thought it was a good idea but it was more than disturbing. Again, if you are a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas anywhere or anywhere and you dream of having sex with a crazy man twice your age, well, you may enjoy this movie and his "message".
