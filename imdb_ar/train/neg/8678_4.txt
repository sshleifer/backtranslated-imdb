After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review of her. <br /> <br /> This could have been a very fit film if it had not been for the horrific camera action. It was far from annoying. All angles were wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fighting sequence. The closeup was more horrible. <br /> <br /> The story employs Sony Chiba as a personal bodyguard for anyone who wants to lead him to the top of a drug gang. He approached Judy Lee, who was not quite straight with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, because the mob and other gang of thugs are chasing her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, and despite the terrible dubbing, it was a good film. Given the best editing directions, I'm sure this will be a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it looks like another cheesy action movie 70. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence contains a familiar quote for "Pulp Fiction" fans, and then continues to go to the Karate School in Times Square. There is no other way around the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
