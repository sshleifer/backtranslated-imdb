Very funny to watch "Beretta Island" as a kind of natural trash. It's like responding to Jesse Franco's type of b-movie.Bodybuilders remakes (! Face to face!) For the two. Very stupid strike too! : Incredibly bad shooting scenes look better than manual fighting. Scenes are ridiculous. Save the incredibly stupid beauty scenes. The erotic scenes are very unrealistic. The main highlight of the film is the beautiful landscape and festival scenes. Do not miss: the joke of Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of the film and the list of relatives of Franco Colombo in the end. Special attraction: bare bosom. Forgotten Alamost - Franco can sing!
