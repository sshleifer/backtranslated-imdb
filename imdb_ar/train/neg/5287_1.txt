I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they already had a wonderful mini-series with Amanda Rot and Ciaran Hinds. Unfortunately, what ended up in the cutting room was all his intelligence and humor, leaving a film that was just melodrama rather than an armed display of English rural literature and morality. <br /> <br /> Also, the characters were shallow and uninterested. They had a poor time chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth became a very silly teenager. (And if you happen to be a silly modern teenager who reads this, let me tell you: running after saying like a female in the heat is not great). This is something that the pregnant woman of the Napoleonic era has not done, and certainly not this heroine of equal standard. <br /> <br /> Some said they found this ridiculous funny; my reaction was not laughter, but anger. The idea of ​​such corruption in Austin's work lies behind contempt. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible idea.
