What did producer / producer Stanley Kramer see in the novel by Adam Kennedy and Kennedy's very puzzling scenario? Were there a few intentionally targeted pieces? What about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Elie Walsh and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this confused story? <br /> <br /> And why was it that Candice Bergen, who performed a terrible performance, accepts such an unquestionable role? <br /> <br /> Domino wants to be on par with the Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark with a very wide margin. Big embezzlement by Stanley Kramer.
