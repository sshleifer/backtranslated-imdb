I sat in the theater bored as hell, I wanted to leave the film halfway. The Simple Plot 4 Samoan men destroy weddings. So they have to bring appointments for the wedding. Yawning. <br /> <br /> The thing that made me the most annoying was the rude jokes ... They were so crazy and cheered and thrown in your face to make you fit into the already bland film. The acting was below average and I felt that this film had just gone on and I had only a bunch of deceptive jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen in 2006, eccentric, misbehaving, ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God a friend shouted to me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
