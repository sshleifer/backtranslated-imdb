Here is one of these short educational films designed to teach anonymous people about the realities of life. This time the target audience is young girls, the fact of life is menstruation. It seems that this animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, with some sponsors of Kotex. <br /> <br /> He begins by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and irrigated show us how the body works, especially ovaries, uterus and vagina, and why all this leads to menstruation. It's almost amazing, to become a comic comment here, and how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned even though the word "furtilized" will pass once. I do not really know why I saw this, but since it's one of those rare short films that can give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to try it out.
