This movie was terrible. The plot ran out, the acting was bad, the editing was inefficient and this film makes me want to take my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie again. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes were very old, the sound was absorbed, I did not see the chemistry between the two lists, it was full of stereotypes, and the local "celebrity" veil. The worst thing is that these actors have had to play on the spiritual side and even they have screwed it up.This film helps create a long series of vague efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs in Hollywood. , Etc. I would give up watching this movie and instead ran straight to a brick wall .It would be more entertaining than watching this bad excuse to view.
