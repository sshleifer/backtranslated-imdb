The film was supposed to be the last Freddy (and it was for over 10 years) - I thought they were going to try to make a good movie. But they turned out to be giving us the worst of the series (that means a lot). The plot was useless (I can not remember it seriously). All the main characters were stupid (you really wanted them dead) and Freddy's shells were worse than usual. The only good thing remotely was a short (and funny) veil by Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" was his first film). <br /> <br /> As I originally saw it in one of the plays the last part (Freddy's Childhood Recalculation) was at 3 D. Well - the three-dimensional colors were poor colors and the image came in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had a backlash from my Republican. Everyone collapsed laughing. It looks worse on TV in 2-D. Useless and stupid - too boring too. Skip this and see Freddy vs. Jason again.
