After the mob boss Vic Moriti (the late Great Anthony Franciosa) killed his mistress, who betrayed him with Derek, the new veterinarian / Vietnam, and blamed the poor man, Derek finds himself in prison where he has to face the corrupt spoiler, , And yes, the illegal experiments carried out by a suspicious CIA agent (Big Basic Type and Senior Director John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into an invincible zombie. Of course things are out of control, and it is up to Derek, and the rest of the prisoners who have not changed, to save the next day after the prisoners spent prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a wonderful and talented actor as a Saxon director who is ... a talented great actor. To say that this film (John's only journey to history) lacks a certain visual taste that would be a bit of understatement. However, the film is not without merit. Dialogue, though stupid, is sometimes very bad. Unfortunately, this is not really enough for the film as such alone, and it takes forever until the film begins to appear on its own (which is somewhat delayed in the film). As such, the most I can recommend in this film is to say that if you are a Saxon fan (and I am already), they are worth watching one, and go with low expectations and you should be fine. Candy eye: Dana is not Mason and Tan McClure become naked. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D +
