I just watched this movie tonight, and I must say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but it ends up with more inconvenience to the funny here and the film is more than just a remake of the classic movie "Santa Claus" in the eighties but with the exit of the campfire or the bad song Sheena Easton in the end. Your story revolves around the black sheep mill in the family that is facing his family for holidays, but with the Arctic as its location. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family that returns home after a series of setbacks that included his girlfriend (Rachel Wise in the role of hijab) and he gets rid of him, so he returns home to face his parents and his most successful Santa brother follow Claus (Paul Giamatti) With little fraternal rivalry and a bit of anarchy that also threatens every Christmas. Now if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you will be right because it is predictable for the hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same beloved loser he always plays, but this time it ends up being more disturbing than what is popular. Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than one, while Elizabeth Banks plays the role of Santa's assistant. Many characters at all not the neurotic prank and poor Kevin Spacey end up basically playing the same person who plays in the film "Glengarry Glen Ross" but is more an anime. The only actors who came out of this movie with sound dignity are Paul Giamatti, who brings true and warm truth about his role as Santa Claus, but it seems rather embarrassing in the film and you can not blame him and Rachel Weisz, who can do much with a small role Very much more than most of the major actors with their role, and this is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserve much better than this script. <br /> <br /> To put them in short, a big disappointment.
