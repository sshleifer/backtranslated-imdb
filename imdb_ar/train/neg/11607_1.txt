I found Horrorvision almost inaccessible. While only 70 minutes I still find myself hitting the fast forward button repeatedly. I was acting from "If I scream and say *** k lot I intensive" school. The story was at best a scenario that has not yet been translated. <br /> <br /> While I never went to Full Moon to make a great movie, I never saw them produce such a bad piece.
