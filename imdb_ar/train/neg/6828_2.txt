In a film followed by a struggling actor, played by a militant actor, he clearly does not favor Chris Klein. He struggles to bring anything unforgettable to the role and the labyrinth through the shallow script being presented, which can only be described as a gentlemanly man. The story is there, but that's it, and fails to show any basic beginning, middle and end and the viewer is left to cheer his shoulders like nothing in the past hour and three quarters has already happened. <br /> <br /> One of the bright lights in the middle of this is Fred Dorset, who has managed to stand above his seemingly talented mid-level stars and do a semi-decent job of reviving the legacy of Legde. Whether you can re-create this when working with a high level of actors will stay but I will pay attention to it in the future.
