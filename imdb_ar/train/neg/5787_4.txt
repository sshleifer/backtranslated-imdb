As far as the movies go HEIST, this one is very weak. The continuity is very poor, there is not enough continuity of personality to really feel you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is wonderful and is one of the reasons worth watching. Falk has some great lines, such as "going back to the right or buying some sausages" or something like that ... There are some nice scenes, though they are entirely due to the actors' efforts. Direction, script and editing are very poor.
