Come on! Get more with Pakistan bashing players. Bollywood can not only produce great films, but can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of Bollywood, but anti-Pakistan films make me more inclined to enjoy a screenplay, a cinematography and a sequence movement - everything. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to see viewers on both sides of the border rejecting propaganda, and there are movies like Main Hoon Na that have been a great success not only because they deserve the quality of Bollywood Masala - but also because it tries to say: There is madness on both sides that do not represent the masses.
