If I checked IMDb before renting this DVD from Netflix, I would be back for a few hours of my life. I am frankly doubtful when I see that the film director also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same person "writer and director" - unfortunately, is an indicator of the overall quality of this production. There were a few interesting moments (for example, I mentioned Judy Tenota's first comedies that promote Judy-Im) that led me to evaluate these stars instead of one star. However, those moments were few and far between ... I could hardly see them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention his displeasure at violence. I admit I went back to watch this part again to see if I had missed something that would help me to know it once I see everything. No, although I realized at least who are the people who will later become important. The "rotary camera" technique was used excessively and meaninglessly. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" Or "For good, keep on working!" Not recommended.
