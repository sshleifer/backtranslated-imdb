I saw this film in its first show at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since American Beauty is the movie that has what it says, I had hopes in Towelhead. Unfortunately, they were disappointed. In fact, among the countless films I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only film for Sundance that I wanted to get out of early. <br /> <br /> The worst problem in Towelhead is that it is obviously a source of "provocative" concepts of cultural stereotypes, rather than organic human drama. The scenario is derived from a novel of the same name by Alicia Arian. Edith Wharton's famous saying comes to mind: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good even though it was adapted to the political views of the author. This remark is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are very old and simple. If there was a time when male bad guys in the White Towelhead, contrasting images of blacks, sarcastic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., new, it's been a long time. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please search for any of the many professional reviews available on the Internet. This film is roughly classified poorly and reveals the shallow texture and processor on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem to be more easy. When you read reviews on this site and similar sites, you will often encounter superior formulas: "amazing", "impressive", "deep", "appalling," ... it is embarrassing for me to read it, but it does not embarrass me. Surprised me. In fact, many people who seem to regard any book or film dealing with ethnic, cultural, gender or sexual issues as having been profound, thought-provoking, and full of insight have encountered. If you are such a person, all you have to do is hire and transfer Towelhead. On the other hand, if you set your criteria higher, you can move them safely.
