I found this on the shelf while sitting at home and bored. How can people give this 10? Not only is it supposed to be a good redemption film (I think), because it does not work at this level either. A weak conspiracy, a bad dialogue, a terrible representation; there is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to do with him, Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are terrible. The evolution of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and complete it, without actually writing the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but it will only take 90 minutes of your life.
