De Niro Scorsese's worst collaboration is in this long, painful, violent mess. Scorsese came out of his element in this film altogether, where the horror of a loud voice suddenly rang the phone and door games that seemed laughable and embarrassing coming from such a leading craftsman. The dice is completely lost here and the southern dialects are very troublesome and powerful. Nick Nolty plays the most wonderful lawyer in history who was thought to be able to defend anyone! The Psychic Bodine De Niro is no more than the Psychic Killer movie 90. The scene with De Niro and Luis Early is very embarrassing and continues its climax, and we should all be more tired than the psychic chaser who never dies. One of my most horrific experiences in the film. Renting the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
