This may be a strong candidate for The Worst Flick Ever. Perhaps without John Hurt, it can be tolerated as a small film. The tragedy of this whole endeavor, however, is that John Hurt, one of the greatest screen actors, is dwindling in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt showed ... I'm getting 8 points because he did not run away fast enough. As far as the cast remains, they are simply awful. Janine Turner, as far as she is beautiful, can not work to save her soul. The main actor is, for all intents and purposes, wonderful. If you can avoid this embarrassment, please do so. It's very bad, it almost hurts.
