This new version of the original 1962 film contains very good parts to praise it and some good performances by some good actors - yet Scorsese is finally picking to the most intriguing intrigues and Shakespeare's excessive demise in the embarrassment that I had to look at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a wonderful actor, dedicated to giving everything he has in the work he does, yet he needs guidance to focus his talent, which is largely lacking in the last five minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> Gregory Beck-Saleh's veil, but nothing more, while Robert Mishum is always happy to see it, even with a few lines. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolty becomes the best performer of Lorenzo oil but not the same as the "Herbs". Joe Don Becker has some fine lines while Juliette Lewis once again proves that talent sometimes transcends a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The beginning of credits (!), The first sight of Cody's back when diving in prison, the scene in which Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Cream Sam Bowden in total panic, and Cody's ostensibly quiet but unsettling destination. <br /> <br /> The worst? "Cleaning woman - but not really !!!" part. Stick to the shame on the underside of the car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no speed bumps in the US?) "He's dead - but not really !!!" PartS and end rowing mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I have seen the original again, but I have not yet been tempted to see the new version after four years of seeing it.
