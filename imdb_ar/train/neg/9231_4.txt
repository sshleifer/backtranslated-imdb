I went to this film thinking he would be the next book writer, but I left the feeling of frustration. The humor was weak and the characters fairly flat. That does not mean it was bad. The idea of ​​dating in the grocery store looks rather fertile, but the director focuses on his cliches: "Save Mom-and-Pop from Evil." I felt that if he were stuck in the dating service conspiracy, he would come out with an unforgettable film. Now, to accomplish the movie Justice, I'm from the Rochester area and I loved the way Webster portrayed it. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (of the scribes) here was offering props to his hometown. Webster, NY will review what Red Bank, NJ is for Clerks. The director wisely cast a history at Nick Tahoe. Trust me, as far as doing things in Rochester, there is a trash can at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this film in the Little Rochester, so everyone knew when the city icons appeared and appreciated.
