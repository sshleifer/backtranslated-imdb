It is a sad and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very calm and predictable and continues throughout the film. I kept waiting, but unfortunately it never happened. Representation is fair, but the text needs a lot of work. If you are looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these non-violent actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have not seen more than five gay movies, or have recently come to be gay, you might find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your low-budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I have ever seen.
