How many centuries will it go until the Japanese / Asian horror films give up the ghost story of a long-haired woman? Admittedly, they have managed to rip "Ringu" a million times, and this has often been good - indicating that originality is not much of a requirement in this kind of horror (or am I not too embarrassed and easy to satisfy?). However, this time I found myself a bit troubled, somewhat bored. It's not a bad film, but it's longer than half an hour at least, its ridiculous heroine 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror movies, the OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. In addition, the end is confusing: no sense at all. For the ring tone: Miike could have come more effectively than this little thing. Although it has been played dozens of times, I can not remember it - that was scary. Speaking of Miike, for him, this is something of a business, so if anyone who thinks he or she may get a Bijita Q or Audition, they are wasting their time.
