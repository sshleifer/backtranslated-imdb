My colleague rented this movie last night, so we saw it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive, because the entire film was filmed in this rich color and grainy texture. Quick sequences, cool angles and sweeping camera moves - at the moment you are about to see another "Snatch" at the moment .... <br /> <br /> When the plot actually begins to feel like an overdose of amphetamine. Things just do not make sense anymore. I hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving some scenes, but again, the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching it. <br /> <br /> First, you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. Error. This conversation does not offer any coherent narrative at all. On the contrary, Lesbian du Domino appears on the character of Lucy Liu during the second part of the film, which only arouses viewers' attention. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably a movie about a rich girl but a dysfunctional background that grew into a rewarding hunter. In any case, this is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But then the question of Domino's character is completely lost in the criminal conspiracy. In short, no, this is not a film about Domino. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably one robbery story. A beautiful bloody robbery. It has lost 10 million people, hunted hunters around suspected thieves, mafia children are being executed, and hands are being removed. Domino is trying to eliminate the reason why they did not receive reward certificates this time, etc. But this impression is quickly dissipated by another bend plot. <br /> <br /> This time, we face the sad story of an African woman who is obese, forging driving licenses in the local MVD and at the age of 28, she has become the youngest grandmother. Lateesha tries to show Jerry Springer the publication of some strange new racist theories, while struggling to find money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the master plan? URgh, well, no one knows. Otherwise, he had to explain to the public where the hunters would place bonuses of 300,000 collectors. <br /> <br /> Then at some point you begin to think: "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things." There's a reality television crew walking around with the hunters and doing some violent shots. A group of actors in Hollywood, who are constantly complaining about breaking their noses and wandering around a lot of crime scenes, but no, this is not a film about the media, it only appears intermittently throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to many Other sub-plots: the crazy Afghan man designed to liberate Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, an episode Mescaline, FBI surveillance ... <br /> <br /> Can all of the above things be assembled in a two-hour movie? Judge yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's real chaos!
