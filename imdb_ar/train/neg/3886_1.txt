Is this a stupid movie? Challenge !! I did not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Moments stupid? Abundance. Stupid characters? She defies. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, and this is not one. Well, people must start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson. He is the most unusual doctor I have ever seen. He got a melting man running in Ventura County somewhere, and he is not very happy that his wife is pregnant (maybe she was 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there is no place to crack the biscuits and he got the useless general on his block Who wants to find astronaut Steve. Sherif Mahli wants to know what is going on even though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters that have been thrown well and facing the solvent. In the end the film ends and the monster is brought to a trash can to become a fertilizer. In the end, this is just what you need for a great MST episode.
