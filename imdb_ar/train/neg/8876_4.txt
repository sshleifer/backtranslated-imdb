A kind of spoof for the family "An Officer And A Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (no doubt other films I can not remember now) are blended in a rather dull film with some bright spots. Gags always exist where you expect them, and Damon Lines and Wynns are predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie did not surprise you ...
