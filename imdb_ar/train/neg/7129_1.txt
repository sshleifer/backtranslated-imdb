This will be known as the Ferrari that crashed when Eddie Griffin was promoting. <br /> <br /> The story of the race and the bet is a bad result of the numbers that seem to have a way out of seeing the numbers. Pretty much point and shoot an affair with a group of actors in it for a salary. This is not a good film, but it is not bad enough to be a spectacle and ends up as a sponsor that does not deserve anything to bother no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Hatred of women, despite the fact that one of the horses is a woman, this film is clearly created only to get the producer and director near the beautiful girls. Want a guide? There are long shots of women next to anything that serves no purpose but perhaps get an uprising from people who are afraid of renting a porn video or a DVD Sports swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
