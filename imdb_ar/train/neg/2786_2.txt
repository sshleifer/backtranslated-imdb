Well, I will not criticize this film in depth. I have noticed many of the eloquent reviews that preceded me and, as I generally liked Maria de Medeiros, I have long hesitated to make an insulting comment - and in this way, almost a year has passed. But every time I see a DVD on the shelf, I feel internal pain. Anyway, let the hateful voices go beyond me! But for other cinemas like me - watch out. <br /> <br /> The political unrest and its overthrow as a backdrop to this film was a background for a certain period of my life - through newspapers I read daily in a bar Local Central European. At that time, I followed the news reports, but I never quite realized what was happening. Journalists tend to report in a nonpartisan manner, or with conservatives who disdain any groups that are destabilizing peace or provoking rebellion against the institution. In those times, the winds of other unrest were spreading in Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States, all of which I understood clearly at the time - but the dictatorship or not, my papers tended to treat the Portuguese government simply as establishment - not as a "wicked empire" Use, to use the terms of the Star Wars burning. <br /> <br /> So, after a week or so, I read the unrest, but I did not find a clever editorial that might provide the history behind it, evaluate the practices and socio-economic effects of dictatorship, and so on. <br /> <br /> So, when buying this movie, I had at least two hopes: to understand the details that led to social unrest, and enjoy a good design. This movie did not give me. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have a thorough knowledge and deep feelings about historical facts. And drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - they were vulgar and shallow. <br /> <br /> I got a copy of the DVD from France - "The Official Choice 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box shows clean smiling actors, and it gives a victory sign in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy Rabbit. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could have thought about - although it is a shallow piece of "cinema reality" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural tendency to praise it for its "sincerity" but ... <br /> <br> /> Look at the back of the box: "Un respect chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm appreciation? Try to describe the overthrow of Lindy and murder with "warm respect"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole set of coups, civil rebellions! <br /> <br /> There is another review: Maria de Meadows son of Reno who pays for it, and his son enfance et son histoire. "Garbage, trash, garbage! At least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal, in all of Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and country does not come out empty. In Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa. At the same time, I am stuck in Area 2 of the above address which may also go to the trash.
