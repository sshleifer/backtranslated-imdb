Yes, I know that this film is a great example of how to combine a combination of "depth" factors (political unrest, love / lust) and random to great cash praise (see also "American Beauty"). Kaufman's films accumulate alongside unspeakable sexual scenes interspersed with painful sequences often (in one scene I have counted three different "general European" dialects influenced by actors). The performances of the situation may appear chaotic, yet they fail to connect them together In the coherent meditation offered Condera. Within three long hours, the group was able to shine on Franz, the missing fourth piece in the love triangle at the heart of the plot, thereby sacrificing the central mechanism of the novel, which is to display the spectrum of emotions and power relations it obtains in the affairs of love. He also failed to include in the time of the presentation of the symbol of Ibn Thomas, which was used in the novel to illustrate some of the political points made by Kondera in the novel. Along with the extended soundtrack, these flaws make three hours of this film unbearably heavy in a light tone of content.
