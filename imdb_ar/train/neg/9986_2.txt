The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression" the will of the author. "Does anyone know what that means?" Ask them to sit across the "head over the water". The only way that Diaz could escape from this film was through this literary apparatus, which is commonly used for bad writers. There are some scenes and you will get some laughter. However, the film does not withstand the most accurate analysis. Why does Killett tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so you can do a chainsaw gap of course. For me the best part of this film is that I watched it on cable channel instead of spending four dollars in the video store.
