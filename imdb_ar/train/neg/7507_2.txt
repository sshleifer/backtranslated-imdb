This movie is bad news and I am really amazed by the level of great name talent who have agreed to appear in this kind of spam. I imagine that there were a few clowning agents in the Hollywood Boulevard. As a result of this failure. What really gets you is that it could have been good. The director's call was a star and a subject enough to raise interest in ticket and ticket sales, but that flipping. The story lines go from bad to ridiculous at the end of the pictures, and you end up like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns into rot. What Spike can do is take revenge on any Italians who may have beaten him when he was a child or insulted him, as the film does a good job of perpetuating outdated and possibly offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some exciting and fascinating picture films. He has the talent to capture your psychology and take you to see him, even for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... Can you afford two more hours of scratching and watch the clock as you wonder and wait for the end that should be there somewhere.
