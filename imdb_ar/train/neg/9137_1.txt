What can I say, this is a wonderful piece of film that should have won the Academy Award. A secure copy must be kept in a safe vault for future generations. Viewing must be required for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most author / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart more than a genius to honor the world of cinema through his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start this? Every hundred seconds of Ben and Arthur were so wonderful! And Marovic in the role of Arthur, F., it is very attractive, I am surprised that he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during the naked scene. I lent this film to my brother and called me on the phone, saying how Arthur's nude scene turned him into a homosexual. Of course I fully support this film, which is beautifully designed in tolerance. Why yesterday burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in its burning ash. <br /> <br /> Cinema was the best thing in this film. When the former federal plane set off into the sky amid palm trees in Vermont, I cried! Why, I did not even know that they have palm trees in Vermont or that people can travel on former Fed planes before this film. I opened my eyes to a new world of possibilities. This film inspired me to join Sam Merovic School for screenwriting, acting, directing, writing, casting, production, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Marovic, thank you for bringing this creativity to the world ... We can never pay you enough."
