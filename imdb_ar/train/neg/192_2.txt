The only good part of this film is the beautiful scenery. This film was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the podium at a time when his son Paul had moved away from the teachings he had announced. How many times can his children take the name of the Lord in vain in this film from the Presbyterian background? Does not fit. I wished that Paul had invaded the river without a boat at first to provide us with the absurd and ridiculous absurdity of Paul's story. So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive teacher Norm wants to save but does not. It's not very interesting. We see white eggs standing in front of Paul because of his native American daughter. This was the only part that had some interest and perhaps could have been developed into a real "Western West." What we see only is a sleepy town where the minister's son has nothing else. Of pigs and tie a lot of flies. The best viewing view about fishing in this film again - which will never happen.
