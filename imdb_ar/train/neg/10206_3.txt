From the director of Reversal of Fortune, I think I saw a little of this in my media studies class, and I met the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the classification of the critics. Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling of the Half Nelson team) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt) in the Paul team were charged with murdering a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they could escape without the police finding them. The investigation into the murder is the homicide investigator Casey "hyena" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with the new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is puzzled by the evidence on the site, for example non-related hair. The plan does not seem to be going well because Cassie and Sam are quickly working on Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a question of whether they can influence them. He also starred Agnes Brockner as Lisa Mills, Chris Benn as Ray Vethers and RD. Call in the role of Captain Rod Cody and Tom Firika as Assistant. D.A. Swanson. I can now see the same concept of Sir Alfred Hitchcock in the killer rope for something difficult, but this film does so in a very silly way, and not even a good Bulok can save him from being boring and predictable. Adequate!
