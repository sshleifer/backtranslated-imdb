If the budget of this film is $ 20 million, I would like to know where the money went. Monkeys can achieve better CGI effects, then what has been wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful garbage, although I have to admit the machines and the Marsians would look really wonderful in the original playstation 1 game and early computer games. From the mid 90s if a game was made. What amazes me is where the money went? Pintrone movies could have made a great film with good old models and computer-controlled cameras, George Lucas circa 1975-1983, actors who seem to care about what they do (or destroy) For the same 20 million. Maybe this is the worst movie ever! Best to sit during the Ishtar show 24 hours instead of watching this movie again. I totally hated him! I retreat. I say this is the worst film ever made, because unlike other bad films like Plan 9, Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are very bad films and you have a special place in your heart, you love them. There is no love for this movie and there is no place in my DVD library. I sold it to a man for a dollar. I bet that the movie money was spent on wine and other vices for actors and crew. Shame on you Pintrone movies! I want to recover my money!
