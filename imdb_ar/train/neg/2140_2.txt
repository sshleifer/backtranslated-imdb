The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is the strike of an oil minister in the Middle East, called Omar Neikov, in the country of Turkestan, which is run by US interests. Hauser is a trade fair producer to allow him access to life. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the spelling can be so exaggerated that it becomes more disturbing. Here he does a lot: government, politics, music, war, people who are not accepted by society in general, and have you mentioned "war". This is what we have here - a very annoying film that limits the very bad nightmare brought to life. I still ask myself why I followed a DVD. Also, there are many members of the Cusak family in this matter, where John Cusak seems embarrassed by the presence of the family there only, or is this just me? <br /> <br /> John Cusak's film, while a bit odd, was, in the end, fairly good. not here. We believe that John Kusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Make this what you want. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of events happening in the film accompanied by constant shooting, explosions and screams you can not really focus on or was this the point? Likely. The setting of the strike takes a very long time, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. Meanwhile we have a meaningless joking among all the cast. The chemistry between John Cusack and Marisa Turmi? I do not think so, but you know: boy? Girl something ??? And they need something that takes longer. <br /> <br /> Yes, what they were supposed to be (abnormal and annoying), Duff and Kingsley were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Eckroyd, at the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet that took a garbage dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing praise for this effort, but if the rose is still a rose by any other name, is it also a mess ??????????? <br /> <br /> I now remember why I continued with DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow stabilize and save itself. you did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: Nudity Number: Language: Yes.
