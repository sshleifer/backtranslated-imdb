Like most people love the "Christmas Story". I have never heard of this film and probably for good reason - it's horrible. The same language, the same narrator, the same director but the warm ambiguity of the original was lacking. Charles Grodene was a bad choice to replace Darren McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Interacting with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In the "Christmas Story" Ralph Mania appears with a nice BB gun but his obsession in this film is dull. The Varkos Scud, an original bullying in the neighborhood, has been replaced in this film with another child with clasps and an exotic hat but with a little fascination of scud freakos. It would be very difficult to equate the origin, even if this film had been made with the original crew.
