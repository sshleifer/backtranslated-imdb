Although there are some exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN never starts. There are boats exploding, hat murders, mass suicide, pathologists with body parts and all kinds of classic horror / horror scenes, but they are interspersed with extended periods of pure presentation. Everyone in the movie seems bored. This is a shame because many sequences will be considered bold at the time it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to that the Brit characters are "very appropriate" and you feel like you are drifting to the Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film industry is very ordinary. There are plenty of opportunities to take beautiful pictures of the countryside, or complicated shots of someone being dragged into a huge fire, but the whole thing is unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Certainly only for Lee and Cushing fans.
