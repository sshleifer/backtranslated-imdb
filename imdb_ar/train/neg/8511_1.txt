I could not, throughout my life, follow, understand or understand the story. As the plot progresses, it also remains incomprehensible. I will guess and say that there was a problem in the pre-production / problem story and never resolved. Producers can never dismiss many of the details of the novel, or any novel, about the time and space they can create from the other idea: a film about a serial killer and the hunt for the killer by the police. We've ended up with a lot of things happening at the prohibited time limit for a feature film. Very bad indeed because of their strong actors, a director who knows how to move objects and excellent cinematography. In fact, a good movie one can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
