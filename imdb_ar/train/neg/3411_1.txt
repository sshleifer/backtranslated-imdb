A mix of exotic exotic sites, kids in tights, bangs, and the clone of the beautiful-looking Dudley du Wright, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Shin), a small martial arts and a sexy villain (Tracy Lor ....er, sorry .. Tracy Elizabeth Lords) believes you will be in some fugitive fun. not like that! It's a gloomy film, and although he likes to promote himself in a Charlie's Angels deal, he's not anywhere near the original series or even the Godwood, irrefutable stupidity, and talk about C.A. Movies. This abomination is best described as a third film about Andy Cedaris. There is no place near the fun like "Hard Ticket to Hawaii" from Andy, although some fighting scenes are adequate enough. Girls spend a lot of time appearing and trying to look very angry and it gets worse after a while. There are better things to type that out there. Oh yeah, the "babe" is not as hot as they think of them. Horrible soundtrack ... when there is.
