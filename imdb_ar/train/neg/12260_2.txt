Sometimes I relax and think about the reasons why films about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made these days. They have been making these lame "jaws" since the 1970s, it is not as if they are loved. The idea is still exactly the same. So our animal starts to kill people. First, some secondary characters are dropped off, then begins to attack the main characters, which are usually played by two people. No one except a person used to being a little more famous, usually plays a specialized role. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill the animal one way or another, usually as a result of an explosion. After that, we usually get the last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or laying white, etc. etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does nothing at all to create a little difference. Unless you calculate the fact that the "specialist" is a leader in this difference, in this case your criteria are very low. It's funny to be played by Duncan Reger though he was quite used to being Zoro. I'll give him a reward point for that.
