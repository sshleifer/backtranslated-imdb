This film has been produced for Danny's fans (The Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think it's just an imitator riding a black metal cart (however, I'm generally not a black metal lover). But while I was carrying this DVD box to pay for it, I convinced myself that the least original thing was that it was more convincing. So I assumed I was on a roller coaster ride from the rubber bull and ran yourself with a sinister background. Now, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I arrived at the house and spread out. My patience lasted for 15 minutes. The camera work is awesome and the quality is disgusting. It was then (2002), as if it were filmed using a Hi8 camera. I left her on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies will create a beautiful environment for this picture .... <br /> <br /> After a few months, I went back to it (in the mentioned areas) and saw half of it. Then not only the mentioned aspects bothered me. My hatred has evolved. I noticed how funny Danny (a height of 1.65 m; height 5'5 ") appeared in his shoe platform and he tore the head off one of the culprits (yeah, tearing it seems his head did not have a skull.) I also found that this movie might be It did not make sense, however, I did not finish yet, so I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After a few last attempts I finally finished this click - a few months ago ... (Yes, it took me 5.5-year-old.) So - Danny was really funny like the devil's assistant / Manson / the evil supernatural man, and the DID movie is not logical. We both have two short stories connected to Danny's character: he was about a person who was stealing the Legone SONEONE leg because he wanted to use it himself ... Yes, exactly. <br /> < The actor CGI is the worst and the boy is CGI baaaaad Stinger The story does not make sense ... The quality is ... Let's just say it is not satisfactory The only thing that might make you see is the non-motivated violence And Jour. Blood and courage are well made. Why, you can actually see that the film grew up there and then go. (For example - Danny "The Man" takes a stuffed cat filth - it can be fake - and takes it ... then eats what happened ... Why? We never know ... but we know that this cat must be in relation to illegal substances, where That his heart is almost half his size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment that this movie is very bad, but good. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. Add one for humor.
