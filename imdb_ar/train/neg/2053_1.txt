Why do they insist on reproducing great films such as "High Noon" and "From Here to Eternity" and this film? <br /> <br /> Why do they think the color is more attractive to the viewer than the blatant black and white? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on wearing a broad-banded baseball cap ... made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone spend four hours experiencing this? <br /> <br /> See the original. Then you will not have to ask yourself why.
