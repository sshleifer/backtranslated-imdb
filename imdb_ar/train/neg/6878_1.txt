I am Puerto Rico and this is one of the worst documentary films I have ever seen. You can see that people are so ignorant. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Ricans because they are descendants of Puerto Rico, but they probably know less than others there. You can see while they talk that they are contradicting themselves. If you want to see a real and real documentary from Puerto Rico, you should see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a real and serious documentary. Not such a piece of garbage. Rosie Perez adopted this documentary on herself. I think it was supposed to be around the Puerto Ricans. They continued to repeat and I did not know. Well, that's about the only thing they got about this documentary. I hate to see a piece of garbage being done using the name of the island. He descends standards.
