With no affinity for any kind of filmmaking, and the health rating of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself because I was annoyed to sit for a 20-day period. I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. I will say although the loose Berkovich novel designed by Woody Allen was very disturbing. You either want to dispense with coffee or take some sedatives. Berkowitz himself is likely to be clear that the film was a bad idea, with parts of him detailing his experiences to fund the documentary. Let me hide the insults as compliments, but I will give Berkovic credit for having the skills to convince some idiots to finance this terrible piece of ****. I appreciate the limits and intentions of the film here, but even when it comes to Berkovic's criteria for himself, he starts off and makes mistakes at all levels. In conclusion, I'm sure that many of these companions have never been so easy with an appointment with the director that wants to be, and so I'm wondering about the film's sense of originality. Miles, I loved your movie for the first time I saw it ... when it appeared like a ring from Seinfeld or was directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
