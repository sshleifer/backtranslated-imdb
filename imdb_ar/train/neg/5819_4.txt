This is the story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. The parents divorced and my mother stayed in the east at home. Father Murray Abramovich moves with his children to California and travels around Beverly Hills so his children can get the best possible education. <br /> <br /> Things are really funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's daughter, comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the various family adventures that the drug scene has in the rich neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Costa Rica Jessica Walter as a woman wants Murray to move around with her because she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Karl Rainer and Rita Moreno finally arrive. They play Murray's brother and his wife's sister respectively; they're also Tommy's parents. In front of the children, Rainer allows to remind Murray that he was paying them all the time. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a trivial observation as the awkward family moves from its massive excavations and takes a ride around Beverly Hills in their car. I think the film promotes independence and some good old self-esteem.
