This is a German film from 1974 about some women who arrive at a castle and beyond. I can not really tell you the purpose or even the purpose of the film. I can tell you that there are many women who work in the moonlight as maids in this very castle who burrow, paint the body and turn on the bongo as if they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, and it seems to be a good part of the run time for this film. Yes, there seems to be something characterized by the worship of demons and vampires, there are some girls who wear girls' clothes, etc., but the main focus seems to be that colored children dance in the basement. I liked the rolling of the eye of one of the most important housekeepers / maids of Satan, who gave originality to the procedures and made it more a bad appearance. Was this Wanda evil lesbian (as described in credits)? Did not matter. If you are not picky about your homosexuality films, you might want to, otherwise you'll be too boring and I can not even finish them, I'm bored. 3 of 10.
