I saw Crispin Glover "What's this?" At the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Admittedly, the film was named at least appropriately, because I got a clear sense that even the writer / director could not provide an answer. In the question-and-answer session after the presentation, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally intended to be a short film to demonstrate the virtue of using actors with Down Syndrome. However, this in itself is not enough for a reason to create a movie. In my opinion, actors are the building blocks of a larger vision - a larger vision that seems at best confused and at worst absent. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to address the taboos. Well, he does. but why? The film seems to have no position, and there is no reason to handle anything. Do you feel that these things should not be taboo? The film does not give me even an indication of it. Forbidden taboos are not interesting. It can not even make taboos annoying or provocative at any level because it does not care about the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the concept problems for a moment, the thing that shocked me so much was how poorly the film was assembled. Editorial, cinematography, and other technical aspects often looked to the very amateur. Glover said that between $ 125 and $ 150,000 went to the film, and I felt that the money should have been spent on different designers (Glover had already done some of the designs himself - I know I saw at least a sound design in the credits). The painted groups are fine (not great), but poorly used. The parts look like a play that was filmed - and it would be good if that went to any kind of purpose, but in the hands of Glover it felt dirty. Other parts, such as a kind of home-made film of poor quality, are filmed for many of the things that filmmakers see for the first time on my music. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is "What's this?" Can not even understand how serious the film is. There are some parts that feel that Glover screams at you to think seriously. At other points, it seems to be in its small swing. It may have meant to be ridiculous, or somehow meaningful, but I just felt that Glover could not even make himself give his film any kind of serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted to be a short film. If only. In seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of images and ideas in the early twenties, and it can be said that the ideas were drafted enough to claim that they existed until that time period.
