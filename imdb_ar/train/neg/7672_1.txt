It is clear that many talented behind-the-scenes crew members work in this film, so do not even look at credits in the end, but will only carry them against them. No one was interested in watching this film, only 3 of them were in the theater; two died after 10 minutes and were lucky. The "Monsters" were the idle worm of Star Trek 2, Khan's fury, and rejected the designs for aliens in space. It is clear that the creators of the film did not want the tyranny of the third-rate film monsters, so they hired actors from the category who did not seem to be able to memorize their lines, or in some cases learned to pronounce the words before they started filming. Some scenes are incredibly inefficient in conveying what is supposed to happen, if anything happens. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is screened, and did not miss, you will laugh at what are supposed to be scary or dubious moments of the movie. The credibility of many scenes will only astonish you, and Stephen Dorf's regular cast of "Queen Mary's Curse Words" conveys the feeling of anyone paying for it. If you should see this movie, do your own interest and wait until it's in the bargain box at the video store. If there is any justice in filmmaking, there will be a key player to hire you.
