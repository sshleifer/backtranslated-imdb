The man plays a stunning meltdown like an extended episode of a six million dollar man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a little bit overbearing but I found it impossible to dislike it. <br /> <br /> Acting and text is not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year-old film with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a long time to melt, but when it does it is reasonably impressive; we also have an innovative death scene involving electrocution. It's also worth noting that it's music, it's crazy - a mix of cheese and nonsense. <br /> <br /> Highlights: <br /> <br /> * Excuse the slow moving nurse jumping through a piece of glass for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> * I was amazed at the days of a broken head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the melting of cannibalism that dissolves in humans. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break from chasing the melted freaks to get a bowl of soup and complaining that there are not enough crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is too 70 for me to hate it. It is tacky and cruel but I thought it was very fun. You can do much worse.
