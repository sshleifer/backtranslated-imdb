I was looking at the list of Richard Burton movies when I came to this address that I remember vividly when I first saw it on the cable in 1982. I remember the conversation that Tatum O'Neill did, which was so bad. I remember that the figure of Richard Burton seems hopelessly lost, and then I remember how his motives did not translate into me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared at a time when America was going through a very worrying period of dazzling angles at unhealthy or perverted teen sexual activity. Remember Blue Lake (and other Brooke Shields harassments), Lipstick, Darlings Little, Bio-Bear and other films that seem to talk about teenagers who have sex, especially with adults. When I was a teenager during this time, I found that mania, in addition to sexual excesses in the 1970s and 1980s, was made for a disturbing, unconscious environment in which to discover everything, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "The second circle is not dealt with in a difficult or unwarranted way, like Blue Lagoon." In fact, it deals with love between young and old in a courageous way, if it fails completely. Those movies you will never see * If you do not see it in its first run because it was so bad ... no one wants to have this surface litter ever to be distributed to the public again.
