CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is clear that the series has reached its natural end with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from mid to late sixties <br /> MATRON is not bad on itself Absolutely, we've seen all this before by a thin plot (a group of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a set of pills they plan to sell to Third World countries) surrounded by puddles of a bit amusing despite the unspoiled nature. I think this is where the problem lies - not all the gags are amusing with the uncomplicated nature that has begun to show its age. Did we need another film that uses a man dressed as a woman to lead the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw Carey on Matron this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for comedy
