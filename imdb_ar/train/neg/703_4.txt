College students, who remove a convicted dormitory, are being chased by an elusive assassin. <br /> <br /> Dorm That Dripped Blood (also known as Pranks) is a mixed bag for slow lovers. The production values ​​of films are largely low, and the story is mostly fairly routine; there is even a creepy bum hanging around in a red hanger. In fact, much of the story's accumulation can be forgotten, except for a brutal murder. But the film has become really better through its surprisingly intense peak (in an atmospheric setting) and a bold and somewhat unconventional ending. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly weak. Steven Sachs is the best of his kind because he plays a beautiful role in character. Also look for young Daphne Zuniga as an ominous student. <br /> <br /> On all of this, this effort is a record effort, but the end is worth a lot of taste, and this scene saved the film from being the most complete hum-hum. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
