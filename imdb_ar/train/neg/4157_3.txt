This seemed a more appropriate title when suicide bombers and I decided to watch this fragile modern masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The sensational, scary, suspicious, well thought out are all the things that this film failed to be. <br /> <br /> However, it is very funny that slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to that to make one of the greatest comics I've seen in recent years. However, this film does not even try to be funny, and this is one of the great achievements of movies, it becomes a comedy without even trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an amazingly old man Santa Claus is about plowing over the zombies and smashing vampires in the ground. This made me fail to believe the title of the movies, if it was vampires versus zombies why were not the vampires and zombies fighting? Well, no matter what, there are more disadvantages in this rent than the title. Like this one; there was a virus sweeping America and creating a coma like humans who are leaving acting like a lot of ordinary tourists. And yet there are only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem besides one shop is everywhere deserted. You'll definitely see a zombie wandering around in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact, I think they roamed in a circle of forests again and again because they did not have a budget high enough to shoot in a wider location, or that the director did not want to waste precious time filming different films. There were vast areas of wood that were busy sitting in a trailer She starts to take care of such trivial things. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing it that he did not have enough time to hire a cast big enough or even an editor. So the eight members of the team were asked to wear their clothes as different people and try not to behave inappropriately, while I assume he changed his name and began randomly interrupting the rollers. "Editing is not a difficult task anyway?" The only reason that this film found its way into our bag is because somehow we got confused with Freddy and Jason, and the strange thing about how these things happen is not it. The only way we made it though the night was by tying gas masks to our skulls to avoid stuttering this annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yes we laughed at the end, but I'm sure one does a lot when he loses his mind ...........................
