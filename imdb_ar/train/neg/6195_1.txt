Bad feet. Terrible acting and the end seemed to be a run out from nowhere where the film was frankly not less boring. It is shocking that this film is an award-winning film at the Gijon Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It was all coming out of the theater of the same mind - what is the purpose of making the film? The references to Iraq were either strange or not properly thought out. I was amazed that this film was released - very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, the review is terribly negative but we hope to deter some people from making the same mistake. Oh unfortunately we did not have a Q & A at the end of the movie - now it could have been interesting.
