Without anything better to do, I decided to check out "Aztec Rex" (as it was being invoiced) for its inferno. <br /> <br /> The silly story may have played better if dinosaur influences were convincing. They actually looked like animations (those harsh designs that artists later use to end CGI effects, add more detail, smoother movements, etc.). <br /> <br /> The only recovery factor was the beautiful Dichen Lachman named Ayacoatl. I have kept my interest. If only the budget was raised and it was possible to use some disguised dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the crew and crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was filmed.
