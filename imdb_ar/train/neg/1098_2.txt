I got this movie in a $ 5 box at Wal-Mart. I would not recommend watching this step. I would give it to one of my friends if I was angry with them and I wanted to suffer them for two hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and took a quick look at the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I had known how boring this movie would be before you run it. It was my fault to think that something would happen in this film. It's just about a group of people moving from camp to camp. The soldiers training the soldiers treated very badly and the main character trying to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well, here's my scream about this movie: To me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies you put in and you're stuck watching it because you want to turn it off but hold on to a series of hope that you'll catch it in the end. No. After the film ended, I passed behind the TV, because I was angry about wasting almost two hours of my life watching it, and ten minutes more writing this review to warn people of it.
