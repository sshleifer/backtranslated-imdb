I am a fan of the B-Rate horror movie and I watched my fair share of slant pictures, so I have a great measure to judge this film. It ranks first in the worst horror films of the 1980s. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, and it's not as scary as Re-Animator and lacks the value of the camp there's Nothing Out There. That being said, this film has no value. Keep in mind that the artwork for the movie is for a completely different movie. Snapshots that appear on the back of a DVD are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> Violence: $$$ (There's a lot of violence but we've seen all of this before.) A killer kills a good marriage for students and a member of the facility sometimes by slitting the throat and all other killing methods used by horror movies). <br /> <br /> Nudity: None <br /> <br /> Story: $$ (The story focuses on Fransine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this film was produced - which accepts career teaching In a university, people start to die and Forbes thinks the killer is targeting her. "To be honest, it is impossible to pay attention because the text does not embody any character outside Forbes. <br /> <br /> Representation: $ (very bad at all levels) Sense of school output - high school This is because college students can get a better click.Forbes offers a small amount of talent as Seminara does as a student, But everyone else is a caliber "extras" representation).
