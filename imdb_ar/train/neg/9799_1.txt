Power Rangers, a horrendous child show from the 1990s, still bothers young children with full cheese and horrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not fun, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing children fighting each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The games were an additional demonstration on how to promote a violent TV show like. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to see the purpose of this absolutely ridiculous show at all. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever presented.
