Michael Jackson was going to get a place for his character in The Gold Child, and because he loved the kids. This did not work (and why should that happen?), So instead, we took Eddie Murphy to save the world by saving Kid Kidas. I would strongly suggest to all future screenwriters to carefully study the actor's actor dialogue in this exotic fantasy - adventure - comedy that is a step closer to Ishtar. Whatever Murphy says or does can be better liked, but do not miss his brilliant comedies; does not belong to this movie, and the same applies to DR. Doolittle! Violence and visual images combined represent reasons for its design as a classic game of a cult camp, and that would have no meaning because Hollywood and film enthusiasts continued to make money on men. When talking about visual images, they were released well in Ronald Reagan's reign. Murphy is much better in the movie "Moving to America" ​​and 48 hours, but this senseless film is not my touch of golden honey to taste crunchy.
