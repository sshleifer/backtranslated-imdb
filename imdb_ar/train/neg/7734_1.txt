This movie is the worst film I have ever seen. The storyline is weak - I could not even follow it. Acting is high school. The sound track is annoying. Humor attempts are not. Editing is terrible. Credits are slow - I will be embarrassed to have my name associated with the movie's waste Do not waste your time thinking about this attempt at acting.
