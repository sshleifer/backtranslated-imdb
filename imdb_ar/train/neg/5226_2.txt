This was one of the most popular films we have seen in the last few months with a predictable plot line and largely misconduct (mainly from supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on DVD was actually rewarding over the film itself ... <br /> <br /> Obviously Hugh Laurie has done a lot of work in learning how to dance on Samba but the scope of his character only requires that he submerge Same at the end of KDE for the swimming pool. The film depends on the appearance of a beautiful girl and great music, but these films are not enough to provide good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rio or a British bank, this will be you. 2 of 10.
