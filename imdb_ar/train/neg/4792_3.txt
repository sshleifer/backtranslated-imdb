Phantom .... degree. Phantasm II ..... Wonderful. Phantasm III ..... awesome ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I like to stick to this film, I simply can not. The film seems to have been "sold". The first bad signs appear when the video includes trailers for other movies at first (something others did not). Also a very large number of stigmatized characters, a notable example of a child (who is considered one of the crack shots and funny at first but you want to kill him soon), and the woman who uses karate to fight the balls (does not work (does not work or should not)) (What the hell are doing there, and there is no link to them in other Phatasms). Also there is a severe shortage of dwarves that work. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the beginning of the crack, and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER may appear) </ br> <br /> To me, Fill between the second and the fourth where additional characters are left at the end so you can follow up with the 4th figure in the fourth. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing. 3/10
