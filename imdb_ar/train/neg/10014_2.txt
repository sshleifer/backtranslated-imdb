I saw this movie in a car in 1959. Even "Howard the Duck", I considered it the worst film I ever saw. Try this movie to combine all the races into one; comedy, horror, teen rage, and hot stick that must have been labeled "Mom, Car". Maybe it's worth a second watch to see if it's an accurate reflection.
