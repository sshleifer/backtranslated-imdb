After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie I was disappointed because of a lot of changes. It is understood that books and films are different but they were two different stories, leaving only names and some stories of the book. Read the book and you will get a better understanding of the film. The book gives you a better character development. These characters are very interesting and make you care about them. The sites were already in line with the descriptions of the book. Some characters not included. The TV has microwaved many books and great stories, and this is a perfect example. The author's input does not always provide a good film, but it can sometimes help.
