I have now seen all four Bo Derek cars run by her husband John; all are very bad, of course, but this is definitely drilling. Featuring a usual flimsy plot, and bad programming? By the manager, of course? By acting, not to mention the unwarranted nudity of the star, he deals with the loss of her older husband Anthony Quinn (who accepts suicide with Venice by saying he has always been a fan of Hemingway !!) but who continues to appear and talk to her. In fact, he wants to go back to another younger body, but he really does it only in the last scene! Derek is beautiful as always, and still plays naively (!) ?? Especially during the muddled middle section chased by a tenant killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is usually larger than life (read: Hammy) here, but this easily forms his counterpart; besides, he acts through a large part of the plastic for a long time (presumably he refers to being in a state of oblivion)! It is clear that the "alternative" is a neat-looking stud that does not enjoy the curse of talent or even personal. Also featured in the film are the old Hollywood actors Don Murray (as Kevin's best friend and business consultant in Bo) and Julie Newmar (Queens's guardian angel in the afterlife)? In addition to the appearance of a sudden veil by billionaire Donald Trump (who is supposed to need this in his autobiography ')! Needless to say, John Derek was a cinematographer of his own in the film, and the final credits are full of useless expressions (and full of gratitude) for the many people who helped, and that GHOSTS can not be swept by the board at the Razzie 1990 Awards!
