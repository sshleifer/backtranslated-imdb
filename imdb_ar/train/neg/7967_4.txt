I may not be very impressed with the original "Creepshow", but the garbage supplement makes the anthology look perfect! I think I was going to expect this to love this one more. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero returned to the front in the style of the EC Comic style, and on this trip the three Steve King story scripts. However, the trend is delivered to Michael Gornick. The film often stumbles on this side with uneven garnish brushes. But most of the blame must go to the terrible, intolerable Romero text, especially (in those dialogues flowing through the first and last story). Ethical messages (which came mostly from a group of sour characters) simply acquired black humor. It was painful and the same can be said about the corrupt musical result associated with the image. Loosely linked between the three stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together are a fairly wrapped and effective story, animated in the nostalgia of the 1980s. I loved this part and Creep's personality was brightly glowing. <br /> <br /> # The Old Story Chiefhead sees two older people (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamor) from a public store in a dead community, Dead River. Get robbed and eventually killed by two bad guys dying to live out in Hollywood. In front of the store a wooden statue of an Indian president comes to live to avenge their death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy and Waffle .. Waffle on 10 minutes about his commitment to his "great" community. What a very sensitive time. Well, just like Kennedy's speeches, this is a colorless, monotonous element that never works in a good hypothesis. The extravagant text is unusual and not very well. These two factors are added to my fault. When the Indian comes alive and turns into an Avenger, the Fools meet a very fast (though awful) death in the right way. The praiseworthy effects have been implemented, but what about that free flowing hair. How could Hollywood hit this lock of hair again? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # The second story "The Raft" follows a group of smoking doping and teenagers heading to an isolated lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the podium because of an ominous creature lying in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now, this is much better, much better. What begins when you turn on primary teenagers turns into a mysterious creepy group filled with tight tension and fear. It does not even conspire to flash nudity or defamation. Totally obsessed and this applies to her sense of humor as well. The end of the irony is amazingly has a nice touch to it. The offers of nobles are acceptable without a huge sign. Hold Gornick's side on the bad side and stir. While, the annoying music result on the occasion pressed the correct ropes. The sludge-like creature in the lake (as many have said) looks like a piece of ugly black tarpaulin (yes you read it correctly!) Float on the water. <br /> <br /> # In the end, the third number ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexless woman on her way home after becoming ugly, but late. Thinking of some ideas to explain their delay if necessary, I went over the road and was shocked by mistake. Instead of checking for help or getting it, she leaves hoping to return home before her husband. Soon after, she is intimidated by the body of the dead witch. <br /> <br /> - Not bad, but I really did not go into this funny exercise at all. Compared to the first two, this one was different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead. Lewis Chills was well on the leading role, but this firm assertion and her small conversations with herself have become sternly strained and frank. The effects of a bright make-up are well presented and narrowed by vision. When you press the park, it is when it becomes overheated and cowardly and the highest level in its execution. From there onward we hear the infinity of our dead exuberant assumes repetition and repetition? He repeated the line, "Thank you for riding lady!" This happens every time you decide where jogging is. Do you have a little courtesy to the dead granny. <br /> <br /> In general, it is the second short story "The Raft" and the unpleasant and well-studied effects that raise this very low sequel.
