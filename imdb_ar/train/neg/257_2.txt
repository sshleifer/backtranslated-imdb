I love Jimmy Fox. <br /> <br /> I enjoy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit, he probably had a relationship with the middle-aged white women at the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jimmy knocks the door! HEE HEE HEE!") But ... this was incredibly annoying. There can be no sustainable snapshot of the camera, and there is no screenshot of the camera from a traditional angle ... everything has to be in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be smooth and like Malkovich, but at this point, she was old and tired. He did not attend anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, many of the lines I have seen come, a lot of lines I've heard before, a lot of "strong guy" lines ... I do not mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's little authenticity to it. In fact, the entire support team largely sucked. <br /> <br /> I love Jimmy Fox, I think it's really funny, I think it was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough for me to bear everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie required fewer shooting shots, less annoying camera shots, more feelings, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
