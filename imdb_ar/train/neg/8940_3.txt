"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for Interpol's 17th branch in London, specializing in (I think) magicians. She has the eye of fate, she is good in her hands, and dangerous if anyone else gets it. <br /> <br /> Office 17 captured a demonic Californian, Hyde (nothing to do with Dr. Jekel). Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD travels to England to return him to the United States. Lutz is a link to previous Witchcraft movies, having been played by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9. In part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; in year 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> The role of Lutz in the ninth was not much big, but she is one of the main stars in these stars. Although they are left behind by high heels and short skirts, they still have tops in this one. This time she has naked scenes and sex. Beaton is very attractive in this role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. One of the unknown club players has a deadly trio with two vampires, the devil and vampires get them with some punishment, and Lutz finds an English friend, and Celeste and her friend are captured by love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character of the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this series, although Lutz reminds him of the office clerk 17 Dickson in a conversation about the vampires. She also communicates with her partner Detective Garner (Parts 6, 7 and 9), although we do not hear the end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde was released from prison by a group of vampires led by Raven, to the Burgess rites that have to do with a god named Marsha (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines in a very flat way, while Raven runs a university degree. The fighting scenes were designed terribly. <br /> <br /> The sound in the movie was recorded very poorly and was badly edited. In addition, some dialogue is lost under the whistle or siren music. The cinema is not great either. The presence of the film in the UK was already filmed somewhat new although at least for the series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good like Celeste; attractive, sure, but most importantly she is easily the best actress in the film (despite bad fighting scenes). I am quite surprised by their very small filmography. If there is a Witchcraft XIV at all, and I bet it will be there, they should return it, even if that means moving it to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available on its own, or on a hottest DVD collection hell together with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
