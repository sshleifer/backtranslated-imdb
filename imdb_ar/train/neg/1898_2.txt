Remake of H.B. The classic Halicki chase movie in the seventies is simply terrible. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds are perfect car chase movies. Takes the original remake and stands on top of it. While Halicki gave us 75% of the car chase and 25% of the drama, at GISS 2000 we got 25% of the car chase and 75% of the drama. Crate as a super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. Modifications MTV, breast and ass. Save your money, the original rental. At least Halicki did not live to see his child (he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the movie "74"), which is degraded in this way.
