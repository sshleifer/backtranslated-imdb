The Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when terrorists block a ski resort and it is up to one policeman, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop. <br /> <br /> B-Action leases from other movies and is very good with a very good work, a silly plot (as always in these movies) and three beautiful stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as police officer, Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like B-action stupid movies, this is not for you.
