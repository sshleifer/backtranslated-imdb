Please take a minute to read my full review. I do not know the movie itself - only the DVD versions currently available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this movie up to two stars. I mean how just one movie can be rated out of 10!?! <br /> <br /> Here's how: an epic adaptive adaptation of Tolstoy's War and Peace with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the Red Army, it would be difficult to make a well-prepared adaptation of the scene, but it is worth sitting for seven hours - If that's what you see. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see that movie - anywhere as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch the version of RusCiCo DVD - widely considered the best version available because it is boxed in messages and restores scenes that have been cut from other DVD versions. <br /> <br /> But, it's one of the worst film prints I have ever seen and it was transferred to a DVD. The picture is muddy, inconsistent, and often oscillating. It will be almost acceptable if your brightness, color and image levels are maximized .... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also very inconsistent and noisy in parts, actually unheard of in others. <br /> <br /> As for languages, it is a big problem for English speakers - the Madbalij option contains some good actors, some really terrible actors whose performance is rising, parts of the film are not dubbed at all, sliding back to Russian and even French at random. <br /> <br /> The translation option is not much better. Subheadings do not appear at the bottom of the image, but above it - obscure some of the beauty (or the rest of it) in the scene. In addition, translation is often a bad translation (shameful because the script was doing its best to approximate the actual words of Tolstoy), and the subheadings seem to seep into parts of them. <br /> <br /> So, even if you set the color, brightness, and image settings, raise the volume, and choose subtitled * and * English subtitles, you'll still get an annoying movie to watch and listen to. <br /> <br /> Can content overcome this? Maybe he could, but in seven hours - who can afford it for a long time? <br /> <br /> Maybe one day someone will come and get it back - maybe later I'll see a masterpiece - but for now, I can not give more than one star for something I could only stand by watching the first 12% of.
