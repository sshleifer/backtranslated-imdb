But it has some good action and an interesting plot to some extent. Nevsky acts as a building object and does not have everything that is attractive, in fact, IMO, it's ugly. (His acting skills lack everything!) Sasha played very well by Joanna Bacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, she needed her character to be developed. There are a lot of men in this story, there is no friendship, a lot of work, very stupid way of the end. It's very violent. However I loved the scene, this movie takes you all over the world, and this is a bonus. I also liked how they had some things about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to draw my attention. The actors needed to be more handsome ... The biggest problem I faced was that Nevsky was very natural and not exciting enough. I think for most players, Sasha will be hot enough, but for us ladies who are kind to work, Nevsky does not fail. In general, this film was good, I did not like it or hate it, and I found it just another normal movement.
