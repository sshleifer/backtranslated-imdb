This film is really incredible. I've seen lots of cheap trash movies, especially "Full Moon" -Pictures, but "Dollman" is very difficult. Lots come: funny story, actors always on the edge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about her! It's a really bad movie, but it's also one of the most entertaining movies. If you love bad movies to laugh, you should see them. Do not miss "Dollman vs. Demonic Toys". It's really funnier and worse.
