You do not see this movie at all ... It's the biggest pile of photos I've ever faced. That's something to say. The acting, storytelling and filming were extremely severe this is the worst movie in the world !!! Seriously, does not this give you great success because it cost me 99 pixels of Sainsburys and was only manufactured in 2005? Hahaha, this movie looks like a cheap college movie, so you can see the camera at the corner of the screen .... although you really want to see it, you'll see the scary shark scene ... maybe the best movie I've ever seen ... Ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours ever !!
