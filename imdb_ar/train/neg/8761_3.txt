My girlfriend usually go to Blockbuster and choose movies that have never been heard before. It is recognized, at times, that it led to some recreational discoveries. Often, the best thing to say is that they definitely work an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> I brought Caterpillar's advice to the house. She was excited because the box said it was funny. Fortunately, advertising on boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This film was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies that, unless you are a slow and lazy person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you hate every character in the film. So enter a nice character one. What a annoying buzz character that will fall in love and act in a way that will drive anyone away in the real world. So a handful of unemployed and unemployed artists divide love and find success in their careers. Then, they meet with a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving personality (almost a perfect man). Then we watch the woman, the annoying nagging artist (in her thirties?) Angry and falling in love. So try to escape from the gentle and emotionally intelligent mature man and stay with the married man who had sex with him wonderful but empty. She is a slut to the man and does her best to keep him away. In the real world, it has been very successful. I definitely wanted to escape them and I was not in relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it is good that a man "fought for his love", I did not want to get it. (And she was not my girlfriend) did not deserve it. Why do I wonder, did the director think that the "almost perfect man" should be punished for the need to have a relationship with her? When the artist asked the "almost perfect man" to leave, we were screaming at him to leave too. There is a problem with the movie when you are a troubling, silly and stupid film heroine that you want to fail. <br /> <br /> After that, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh several times even though his character was so humorous. As for the other characters, they behaved well, and the characters are bankrupt and moral. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say I laughed several times in the film. Unfortunately, there was not much laughter until the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had these laughs, I was praying for the film to end very long. I needed to take out these vulgar characters from my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people hate their struggle with love for people who do not deserve, this movie is for you.
