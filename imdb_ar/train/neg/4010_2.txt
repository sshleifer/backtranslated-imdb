When I first saw the show, the first few episodes looked promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a "mysterious" vampire stereotypical and introduced herself as an independent woman. However, the show has started from here and has become interesting once-entertaining characters such as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original characters, along with their acting abilities. By Episode 5, Bell's torn eyebrows were so low that his face consisted of a front. Sookie, or rather actress, is more dead than a vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she only interacts with the extent of the pleasure of losing her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other very early in the show. The way they annoyed each other was something that made me deal with them and I could play more easily. As soon as Suki loses it they spin around like a whole set, just thinking about Bill's sexual desire and the size of his appendix. Bill also loses his spoiler attitude and is well, he is just silly. His actions are never explained but he does so with Sookie. why? Their love for each other is not going into it, if there is any love. So far sex seems to be the essence of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually equal in sex but come on. Every five seconds I see some kind of cams happen. This was not a big surprise, because HBO always tries to pass a soft porn as a decent television show. Bill appeared from the dirt and just get it with Sookie for no reason what ever happened? I laughed so hard that I almost loved myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters do not go into details about anything. All events that occur are usually unknown. The only thing fixed is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that I love simple characters. Tara and her drunk mother are more interesting than the main characters. The only reason to keep watching the show is to develop small characters. <br /> <br /> Minus sex and the main characters in the show will be more worthy.
