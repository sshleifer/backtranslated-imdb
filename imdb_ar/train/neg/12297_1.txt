Witchy Hildegard Knef blasts a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them up one by one in twisted and disgusting ways. I thought I saw everything until a sad man was crucified here and then he set the fire on his head. Hildy is also a deception: she takes an annoying guitar and stitches her mouth shut ... then hangs her upside down in the chimney in time to set the fire on! "Magic" made me ill. I made my eyes hurt. I was ready to slap him as the worst film ever made by otherwise competent people ... until the end. I must admit that I loved the end. It involves a boy and a recording of his toy stuffed by Linda Blair who seems to have a fantasy. The scene lasts only about a minute and the film ends, but you know that old saying: "If you have a wonderful ending, people will forgive you for almost anything!"
