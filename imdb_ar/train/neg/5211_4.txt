Here. No doubt Tommy the villain here. I do not know why, but for some reason, young children in horror films tend to show little food. Because they are children, they will not die. Because they are annoying ... well ... except resort to terrorism. But these are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway the movie. Can not find this movie on DVD? Of course you can! All you have to do is buy a classic DVD package! Do not just get a "switch" on the DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 other movies! What a deal! The Pakistani Federation. Okay. I did the advertising on these cheesy movies. Let's just say, this movie is not worth $ 15 on its own. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical world. Yes. All chemists looked handsome and looked like this man playing Peter. He is trying to get out the serum to stop the deterioration of the body. His college wants to pull out the plug in his project, so he tries it himself. But since this is a horror film, it absorbs it and starts an incredibly long conversion sequence that takes about 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To take out the film, he entered into a relationship with some of the women who has a son. She was not married! scandal! But of course Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... no. I'm back. He is the most angry personality. Much worse than the old crippled man who wants to take over Peter's job and spread to him while in hospital. That's right, even if you cripple an old woman, you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> So we see Peter starting to kill some people randomly in his visions until he realizes he is doing it and decides to kill everyone on his way back to normal. However, in the end it develops into an orchid. Yes, I know do not ask. The end really does not make sense. If you hope to get a really good return, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie .... It's very frustrating because there is nothing good that has paid off your debt. If you already own the 50 movie package and it's on your list, you're not a snob, but you're not in a great movie. Just sit back and relax, and eat plenty of snacks. Because this movie will not make you jump from your skin any time soon. <br /> <br /> The mole contains 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10.
