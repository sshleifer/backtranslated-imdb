I went to this with my hopes up, in twenty minutes in the film I could not have been more disappointed. Although thinking that this would be a terrible bad remake, I kept my hopes high maybe ... maybe someone would hit this time. Unfortunately, night prom on the same level of quality as the April Fool's Day edition last, bad script, bad direction, acting with terrible cowardice and generally bad horror. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, it's boring, repetitive and worth about ten eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've seen it better than a million times then this. If you go to watch a night concert in the theater (say wait for DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because you will laugh. The laughs are not at points in the film supposed to be funny, they are the response to the "dramatic" key moments in the film that you're doing so badly as if you feel watching the latest version of Scary. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or parody? The filmmakers missed the mark badly here, as a large number of the audience took part in the theater that I attended in the middle of the film. It is in the past, I wish I had done. Not me, but I had to torture myself and stick to it in the hope of getting better. Needless to say, he did not. Horror scenes are a joke, not only because of acting, but because of direction, text, special effects, and camera work. The film managed to appear as if they had spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out with a small budget movie. I half-expected to see dollar store signs on some props and I kept thinking I'd see a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> These scary movies are fine, if this is the future of great horror in the budget, the horror type will be doomed.
