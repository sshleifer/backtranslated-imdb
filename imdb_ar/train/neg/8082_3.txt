It was one of those late nights "It's There" I saw things. Sometimes they are great. This was wonderful, but it was not supposed to be so. <br /> <br /> The movie was really great. How can you fail when you have Charleston, Houston, and Jack Palance? We are talking here about the Oscar winning grass. It had good special effects. It was even some really good boobs! I mean well done, full breasts with full nipple and at one point even some beaver. But she did not make up for the missing component - Story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean that the "solar crisis" explodes things, but that was bad enough. It was the rest of the things - your evil company is very stupid and quite predictable. The guy who just smelled! No amount of good-looking ships, cold space or fighting scenes can overcome this. <br /> <br /> I've seen the members of the cast themselves very good. I've seen great science fiction movies with minimal features and budgets. All the difference in writing.
