Robert Altman, the newly-hard West of Edmond Newton's book "Maccabee", was overlooked at the time of its publication, but in the past years he has been followed by critics. Apart from the city scenario of a perfectly convincing boom, the characters here are not worth much attention, and the picture seems (unintentionally) narrow and unattractive. Beethoven, Warren Betty, plays a businessman at the turn of the century and settles in a struggling community on the outskirts of any place and helps organize the first brothel; once profits begin to emerge, my home is naturally threatened by the difficulties of the city that wants part of the movement. Altman creates a festive atmosphere for the film that gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the movement in this small, unfortunate town is limited - most of the story is made up of short essays - and the speed of Altman deliberately slow. There is hardly a statement (it is quite reversed in reality) and the actors are staring at each other without much thought. It is a self-defeating image, yet, in a quirky and trivial manner, she wears a proud defeat. ** from ****
