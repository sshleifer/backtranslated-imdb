I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this film, but it clearly has nothing to do with the Richard Wright novel, on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We've read the novel this past summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. While taking notes periodically and checking the clock, I thought of opportunities to be beaten by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I had to watch the rest of the film ... then I wrote an article of 5 paragraphs. <br /> <br /> Wright's story discussed very real topics, about the mind of the killer and the psychology behind it. About the movie Silver killer to victim, this is not what Wright wanted (see: "How was born the largest" 454). <br /> <br /> I will make this short and resolved: if you want to leave your consciousness, in the words of Rafael Lambert, fade away, skip the film and read the book. Adaptation 1986 is not a thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write the article.
