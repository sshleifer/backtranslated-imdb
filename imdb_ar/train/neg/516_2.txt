Have you ever noticed how Brett Reynolds laughed in his later films like screaming brakes? <br /> <br /> You should have been hanging out with Nedham Hal very much. <br /> <br /> From the looks of "Stroker Ace", WAY too much. <br /> <br /> Do you believe this is based on a book? I can not, but it was. Maybe not a best seller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Bert was a very young man at the NASCAR circuit, where he cut my house as a pair of fried chicken with designs on his team. Anderson offers what he cares about love, as does Napurs' passionate impression of Gomer Pyle as a loyal mechanic / best friend of lotus. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt's or Hal's. Others need to work. Even the real drivers at NASCAR are involved in the job and are looking to get more talent than those who have SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As far as laughter goes, Boba Smith (pre-"Police Academy") gets it from my house driver. Petersen, in Elvira's full mode, gets a lot of people who appreciate the appreciation as a lady you want to get to know Lugs well. REAL WELL. <br /> <br /> It is shameful that Burt threw a lot of time and effort into a film like "Stroker Ace" where it does not matter whether he's upset or not. Did not bother to write his character, why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for Peterson, and for external individuals in the end. Now they are funny.
