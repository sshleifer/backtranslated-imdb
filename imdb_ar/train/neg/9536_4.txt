Best of the best 4, better than 3, but barely. Basically, I say this because Part 4 does not contradict the 1/2 parts (like 3), (ie they do not suggest Tommy having me with siblings). <br /> <br /> In any case, I liked the Russian line plot of the story, especially the fragment of Sven Tory's original Thursin as Boris. Apart from that and despite the few scenes of fighting, the film is not something special. The limited budget is very noticeable (especially in the scene of the bombing). <br /> <br /> Also, part 4 does not actually contain any meaning or say anything like part 3, there are a few other known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in Part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of the series The characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Best of the Best seems to be the best Rhee show and, to be honest, can not upload a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw on tape, Rating: 4
