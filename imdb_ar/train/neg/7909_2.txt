do not believe! <br /> <br /> This movie gets 7 out of zero and one. This must be one of the worst films I have seen in years. It was not only bad behavior, but the story (if you could call it) was too bad. Abroad everyone knows what will happen during the first five minutes. This is not a bad thing if you manage to attract public attention during the period leading up to that moment. This however, is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark among key actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> And 2 just to try
