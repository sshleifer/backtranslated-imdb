This is obviously a DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have, several times" > And <br /> <br /> "Why do you read this book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You've made your way here, and now you can go out again!" (After driving a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (Heard to chant) <br /> <br /> - It is not clear what this film knows, in a post-structuralist era , Is actually around, or whether it is just a bad film industry. The representation is terrible, but some actors I know, are they blocking it? <br /> <br /> The old house, clearly cut by a contemporary house, is the site of the murder. A movie (bad) is basically made and the story comes back.
