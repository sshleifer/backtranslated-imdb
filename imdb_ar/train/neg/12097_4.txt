I did not much hope when I went to see this. After Mst3king out of JasonX with some friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself took seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? I am sorry, no. There are Ft13th Legion movies that cover it anyway. At the end of that day, he was a serial killer, I just would not get this sympathy. <br /> <br /> Freddy was the most interesting side of the film with hallucinations and what did not, but unfortunately, their numbers were a bit and far away, and by the end of the film, turned into a bad episode of celebrity death ... but not funny. <br /> <br />
