It is hard to believe that the film from this book might succeed in making a terrible outburst! The plot is very fabricated and unreasonable. . . Starting with putting a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the complicity behavior of at least six people and perhaps more (including the clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. After that, our wife looks like a long journey with a ferry turn from being relatively happy to kicking after a very short time. An unpleasant mother and a co-mingled, assisted, instigated and supported by a group of politically correct friends! Moving the setting off an island off the coast of South Carolina, the story did not help although it probably helped the filmmakers in the budget. It seems that the very beautiful buildings that are supposed to house the monastery do not fit an island small enough to need golf carts and these small ferry service. Kim Passenger, whom I really like, is painfully thin in this film, and certainly her hairstyle belongs to another decade. There is also no chemistry at all with any of the male threads. I completely hated the book I had extracted but read it completely. The film I kept browsing over and over, I had to leave whenever the music of saccharine became too much. Unless you love an incredible story, wooden representation, a mixed mix of religious / mythical / symbolic advice is to skip this one. Oh, and there may have been little criticism of carp, but would not it be a concerned father wearing a life jacket on a small boy on a small boat? The best part of this film is the scene
