As said before, the visual effects are amazing. They're breathtaking. I personally use a mixer and such graphics are not easy at all. But this is all this film. Not only is the plot confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to escape from who knows what. It seems that the conflict between man and nature is here. Later, when they enter the lower hole chamber, Proog explains "one step out of place and (you're dead)". Here, there is a more subtle conflict between the neglected man and nature. As the film progresses, there is clearly a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man when Bruges, from nothing, kills Emo. Proog immediately turns from being a guardian to a missing child to being a "sick man". Betray us. This depression is not only, but we do not care because the conflict between personal thoughts and actions has not developed. It is not a story about someone, through the emerging, stronger struggle. It is frustrating and does not point to the fact that there is no great truth about the human soul or the world that has been highlighted as great drama does. In my opinion, the film is heavily backward in all respects. However, the graphics are amazing, but the film is more than just an eye candy. There is no truth, no conflict, and a bad surprise. In conclusion, a backward film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
