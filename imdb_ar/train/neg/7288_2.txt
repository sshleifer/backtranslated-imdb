Note to all managers: long is not necessarily good. This film is incredibly long. But not good. The scenes were drawn in a manner, road, road, road, way too long. Sex scenes were unnecessary, often too long. The movie was modified up to two hours and 10 minutes or so exceptionally, but unfortunately it became so long that I could only give it 2 out of 10. It's much below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fenis plays an entire family tree. The person who played Grandpa does not look like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us an undue sound) are all Ralph Finis with different hair and the same head of the bull. It seems that no one notices that every child of these children looks like a clone for the last time, though taking pictures of him at every turn. This movie is simple, but if it is not for 3 weeks, it will not be annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) So no news from Germany has been ignored for the longest period of Jews being arrested and expelled is ridiculous. You may have got some words for them and you probably thought about trying to escape. Certainly his uncle in France had sent a warning to try to force them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) Love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You spend forever telling us about this and developing relationships between the main characters is very short. Suddenly ... people in love almost immediately ... Married. Then have children. Then we conclude things for 6 centuries and forget the development of relationships. Again, this will not be very stuck in a two-hour film, but over time, nothing has been offered to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was very bad. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but you will not like it either ... unless you're sadia. <br /> <br /> The director / writer must be tortured by having to watch this bloated trash on a weekly basis, I mean an endless loop, excuse me they are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this film, I mean, I think Istvan Zabo should be designing his career in directing after him. The long film which destroys any material in the film. Short description of "The Horse Whisperer" and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, the perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, you may be after dark when you leave.
