This film "Joshua" is very disturbing and useless. It actually makes me shudder to think of people who enjoy watching it. Without abandoning the story, it is about the reaction of a young boy to his newly born sister, which is just a tip of the iceberg. Throughout the film, the viewer is exposed to some of the most disturbing child behaviors imaginable. To make matters worse, at the end of this film, there are no real results at all except the fruits of pure evil by a child no less than that, who overcame a whole group of deaf adults. There is no redemption, no fair justice, and a whole host of adults who are not smart enough to know what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was very annoying. Even for those who may enjoy horror movies, this movie can be too much. Despite the fact that this film has worked well, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to waiting 90 minutes in the dentist's waiting room for some painful dental procedures.
