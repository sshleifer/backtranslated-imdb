After the success of Scooby Doo, where you are, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. Unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled Scooby Doo's success forever. They invented a new presentation entitled New, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was the Scrappy-Doo program that made this show a complete failure, perhaps for both adults and children. Serbo was a brave brave guy who was always ready to beat someone. Scobey and Shaggy were afraid of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any nasty little bastard puppy brothers. If they want Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should either kill Scrappy or never think about it. This was so bad, maybe your kids would prefer it!
