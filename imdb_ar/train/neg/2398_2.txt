Being a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa" and "Airplane", I've seen this because it was mentioned positively in the context of real comedy and irony like the above. Well, the wrong conclusion! <br /> <br /> This is not only funny, it makes you angry because it is not bad in a cumbersome way, but in a really bad way. It's bad bad. The script does not contain a single funny line, and it's on the way when you try to entertain your audience with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The handicap of Adam Arkin's speech may be the most disturbing thing in this film. However, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from smiling throughout the film and has a hard time looking at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits well with the mistakes of continuous continuity and swaying with the story - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another late-night person who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen some of Leno's movies, Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> But Kenneth Mars is good. In the few lines he gave. I do not feel easily scared of bad comedy movies, so I kept watching and looking for all the jokes almost every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> The movie actually becomes a kind of comedy as Alan Arkin takes over - literally: he starts in 75 minutes of the film in every scene. But they are very few and too late. <br /> <br /> When movies try to trick you into believing that their lack of professionalism is why you are supposed to like them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of the students who did not prepare for the exam. In these cases, you must remain firm and be "F". (But please do not assume I am a teacher, a profession that is respected somewhere between politicians and children.) <br /> <br /> If you're really looking for a horror / funny movie, you'll find it fun to watch and do not contain jokes. Try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or watch the Sunshine / Core if you prefer SciFi Schlock shallow modern bustling. These are equally funny, though not voluntary.
