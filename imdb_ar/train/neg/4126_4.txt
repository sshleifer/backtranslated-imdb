Nothing at all happens in this thrilling, thrilling thriller produced by the usual Amenabar collaborator Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with the effect of boredom and the pursuit of excitement, offers nothing in fact, and looks like an exercise in boredom. The most poignant moment is the climax in the film, which takes about 30 seconds of full painful 100 minutes, and is simply solved very severely. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every device or piece of land is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or trick. If you are a fan of this genre, see "Tesis" instead.
