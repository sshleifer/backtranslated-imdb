First Movie 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The Third Mummy Movie is almost as similar to the first film as the final result from a viewer's perspective. The story is similar and the results are hom. This time the story site is the United States where the followers of the new Egyptian priest send a mummified to our country in the hope that he can revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy plays the color of Chennai (which does not make much difference because he is not required to do much for this character). The new priest becomes the morgue keeper in the city and sends the mummy out to do his dirty work after feeding him tuna juice. Again, the girl stands in the way, where the priest falls because of the fianc√© of the scion and wants her, yes --- to be immortal with him (have not we heard this before?). The plan was foiled, of course, as the townsfolk hunted the mummy by torches (like the monster Frankenstein) and ended burning the creature's story ... How do they get the sequel ??? I think you will discover this with the following in the series ?? or not.....
