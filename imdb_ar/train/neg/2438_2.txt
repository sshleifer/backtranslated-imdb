This infamous end to Koen Wauters' career came to me through Night of Bad Taste. Judging from the comments index, I was not the first and I was the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician (no doubt one of the best in our contemporary Bob scene, so the Dutch agree on it) is a representative. Whether he must have tried or can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In "intensive care", he is very lovable, but he seems uncomfortable with the one he is participating in. No one can blame him. It deserves to be arranged in the Verheyen Hall of Fame by all means and standards. The story of the deadly maniac who is supposed to have died in an accident but is alive and angry dozens of times before, and even without the original twists, the director can present a story more than average through innovative settings and cinematography. <br /> <br /> IC has a hospital wing and a number of middle-class homes. The pace is boring. Tension loses the last part of its credibility to the musical score, because every appearance of the murderer is accompanied by a dull and threatening tone, followed by an orchestral spree during the killings, which is largely suggested and in any case bloody as a small budget can make them. Sex scene is not justified but not less attractive. The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work, though. While dealing with the subject of the couple: the full subscript does not work between the Wauters and the girl. It was possible to establish a more active emotional connection on the screen if they were just colleagues of the victim, who relieve their nerves halfway through physical intercourse. I will not give other members of the acting team a male dignity, because they all have to be cut into small fatty parts. In fact, most of them do it. The ones I remember are clear at this type: a beautiful nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> Then, in the loose, the knights come just in time to need to save themselves. An anti-hero must take out the villain, often through intelligent thinking, because the former red hats do not often get parts in these films; they may overcome an invincible illusion surrounding the killer. Translated into events, Wauters kills a doctor and saves a lady in distress. <br /> <br /> There are no people, I have not finished. This is not how the story goes. Waters is a heroic attempt, but he is beaten with anger approaching the orange orange, so it is up to the girl to capture the work of the killer of the digger and penetration through the brains of doctors. Although this method ensures the death of the killer more than the usual rounds of 9 mm bullets, only the doctor survived in order to enable the IC to reach the 80-minute mark. <br /> <br /> I should have made my point now. Intensive Care is a bad movie that can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste fans who can check Verheyen's attractive comments and others for them and try to sit down. For example, the sarcastic (unintended) value of the doctor clown mask (Halloween) and the final showdown at the park (the chase at the end of Friday 13). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude my statement by giving a few overviews of the modest items that give a little IC of credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is bear a terrible rebuke by his fellow doctor / French actor and look in a state of terror when they let him land in flames in order to mark his big name in standby. It was possible to play the role of Naked Gun again, to end it to beef, but with a longer screen time. The end may be one of them. I never saw a maniac being fired with fireworks in his gut to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good for laughter. <br /> <br /> Select one really good point for intensive care ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself completely to his musical career. Makes me wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race he has to abortion before coming to his senses. <br /> <br />
