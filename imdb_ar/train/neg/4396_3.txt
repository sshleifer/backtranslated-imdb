The complaints here relate to the speed of the film and the materials at hand. While using film and archival messages, the film has a new and interesting perspective. The items highlighted are often not very important (for example when Goebbels complain of this or that disease, tc. ). Also, the film crawls side by side in c. 1920-1939 and then over the years of war. In short, the film is slightly better than a documentary film for History, except that the director has a slightly larger sense than the documentary film editor of History, so he can arrange Goebbels more vividly. Still, I found it wanted.
