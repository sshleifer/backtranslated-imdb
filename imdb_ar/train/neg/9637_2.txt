Boy, this movie was lousy! Although I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's collaborations, I can confidently say that is the worst. This rich and satisfying woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean, where she ruled one of the laid-off staff when she was suddenly visited by this mobile poet, who speaks out loud. In fact, the entire film is just a festival to talk, with a lot of meaningless talk. Even in 1968, no one could make head or tail of this false nonsense, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. If not for the beautiful cinema and landscape, it is worth a negative rating. The only good thing about this movie is the unintended laugh at the expense of the stars.
