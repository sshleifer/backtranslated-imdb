First, let's get rid of it. . . Yes, this film steals a lot of "Darkness Falls" (2003). The "Dark Falls" plot goes the same way: The Tooth Fairy, a deadly woman who hides her face because of deformity and kills people who look at her out of revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the Tooth Fairy (who hides her face) unleashed her angry revenge from almost anyone. It is somewhat like being a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But, what you should ask is: If you steal directly from the film's fine plot, why choose a modest thing like "Darkness Falls"? Sure, she made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the play experience to some extent presented by the film. A low budget movie and direct to the video will not have the same effect. That did not happen. <br /> <br /> While I watched the opening 15-20 minutes from the film, my expectations actually rose. There seems to be at least some production value. The story does not look awful, just exploded blatantly. After the first scene, we got a wonderful collection of characters including a former doctor with secrets (the game that guy who looks like Pussy) and some of the other vets (Jennifer from the Argentine film "Masters of Horror: Jenifer"). After those few minutes, however, the film slowly decreases. It serves all the basic cliches including, but not limited to: a crazy old person with an unconscious warning, a mute, selfless jock, and a gold hearted stripper. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems faced by this film is its inability to cling to the target audience. It seems as if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone of any character on the screen at the time. When the adult was on screen, the feeling was more mature. When Star (the stripper) and whatsisface (the jock) were on the screen, the dialogue dropped to a more stupid level, and immature errors. When the child was on the screen, it looked like a ring of "Are you afraid of the dark?". . . Just less terrifying. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is everywhere. Images range from fairly good to plain boring. Writing is subpar, as for the most part. On the positive side, there are some excessive gaps in parts (including a fairly prominent (but painfully predictable) wooden scene and a very nasty gun scene.Also, if you're looking for some exciting stuff, there's a short, But if you want to see this chick naked, there are better movies to do.) Otherwise, there's nothing to worry about when it comes to this film. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Darkness Falls Does this exist?), Maybe you can check it out to see the story being done in a different way ... but, that's the only reason I can find it to see this. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 3/10 -AP3-
