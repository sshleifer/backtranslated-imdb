Of course, I did not watch GI Jane. I had to fairly watch this movie about the house of my ex-girlfriends. <br /> <br /> GI Jane immediately discovers her credibility by trying to convince the viewer that it is a real possible scenario, of course, it is not. The result is that the story becomes automatically tied to restrictions, restricting humor (which is none of them) or scenes of amusing motion, and soon become very serious. Thus the film becomes very boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> "GI Jane" fails in the success of other motion films, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and many other films are larger than life, yet do not declare otherwise. It is an escape, and therefore entertaining. GI Jane tries to be real and a failure. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with an extremely unreliable story, unrepresentative acting, and the only reason I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some artworks.
