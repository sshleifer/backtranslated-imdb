Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> F. Almost impressively bad. Notice I said, "almost". This is nothing more than a random tangle of scenes trying to loose a story. Heroes (you can not call them "heroes") shoot innocent passers-by for their food, and also steal themselves for similar reasons. There are also tons of homosexuality, which was a shift for me. (The spoiler: It looks as though the villain (who is only bare-chested and not naked as other reviews claim) is being killed early but miraculously recovering, adding another 70 minutes of public torture.) I can not get rid of the feeling that the animal has occurred Ill-treatment several times in this movie frenzy. If you are in the mood of MST3K, you may find this watch, but mostly you can forget it. Go to Rent Conan the original DVD.
