At least among those movies with 100 or more voices. Nominated for the best screenwriting script directly for the screen? Nominated Brenda Blythin for Best Actress in a Leading Role? Nominated for the best picture ?? I do not always agree with many of the Oscars, but this may be the worst film ever honored by the Academy. Writing and acting were horrible. The performance of Blythin in particular was one of the worst things I have ever seen, and perhaps the most representative performance at all times. Horrible movie, not worth the big screen and does not deserve any TV channel or cable that has ever run, including HBO (I saw it) I'm just grateful because I did not pay for watching one of the most rated films of all time.
