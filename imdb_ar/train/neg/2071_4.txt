I had two reasons to watch this scorpion when it was aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lubrigida - and here I was not disappointed. They looked fantastic. Second, through my reading of the film, I got the impression that it was characterized by a ridiculous sense of humor no different from those in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes expected (apart from some brilliant observations on the subject of war) and the figures are completely monolithic. Also, the scenes of movement were done in a strange and uninspired mechanical way, without any sense of drama at all. I kept watching until the end, but I felt bored very quickly and sat there, waiting for the viewer with Lollobrigida.
