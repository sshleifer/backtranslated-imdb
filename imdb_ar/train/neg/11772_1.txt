I will be short ... this film is an embarrassment to all but the cinematographer. The fact that she is critical of the sex tourism industry seems to be right until we are "treated" to a long dance scene. The silly plot Nobody but the most ardent BAD enthusiasts will get anything out of it. For the love of God, please stop saying that this film is a story of a lost innocence or even of empowering women because it is obviously not (childish lesbian lesbians, what the hell?). This was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh Festival (which I saw anyway), someone collapsed halfway through the film perhaps because he could not take more than that. This may sound like a very important scream but I can not really find a refund for this movie except perhaps if you consider it a pure comedy. In short, this film is viewed on a Class A cocktail.
