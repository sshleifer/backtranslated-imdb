This is the case of a group of people who think they are very intelligent and have a story that suits the time. Do you remember the comprehensive political plots taken with the camera in the years that led to Watergate and shortly thereafter? Most of the films that try to take advantage of TV intrigues are "very powerful, mental plots of mind" were actually discovered by their navel posture. <br /> <br /> I was never a fan of The Conversation I find dated as much as it was other plots of time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a very attractive actor to watch. I mean, these conspiracy films sink mostly into the Nawar heroes' character set. Lots of unanswered questions and lots of non-contact ... well, this requires Bergman to at least create a film about such invisible rules. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is an ideal example of his time: one political soup served with an ideal character and a strenuous plot tightening the network around him. There is no interesting part in itself and no improvement. In fact, you can figure out how much bad it will be from the first sequences that accumulate "Wacha" that kill the murders without offering any story. Pedestrians are directed at its worst, as most of the film is a massive accumulation of scenes that revolve around violence naively under the eyes of the viewer.
