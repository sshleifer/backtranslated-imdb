Jack London's life was rich enough in color for dozens of films about different aspects of it. It is sad to say that what his life used in the film was some propaganda in wartime that best placed on some of the less attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw the age of forty when he died, wrote some of the best stories about her. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote as anyone else carries the baggage of his own experience with him. Some of this experience on another day and time would have been condemned as racism. But this was the Second World War, and London was a big believer in the "yellow danger" where it was summoned on the day. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, and we see his years as hot in terms of his inspiration for the sea wolf. We see him in Yukon in the miners' room with a dog who was undoubtedly his inspiration for the wild call. London has been able to capture the adventurous spirit of life on paper so that the world can enjoy it ever since. <br /> <br /> The last third took his time as a war correspondent covering Russo - the Japanese war. London was socialist, but its socialism did not include people who were from the East. Like a few million others, saw increasing migration between Chinese and Japanese to the Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for whites. He defended strict immigration policies for the Orientalists. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the cart in front of the horse. London is presented as a man saw because it was at hand in the Russo-Japanese War, what Japan's ambitions were, and that's why he was as xenophobic as he was. In fact, the kind of atrocities that existed in World War II did not exist during the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but it also did so with anyone else including the United States of America at that time. But our policy of immigration caused by political pressure in the West Coast has been a major contributor to the deterioration of relations with Japan over two generations. London was part of the reason, and was not a prophet crying in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later made some films with a slightly larger budget than Jack London. If he had more money for Brownstone he probably got James Kenny or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would have achieved that role. Instead they got Michael Ochia, who was making his second film after the lady of Burlesque. O'Shea was fine in part, but certainly there was no box office. <br /> <br /> While London is covering the war, he meets with Captain Tanaka, played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specializes in the play of the Orientals in the World War II. From the point of view in 1905, the strong outlines of the best traditions of Fu Manchu aimed at the Japanese Empire to face the United States in the end. It must have ended up with a swing swing swing. <br /> <br /> Much of life in London is excluded, including the first wife. The second and only wife in this film, Susan Hayward, comes only when the film ends. I wish we had seen more of them. Charmaine Kitridge escaped London from her husband about 40 years after her death in 1955. In fact, he met Ochia and married the leading woman in his life at Jack London. Virginia May plays a small role in Jack London and married for 30 years until Oshe died in 1973. Maybe someday we'll know Jack London who would be much better.
