Unfortunately, the film is more interested in making a lame social comment on a real event, but does not have the balls to document what happened legally. The clear message of how not to blame the violent video games (get the impression that Ben Coccio is hungry for players), or how the media and music are totally out of influence is the obvious message (so we get a laughable scene for the boys) burning all their CDs , And talk about accuracy!), But the film only gets out of punishment because of "fiction". nice try. Yes, it is a great idea to reduce the influence of the media, but how do we know the children who actually planned and carried out school fire from the media? Or video games? We do not tend, we are with this film because these children once again smart enough to give up completely the media, yet stupid enough to burn the Nazi symbol on earth? Haha I do not think so in one way or another. <br /> <br /> The film hits you on the head by portraying the lives of families, and it almost damages the belief that there was no serious defect in the dynamic family of children who have already gone out and shot their classmates. Why do everyone seem interested in making killers "natural" when they are not? False and fake photography.
