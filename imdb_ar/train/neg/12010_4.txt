The shortcut "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film transports the building "F.P.1" in the center of the Atlantic Ocean, to be used as an "air terminal" for transatlantic flights. (1932); in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933); and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, non-stop peripheral travel technology has made it more preferred. <br /> <br /> The stars Conrad Vedt (like Elsin), Gilles Ezmond (Drewst), and Lizley Vinton (Clare) find love and vandalism on the Atlantic platform. Carl Hartle Directed. Mr. Veidt is more fun to watch. However, he is unconvinced in the "triangle of love" with Ms. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The youngest participating stars are Lawrence Olivier and Anne Dvorak, respectively. Both concept and cinema have not progressed in age well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Carl Hartl - Conrad Vedt, Gill Izmond, Leslie Vinton
