When his wife is brutally murdered by a band of thugs, a young deputy is asked to take his dumb friend, forced to take rap by the gang, to Tucson for trial and end up confronting real killers along the way. . <br /> <br /> The Decoy is a real reality trap sent to video shops to draw your attention to better movies! It is modern, illogical, slow, and ultimately very boring. <br /> <br /> There are some good costumes, collections, and photography, but nothing else is useful in this vanity project by the writer / director / producer / star Justin Crinbrink, who seems to have had a lot of money on his hands. <br /> <br /> They used to make Westerners like this, and it was less than an hour long. Reduce this length by about half, and you might have something to watch.
