CQ is unbelievably slow, and I admire David Mamet. The film follows a young filmmaker making a barbarella film. Then the film began to lose me. Deep and deep? Not right. The film "Dragonfly" made in CQ faces the problem of no end. This parallels greatly CQ, which also lacks the end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to capture this film at the SxSW Film Festival. I had fairly high expectations after I just saw Y Tu Mama Tambien and many other great movies. I was also looking forward to the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy film to enter. If you're not in the 60 science fiction movies or slow movies that do not go anywhere, skip them. <br /> <br /> CQ looks like a student movie. If you recently wanted to rent an independent science fiction film Donnie Darko, it will not make you sleep.
