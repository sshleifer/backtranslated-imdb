You know that you are in trouble when the initial narrative tells you to survive. Everything goes down from there. Needless, "Matrix" - action camera lead time. The cuts are useless in video game shots. Ancient arid sea captains and foolish sailors. Crows who become skilled fighters in the blink of an eye. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for a zombie movie "Too Bad At Least Good", but this movie is "too bad, you have to stop the co-creators from making a movie again." <br /> <br />
