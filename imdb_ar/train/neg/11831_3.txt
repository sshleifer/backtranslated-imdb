You do not understand how these animated films continue, and no matter how good (or kind) they are. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my child (5,7). They like anything very moving (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I was looking forward to seeing the film with its wonderful songs. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unpredictable and unreasonable. There were laughing laughs throughout the film and it was. Of course they tried repeatedly to get cheap laughs, but they did not succeed. My son always tells me he wants a DVD after seeing an animated film, but not on this film. My daughter fell asleep in the middle of the road. Also, children believe that cartoon characters look strange. I have never heard of them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave nightmares to my daughter. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type who is looking for negativity in everything. But quality is quality, and like many of the animated films you throw there, they contain very little.
