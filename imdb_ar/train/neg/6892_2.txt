My God. This was a real mess that could not help itself. Jeffrey (John Hider) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and is not planning to go anywhere. Until his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) may marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been a good film if Jeff did not play Jeffrey in an annoying way, there was never a chance to admire him and even worse. In the end, we are supposed to love him, but there was no reason he did not change from the selfish rudeness he had at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even seem to be trying and be in a terrible situation after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the terrible chemistry between Hydr and ketone, and where should their mother and son be believed? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Fares although she does not seem too interested too. Apart from some small smiles, this movie is really not worth being called a comedy just because it has nothing to laugh at! If your mood is in the flick of Diane Keaton, watch Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this arduous effort.
