Ben & Arthur COULD was 10 years old. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, screened and produced this film. Sam must have given his idea to a good writer and director and leave it to a person who can act. This is a good example of one person controlling the entire production. No one was telling him, "Sam is bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett's representation of Jable was the only good point, but he could have been much better with a good director and best actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad and I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). The acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. You just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A good second point .... This would make a great movie history. After the first two minutes you have stopped watching the movie and pay more attention to your history!
