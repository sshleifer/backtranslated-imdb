spoiler!! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham Carter, and I love them together in Frank Shelstein's film for Mary Shelley, but this - I can understand the actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but in fact - the script that was attached, Bonham Carter's elegant clothes, was possible to have an accelerated "madcap" sequence from time to time serving as part of the Beatles' film, or Rowan and Martin Lau-in. <br /> <br /> I did not understand at all - other commentators say that Branagh's character was as soon as possible. I never felt that. He was a loser, not very bright, and certainly not loved. The business with the thief bank was just a painful camouflage to watch. Definitely not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Bonham Carter's realist attempts (one assumes) that realistic speech was more difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire dialect in "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic end, which he raised at the top of a hill with its burial under the brutality of his plane, was highly orchestrated. Was there a chorus of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to classics or something with his spine and bow. Donate to this PBS. <br /> <br />
