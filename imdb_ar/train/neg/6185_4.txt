My first evaluation of 2010 is "In Blue 2: Reef". The story is about divers Chris Carmack and Laura Vanderfurth who like to explore treasures hidden in the bottom of the local reef. One day after the exploration day they are contacted by a couple played by David Anders and Marcha Thomason. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore coral reefs and find a rare artifact about the hidden Columbus treasure that was reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, diving to the bottom of coral and coarse after a full day of snorkeling they find nothing. A few days later, the hired trolls discovered that they were part of a major murder plot they could not escape or would be killed. They were hired to find large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core. <br /> <br /> The film also contains a background story about someone else (brother of the leading character) trying to fix things with his girlfriend, I think this part was a waste of time, and this also includes a steamy sexual scene between the couple, which is for me A complete waste was not required to be displayed. <br /> <br /> The film has good underwater photos and blends colors well, which is why it receives 4 stars. The Blue 2 is the only sequel by name. No original actors or personalities come back, he has a stupid scheme, stupid characters and a dull climax.
