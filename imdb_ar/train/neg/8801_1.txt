It is certain that Frankenstein Munster (Wick, Ron Burgundy) is not a sight of the painful eyes (something you would like to see twice ... ..maybe if ever One for that matter.) <br /> <br /> More often than not - relative relations between the scenes in the WURB are proportional to a third person narrator. The most troubling thing is that the characters in the WURB do not correspond to the versions themselves that we had at the end of the Anchroman (in the opening narrative that we were told that WURB is occurring shortly after the original.) At the end of the Anchroman, Burgundy grew since the beginning of the film and embraced the presence of a common anchor / Lover. In this film, he returned to his immature and immature works through phone calls a joke to Veronica (quite obviously she is more of the same scenes than the original Anshurman that was divided into WURB.) <br /> <br /> The part that makes this film, The story evolves constantly, and includes clan stealing bank without cause called alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit down. This part of the original scripts for Anchorman has been canceled. <br /> <br /> The majority of other scenes that include our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternative / deleted scenes from the Anchorman channel. They go to the same concert as in the original scene, the same original group that revolves around having a woman in the team, and the same cat fashion show clip that Veronica had objections to. <br /> <br /> Burgundy re-establishes its first date with a driving spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at its favorite club, Tennos. None of the characters mentioned that they had been in the leadership position before, and when they entered Burgundy to Tenus with Veronica, he presented it as if it had never been before. Oh, they are wearing the same clothes as in their original date. <br /> <br /> However, I have to give some credit to filmmakers - even if WURB is not the most clever way to view deleted scenes linked together with narration. Between my story Ron Burgundy - this is the weakest story. Looking back, it is great to bring Anshurman out of the ashes of WURB. You stay stylish, IMDb. thanks for your visit.
