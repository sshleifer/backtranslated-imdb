I grew up and I read Modesty Blaise, both comics and books, and she really is a heroine for me. Although he was not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was interested anyway to hear a few years before he thought of making a movie: Can he finally give Modesti a wonderful treatment on the big screen she deserves? I heard about my "humble name" a few months ago and checked the stars I was given here, and I was not too surprised to know that the result was not very high, because beloved characters often find it hard to melt the masses "heart if it is not done exactly. No reviews and watching the movie instead, and well, I just finished watching it, I'm amazed, sad, and yes, very angry, too.I'm sad and angry of giving over an hour of my time seeing something as wonderful as Modesty's Belize character that turned out to have no movie Which gives it to the viewer or fan. <br /> <br /> It seems that almost everything about this movie is without a Level and unprofessional, although I have to admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so I can not blame them.But the script and output ... oh my God, why even make this kind of crap with production values I do not know the background of this film, I really do not want to know, but I can not help but wonder how on the ground Tarantino can say straight face that he loves humility then Put his name on these? I have lost a great deal of respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for this post, and I can sincerely thank him for sabotaging my night. <br /> <br /> I was given this 3 star movie and those stars go to the actors and the professional quality that could have been worse. The other seven stars lost is unless the film is well in it. Well, I hope there will be a serious production of the Blaise Modesty film at some point containing some other non-money-stealing goals from Modesty's fans. Although people like Tarantino make decisions, I do not hold back.
