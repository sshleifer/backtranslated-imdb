A reasonable effort is a summary of this film. The 1960s movie is good but lacks any sense of accomplishment. Maggie Smith made a decent performance that was reasonable enough but not as good as she could have made, and the other actors were scary! Horrible photography. It was not very funny and therefore did not really realize its types because it was not particularly funny and was not exciting. The only kind that has been achieved on a satisfactory level is romance. Target audiences were not targeted and the movie sent confusing messages. Not a very basic plot or a very basic story at all was left well and people left puzzled by why they did not film well and who was the target audience and so on. Well with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
