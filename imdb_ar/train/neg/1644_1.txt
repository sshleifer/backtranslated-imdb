My hand is the worst film I have ever seen. I did not think something would lead to a Last Action Hero, but that was not easy. The film revolves around three solo people who meet on Sunday to discuss their sexual escape from the weekend. A fourth man - married and - formerly part of the group - appears and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny but are repeated throughout the film. Big kicker at the end of the funny film. Avoid at all costs.
