This film relates to Eddie's story as mentioned in the title and its return to old friends in a coastal community. This plot involves a group of friends where it turns out that Eddie left as a means of dealing with the death of a friend who somehow feels responsible. But this is illogical, since the choices made in production are very poor and not fully realized. It does not always have to be "talkative", but it should at least help develop the story. Here one-line attempts such as "I just took off" or "I know you do not have love in the heart" just evoke something worth the audience's time. And also when the writer loses his where to go to the next stage, moving to a musical editing of the protagonist walks through the fields to some independent mood music. Talk about trying hard. If you're interested in a good movie, the kind that gives quality and content to elegance only, this is not the right movie for you.
