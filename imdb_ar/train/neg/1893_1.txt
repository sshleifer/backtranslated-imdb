This film became very ridiculous when things started to happen. I was not very interested in any of the characters; Susan Walters was very upset, and the leading actress (I forgot his name) was hit by my nerves. You can not remember exactly how it ended, etc., but the whole idea of ​​foreigners who have human bodies and they all seem stupid in this film, but things did not work. My father told me it was a stupid movie ... I must listen to it.
