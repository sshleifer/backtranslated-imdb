I love watching Jerry as much as I love the rest of the world, but this bad excuse for the basic porn flick is an unnecessary attack, lacks anything resembling wit, and works only as a means of self-promotion for Springer. Although the show runs for 90 minutes, the film goes on frighteningly, and I had to feel good. Simply awful.
