City girl Meg Tilly receives a terrifying phone call from her mother, who is visibly shaken, and returns to her home in the rural digs of her family, just to face the mystery: Why do all the residents of homes behave in a strange and unstable manner? The thriller, which barely hints at ecology, makes small town dwellers rumble, including (funny) two women staring at each other in a public place and Tim Temson receiving verbal attention from a girl on an office chair. The picture is very silly for words, a waste of grief and quiet intensity on the trash while forcing himself into a corner that we can not hope to get out of. Some of the films made by Thomas Del Ruth are good (especially the series of fire that has been placed inside the garage), although he is let down by the mysterious editing - and somewhat pathetic ending. A simplified script has a surprise and does not shred originality. * 1/2 of ****
