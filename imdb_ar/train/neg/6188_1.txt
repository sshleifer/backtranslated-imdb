This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre that I've seen. It is uncertain whether the screenwriter had read the book Bronte or not. George S. Scott is ridiculous and humbled like Rochester - when he is not just angry at the old acting. Susanna Yorke has the most dating hairstyles dating back to the 1970s and I saw her in the movie Victory. The characters hardly speak to each other, so the book's rich joke, which is the basis of their constant intellectual love, has disappeared. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please, rent a copy of Timothy Dalton instead. This is true for the book, it is like reading the novel aloud to you. Dalton is as wonderful as Rochester. C. s. Scott is laughable.
