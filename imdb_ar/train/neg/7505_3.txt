It turns out that this long-term film is not about Berkowitz and its impact on New York City, but about cartoons of a certain group of Italian Americans, known locally as Guidos. The problem is that "Guidos" is uninterested, regardless of the type of story or place they are immersed in. They are actually live cartoons, so Lee only inflates them, instead of just filming them. <br /> <br /> When someone has a caricature of his own, does not go home and says: "Hey, let's make the ears and nose bigger!" That's what I did in this film. The most interesting characters in the film are Adrien Prodi and Jennifer Esposito, who want to escape Guido's lifestyle. Set it up with an interesting story for characters, especially John Ligisamo, and you'll get a nice movie to fall asleep. Especially since it is a long period of operation. <br /> <br /> One more blow against him: For someone who claims to be a Yankee fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is incorrectly written in the final credits.
