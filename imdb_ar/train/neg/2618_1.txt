The same plot, with the exception of the story excluded from it; the most intelligent and annoying parrot in the world; Tim McKinherni proves that he can not do comedy (anyone remembers Percy in Belkadir but was his high place - all that has been since then) If a group of university students do this, you will throw them into the box and ask them to do it again - correctly this time. It is best that Ieuan Grufford return to Hornblower sharply, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu must disappear for several years. <br /> <br /> I may be too harsh; after all I could not sit through the whole movie. I get 1/10; just because I can not give it 0.
