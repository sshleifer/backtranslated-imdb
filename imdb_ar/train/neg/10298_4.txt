Lynn Ramsay makes timed images, and Samantha Morton can summon emotions with a gesture. What a drag to discover their lost talents on this polite tombstone. <br /> <br /> Ramsay can not bring Callar back to life. Her attempts are very intrusive and oblique. Again and again, her camera hung on long silent shots of the painful actress as if she were looking at Morton the mutant on her own able to provide personal. We in the Warholian hole are empty of self-immersion: for a film that has minutes to keep it on mistakes that creep across the ground, you might think it could fit to hit the protagonist. But how would she do that if she rarely spoke? Without the inner monologue of the novel, celluloid morphine calar is not anyone. It is a small wonder that Ramsay suffers from Morton's undoing often. <br /> <br /> However, the first 10 minutes were admirably disposed of, shot and edited so that my hopes were high. Give the film a lot: it knows how to make promises, if not how to meet them.
