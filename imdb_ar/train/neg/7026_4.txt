On his birthday, young children tell his mother that he is not her son, and that he wants to go back to his real mother's house. <br /> <br /> In some ways, the comedy de Innocence feels like it comes from a different person. The time of filmmaking, perhaps the 1960s or 1970s. He certainly reminded me of Losey Secret (1968) and Full Circle (1977) by Richard Loncraine, both of which deal with the loss, sadness, and relationships between parents and "lost" children (oddly, both starring Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three movies are full of non-sympathetic characters acting in strange and unknown ways. All three films have a cool feeling, emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and eventually all three films ask the question - what is reality, what does it imagine? <br /> <br /> It is beautiful but flawed, does not offer easy answers and leaves a lot of comment, unexplained and strange.
