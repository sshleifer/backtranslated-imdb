I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio production. I love movies with stars and I love those who show anonymous names. I like drama, comedy, action adventures, science fiction, puzzles, westerners, any kind except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and even love bad movies, because almost no film fails in entertainment or entertainment on a level. Except for the program "So the Cowboys Get Your Blues". <br /> <br /> When I attended a late-night show entitled "Cowboys", I joined an audience of about 10 years ago. Less than halfway through, I stayed alone. Soon after I can not afford the annoying mess that unfolds before my eyes, I also left. To this day, "Cowgirls" is still the only movie I've ever come out of. <br /> <br /> I do not quite know how to describe this unlinked, trash-free, meaningless film, or how to properly convey it without a replacement value. Suffice it to say that it is classified as one of the worst major films of all time, unbearable and unforgivable at every level. She tries to be smart, but her conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. Trying to be funny, but the humor is rough and worthwhile. This is one of the few films that have been able to desecrate her spirit, by portraying the Ansar in a subtle way of rebelling against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Waterworld" and "Ishtar" anything else. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read a book instead.
