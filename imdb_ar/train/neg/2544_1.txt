Gung Ho was a good idea, but it requires a lot of demand from American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this film, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and persuades a Japanese car company to come to America and help the town of Pennsylvania die. There are two things that come to you: First, why does a Japanese company come to America to manufacture cars when it does, as well as in that? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds go to Third World countries to manufacture their products to escape US labor costs? It makes the premise of the movie that the world's first automaker will go to one of its "best rivals (except Germany) and put a factory there as unrealistic." Keaton was still in comedic status by this time. He can prove that he can move from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still does not embarrass himself, but director Ron Howard can not prevent this from becoming a television film that ends up being anyway because they have to give an unlikely end story Happy to policy and problems of Japanese and American relations do not carry o Happy Days, felt by Laverne and Shirley, where the producers of both television programs produced the film and then produced the television version of the film, giving the film a light sense: American workers feel that he and other Japanese can learn from the Americans Man No. 2 Saito, Who supposedly did not like Americans, did not think so much.You would be better to have all the Japanese characters like Saito than soft handball characters who made the Japanese out. It would have made the film more interesting.
