Two of the films we love are (1) Western, and (2) films from 30 or 40 years ago. We must love a man called a sledge. But ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this picture is rejected, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since there is no one in the story (good or bad) to warm up, there is no one to stimulate the commentator necessary to keep the viewer interested. There is no intimate friendship between men who try to steal gold, nor intimate friendship between those who try to protect it. Sledge owns a beautiful girl friend, but there's no reason she flips around the guy or why you want to be in the same room with this pig without an account. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers from my intrusive and vulgar music score, from the very bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 films rented from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the rocky corner, the only real luxury in the collection.
