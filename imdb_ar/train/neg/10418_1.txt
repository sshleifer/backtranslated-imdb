This is not a children's movie !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under the age of five. For a month, I will ask my four-year-old from time to time to ask me "why was this rabbit bleeding from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (This was not the worst). We stopped it for about an hour and a half but the damage happened. Maniacs are hard, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he has finally forgotten everything miserable. Anyone who decides that this movie is marketed to children should be raised for a fee. ... (go ahead with my blame, my conscience is clear.).
