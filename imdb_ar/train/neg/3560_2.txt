For me, this is a story that begins with some ridiculous jokes about Franks' fanaticism when he travels with a ladder, and when he sits in a business meeting ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour, you'll see the same delusions / ridiculous positions over and over again. This is expected. It is done more like a TV story where you can go and go without missing anything. <br /> <br /> Felix Herngren loves Frank's role, but that's not enough even when a comedy has to have more variations and type of message to the audience .... <br /> <br />
