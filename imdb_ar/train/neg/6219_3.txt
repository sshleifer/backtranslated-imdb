When the MAGIC of LASSIE was opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to think it would be as hot as some of the first Lassie movies. No. <br /> <br /> The story was very bad, and Sherman Brothers songs were far below their usual level. The characters were uninspired and James Stewart and Mike Rooney saw much better days. Then, too, I was interested in seeing what ALICE FAYE would be doing, where she had been absent from the screen for many years and had always brought her previous roles in Fox. Also not, I took because of the stupid text and strange imagery. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here, nothing remotely interesting so that an adult enjoys it - and obviously there is no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this one without losing anything.
