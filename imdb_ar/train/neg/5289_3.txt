I love Jane Austen's stories. I have read only two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I call "persuasion" from my bookcase just to get out of the story and also because I refuse to believe Jane Austin could have written such nonsense. To me, I thought that if you built a film on Jane Austen's novel, you could not really make a mistake. Will be largely transformed by default. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, where are the characters you sympathize with and admire? You must have at least one granular personality to make the audience invest their feelings in them, and this has not been achieved. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to meet, but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story, they come together. Instead, I had to resist urging to throw a cup of tea on the TV and keep watching it until the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was quite annoying, and in the end, I have no idea why Wentworth is so fond of her, because nothing seems to be attracted to him. It was a deposit, nice, boring, socially inadequate, and stumbled like a lamb following everyone's instructions rather than thinking about it. This can still work for a lead character, if you do it well. This was not good. <br /> <br /> Other characters were only subjected to different degrees of narcissism, which was Mary's worst, with the complete narcissistic personality disorder. Ms. Bennett at P & P had similar defects, which were still gracious, while Mary was more than a strange show. More hateful than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very handsome and looked like a kind of decent guy. For the most part of the story, I was just wondering about the type of person who was and why he was in love with Anne, sure, he's the kind who wants someone a little more ... alive? Act wisely, not much to say, because I interact more with characters that are filmed rather than how well / poorly performing people are acting. Anthony Head was excellent, but once I saw him, I did not expect that at least. <br /> <br /> The story is also very confusing. This was not the case until the end of the film, as it seemed Elizabeth was not my father's wife, but in fact a sister (still not 100%). The story of Anne / Wentworth was the whole background a bit vague. They were together but then they broke up and both were bitter about it? How so? I was wondering this for some time, and it seems that the explanation is that they threw it because they convinced it so? But it was said in a kind of "by the way" that it was almost lost, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when the essence of the story ?? There was also a lot of name dropping, but there was no real sense of who the characters were. This person is Louisa for example, who are they? Friend? a family? What? The identity of the different characters and their relationship to each other were not clarified. Mrs. Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were sister and sister, felt very unrealistic because Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother. <br /> <br /> The final kiss, yes, it was strange to both kiss them on the street but I did not really think about it, because I was too busy yelling "Do it already !!" On TV, because Ann's blades tremble, tremble and tremble as I feel ages before she actually meets Wentworth. Get some frequency, but only for a few seconds or so, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there is the camera's working problem. As a regular movie observer, you do not care about angles, unless you decide to look for them. I did not decide to do it here, but I still noticed them. To me, this means that filmmakers are not doing a good job. There have been many conversations with the extreme close-up of the face, something that should be used only when there is an important point to be made. In this adaptation, it was used excessively and thus lacks sense. The feeling of hand sometimes also did not really succeed in the period drama. The camera works in the scene running in the end I also felt contemporary. (Not to mention jogging himself). This was the only adaptation to Austin that caught the Austin season for ITV television. Makes me wonder if it's worth watching "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or whether I should read the books and leave them there. I'm sad to say, this adaptation of Jane Austen did not enjoy it. Maybe I'll see the 1995 version instead. The BBC is known to have made beautiful Austin modifications above all.
