This is the only film I've ever come out of. Bad Representation - Bad Plot - Bad Representation - Bad Direction - Bad Cinematography - If they have started to do a bad picture they could not have done better. I hope they are proud of Turkey. I'm surprised anyone associated with this movie was hired again in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
