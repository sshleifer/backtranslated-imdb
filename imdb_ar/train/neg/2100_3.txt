You think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without having to make up for things. However, it seems that this documentary needs to shed everything in the lightest possible way. Talks about the risks associated with lunar unity and mentions the almost fatal Armstrong incident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had a relationship with one another. It makes the problem of overloading the computer (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence look like a disaster nearby when it was just a nuisance and not a threat to the crew at all. "Thirty seconds" is required to mean thirty seconds of residual fuel before time runs out, when abortion is actually thirty seconds mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a documentary or theatrical for Apollo 11, go to "From the Earth to the Moon" or a PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
