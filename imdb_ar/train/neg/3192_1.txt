What the reviewers left and the MST3K is the best part (and the only unforgettable scene) of this otherwise horrific film: There is a very good scene of rape during rape committed by the bad man (Ben Ghazara) on Maria (as mentioned, later killed by no Efficiency TJ). Rape may be very strong, "mating rituals in prison" may be more appropriate. The background behind this opportunity, but the forced meeting is the mob that is hiding the "Ben Butcher", and he knows the girls hanging in the pool. A thirty-degree blonde is upset, but our wicked one must be very fond of her, because engagement was at that stage. His first move is to try to sink it, until the mafia without his donor tells him to stop it. Pretty much like the girl she did not like in high school, but you still want to get physical knowledge anyway ... Let's just say, I've realized it in Cabana later.
