It's arguably the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have great appetite for horrible (and good) movies. She could only manage some kind of humor in teenagers if she constantly showed up in the tongue - a Rocky Hor Picture, which was really very funny. Other movies, like PLAN NINE FROM OUTTER SPACE, can be funny while trying (apparently) to be serious.

There was one decent explanation - an explanation of the older golfer's breach on a motorcycle.
