If you want to see a puzzle, do not see this. Although there are elements directly outside Elmore Leonard's territory, this is close to a "Dynasty" episode where the director focuses on "personal development" - the long boring conversations between stupid and uninvolved characters. Some people can produce great movies without real work (see "Exotica"), but not this movie. Avoid it, especially if you love the actors involved in this one.
