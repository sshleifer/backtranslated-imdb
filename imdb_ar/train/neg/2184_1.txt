This film is a loose collection of incomprehensible simulations and poorly designed plot machines. <br /> <br /> History of the film: The director of this film was a pervert on the city to portray slum women. When his wife discovered the movie rollers, he was forced to overcome the story quickly. He claimed he was making a film entitled "The Brain Will Never Die". In the end, he asked his wife to show her a "movie called". That night, he quickly filmed some additional scenes with a friend and boy "The Brain Will Never Die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Summary of story: The main character's fiance was killed in a horrific car accident (causing him to ignore clearly published road signs). He holds her head among the debris and refreshes it. After re-activating the head, go and pick up a group of prostitutes. This is pretty much what happens to the rest of the film. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the treasury. The beast appears without much explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and assume they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side Notes: The credit-end screen claims that the movie is called "The Head That Will Die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
