This movie appears to be sending the wrong message. There can be morality without the use of Christ. I think the people of other religions can enter paradise. I'm a Catholic going to the church every week, but I do not agree with this Christian arrogance. This is the worst film to travel over time I've ever seen and watched the schedule.
