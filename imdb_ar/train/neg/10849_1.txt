Usually when I go on a raid on a local Hollywood video, I go towards B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles behind the B-Horror film are Camp Value, Heavy Gore, a lot of unnecessary nudity, and special effects that anyone can put with a pack of corn syrup and rubber. I've hired Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since its launch, it's the first demo in 1995. The film started in an interesting note, and then when I saw Danny Philth walking around on a very clear latex mask I laughed. When I saw lesbian sex scene for lesbian sex scene, I laughed harder. I spent the entire film laughing a lot, and when I was not laughing, I was jerking my head thinking about how a million-dollar rock star wanted to make a film that looked like it was on a budget of hundreds of dollars. . The goal of this film seemed to me to attract "hardcore gothic children who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things they have invented since the Lava lamps." This film really seemed to me like 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie happened Just because you are demonic, this film has a lot of potential and it could have been a real good movie but in the end, this "movie" is just a stretch of video.
