Sure, I love short cartoons, but I did not like this one. Of course, children love it. But again, I'm no longer young (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How can this cartoon dragon be nominated for the Academy Award ?! Well, I think that's because people in their thirties were happier not so much now. At present where we live, everything must happen quickly. Look at the movies these days, and you'll get the same result: We live in a society that does not allow men to slow down. This is really a shame. I hope to live in the 1930s, because it seems very calm. But every time it rises to its lowest level, I think ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: If you love music (and frogs), you'll need to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not pour your time on it.
