Back in the day, I remembered seeing the stupid Nintendo PowerBook cartoons that had the same artwork for the show ... Then the floor appeared that this show was coming to the TV near me! I was not sexy, but I was curious ... I was curious about how bad the show was. All my friends said this offer had no real meanings and it was very absurd that straight people like me (I'm already gay) enjoyed it, so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> What a horrible experience !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are very stupid, and I hate how many vanillaels drool on Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his unrestricted name) a good man who owned a restaurant. Bad step, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is not only a losing adviser to King Dididi (who spends a lot of time at this show) and I hate the face of that company that continues to supply Dedidi with those horrible weapons to destroy Kirby. Too stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more because it was obvious that Nintendo was painful to get popular with Kirby. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will never be a little gracious. Happy!
