This title seems more like a photographic exercise than a film that should have been made public. For Dafoe and his wife, it should be fun to work together in a movie for the first time, without considering that people might actually watch it. I felt that 90 minutes had been wasted while I was impatiently waiting to develop a scheme, or even start. <br /> <br /> Try to match this movie to a genre you will not want, because it lacks the beginning or the end. I've seen "arty" movies before and this is not about being an intruder, abstract or original, it seems to me to be completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> I think he talks about himself when the only people who rated this movie as 10 are the under 18 age group. There is no doubt in the sensational scenes that it is not clear that the film was insistent on dumping on us. This is if you can call it erotic. Definitely did not taste.
