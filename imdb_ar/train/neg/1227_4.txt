Although many people here praise this film, I must warn you. He has no logic at all. I think Basinger does a good job of acting, but you can not create a thrill if there is a great lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good picture of you about the film: while Basinger is being pursued by deadly gangs who decide to sit and look at a picture you find from her pocket. The picture is taken from her daughter and she says "We love you mother". Who does something like that? What eff? Believe me when I say it is not as stupid as some other scenes of the film. Someone said that this is "a hidden gem". Well, I do not agree very strongly, it has been hidden for some reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, please, I do not even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. My mind hurts: D I usually do not mind the lack of logic if it is in small quantities, but this film is made possible mainly because of the lack of logic. But I still give it the number 4 because, although it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has a certain mood that made me witness to the end. <br /> <br /> So, if you choose to watch this, you know that you have been warned.
