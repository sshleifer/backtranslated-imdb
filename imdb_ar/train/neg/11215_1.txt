Well at first, this film looked good although it was fairly quick and although it had a budget of $ 60,000, it was good, but if you find your sister dead in a lake and you discover who might have killed her why go chase Around him and draw a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end it all backward and kill yourself? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a guide and understand who the killer is, why did not you give this idea to the police that you think you killed? At the end of the film she behaves like her sister, who was a waitress and talks to the bad guy she should meet somewhere and recorded him saying she died and what happened to her "guide". I do not know I was not happy with the result. This movie could be much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the end did not suck it badly! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do, you'll write a review here too and you will not be happy.
