The third version of the Carnosor Trio features a group of Keystone Kops military commandos trying to kill two Velociraptor and T-Rex. I give it 4 of absolute sympathy and my relatives of dinosaurs. The film is certainly the worst of the trilogy, so it can not be taken seriously. More importantly, however, watching this film I can not help but notice some interesting similarities between the trilogy "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first part in both labels is a dark and annoying film that has become a classic cult, the second is Alien, the third is a tongue-in-cheek film, and almost a dog (whether intentional or not) is rolling on the ground laughing. As with the Xtro franchise, all "Carnosaur" movies are not fully linked. They carry the name of excellence only to rally attention to "complement", I believe. "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" obviously have two different production groups at work here, but if you watch the three movies for both franchises, you'll find yourself referring to the two.
