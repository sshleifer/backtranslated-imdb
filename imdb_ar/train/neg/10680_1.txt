The spoilers are waiting <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever produced - it's that simple. There is no single quality to redeem this movie. The first ten minutes are very difficult - it actually leads you to believe that this movie will be awful and will make you at the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes hitting yourself while watching stolen and poorly run scenes without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like a fish tank, and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bottom. The characters show their advanced transmission capabilities, for example Alex Thomas, who is in the lake (drunk), and ends up on his boat in an impossible situation. Angie Harmon made a pathetic show on behalf of Kate, who got worse through a space-breaking communication dialog - space that seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader. An example would be when she said "the lamp!" In a stupid way that shows the threshold of how much the human body can swing before settling in half. Finally, the editing of this film was the most surprising and horrifying at all. It was as if the photographer were a bunch of chimpanzee scientists gave him video cameras. An example of this would be when we suddenly get the front axle of the Alex car. I bet there was not enough time to edit this movie. The ending was absolutely pathetic. Obviously the writers were trying to create some kind of mysterious plot lines that made the viewer say "Oh yeah!" Instead, we left to watch some stupid paintings of a spider that somehow fit with the storyline. Unfortunately, there is no single perspective in the millions there can save this film from being a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I give this 0.5 out of 10, 0.5 is the fact that this movie was recorded in the movie instead of becoming a picture book.
