Not exactly a new story, but this romantic comedy makes the idea a success. A young man (John Cusack) and a wonderful dead woman (Kate Beckinsell) continue to meet by chance and wonder if they are devoted to each other. Despite the promise of others ... it is strange that they still feel that their soulmate is somewhere. A little happy in some places, but Viva do not love. Being romantic I am almost bound to set up. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow begins. Conclusion is almost sweet, but the most deserving. This is not one of the deeper roles of Kozak, but those who could not beat him in hell. Significant support is provided by Jeremy Beven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is strange and funny. See this with your soulmate.
