I picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story was good, and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible he was. He walked and talked stupid all the time, it was fake and unconvincing. It's funny, the only acceptable behavior was by Alan Boyce (David), but the man committed suicide early and did not see him again, so you never know why he did it! All about this movie screaming low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! I have been tempted several times to stop watching, and in fact I did, and in the middle of it I decided to stop watching and I stopped, I came to IMDB to check the opinion of others, I did not find any comments (I was not surprised), so I decided to force myself on Deal with the pain and return to end it then come here to comment it. The only good thing that happened (to me) was the rock band theme in high school, which is parts of playing and sometimes singing on the guitar, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Too bad in acting and direction ... Terrible movie.
