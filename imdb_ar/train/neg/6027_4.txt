I grew up in Baptist and I know the story that this movie tries to recount, although I no longer believe the story. I will give the film a reputation for being as good as "the average film of the week". Somewhat interesting, medium representation, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is happier, and a little melodramatic. All those who have left behind must be the most outspoken non-Christians. The word is not the curse of any one of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor who played the role of the man running the UN declared "nuclear" as "nuclear" just like Bush. Are there some Christian rules of honor which stipulate that since Bush claims that he, too, is called by God, and that all Christians should hide their ignorance of this word in the same way as he does? Haha! I really had trouble taking the film seriously at all after that. After the incident of "nu-cu-ler", the film began to feel like laminated propaganda. I was looking for something bold. In fact, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for reckless entertainment, stop here - it is good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
