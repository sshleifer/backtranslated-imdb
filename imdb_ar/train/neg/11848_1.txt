What is supposed to be a simple general mystery plot involving a dead optimist is actually a vertical tale that inspires a group of characters (the only great actor, Jenger Rogers, in a very early role) trying to find a murderer among a small group of residents in a luxury apartment building. These characters range from completely stupid to full-fledged. As cheap and low-budget production, most of the events revolve around Rogers and her leading man (someone I do not care who is "why he really sucked") talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while being cut off by the silly detective and his head in his ass. Frankly, I had no worse time watching an old movie of this kind, and I saw some real makers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the doers did not do that, because there was no servants. But attention to the man closest to the personal server. There ya go. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
