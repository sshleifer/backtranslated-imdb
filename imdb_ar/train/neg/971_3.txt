After reading some good comments about this film, I thought I would give it an hour and after I was very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own rating. This is the first time I'm naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to shake the horror of this kind because it is by no means terrible or scary at the very least (except for a few weak attempts to make you jump unfortunately, one of which worked on me). I would say that describing this film as an exciting film drives me because I was not too happy! The film revolves around a spoiled, spoiled girl who scares several times. During these times, you visit a house you draw, and after each visit, decide to add something else to the house to make it more lively some of the features being a sad little boy also sick indeed. As you acknowledge the boy, you realize that her fantasy world that you created is actually better than the real world you live in. And until her father adds away from home to the house, because her father is making a mistake, he will become evil to her. The boy must escape from clutches. <br /> <br /> Think of it as trying to be a little more inclined version of A Nightmare in Elm Street, but it's more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is certain that my 3/10 decent will stop at least one of you watching this dirty!
