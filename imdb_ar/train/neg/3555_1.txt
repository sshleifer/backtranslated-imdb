Years ago, I went to my friend's film and went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavet. For starters, John Cassavitz was an actor, filmwriter and director (married to actress Gina Rowlands) and was nominated for the Oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself standing. Even seeing The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes was the source of any film on which he was shown. If we knew what the film was about before we saw it, we might have avoided it entirely. But we did not get out. At that time, I and my friend joked that it was the worst film ever made. Now frankly, this is not true. I've seen many bad-made movies on Friday nights on Cinemax (have you said that out loud?) Which is much worse than The Incubus. Almost any film starring Brian Bosworth is by definition the worst film of The Incubus. Surely Santa Claus defeats the Mariner is the worst film of The Incubus. However, since the Incubus has been used as a minimum I do not want to drop it. When I talk to this friend about a movie I may have seen, I will always refer to it as better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
