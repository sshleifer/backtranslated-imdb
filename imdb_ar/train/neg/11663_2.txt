White chicks, why not wear the black chicks, Oh, it will not look different at all. Can anyone give me a single movie from Wayans where they did not wear ladies' clothes? "There is no threat," wrote Jack White and Michael Costanza, a ghost that (the other Norton Treo members worked as managers). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are no jokes at all. It's just Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. There are no settings, no punchlines and no laughs. There are a lot of "I think I'll play some of Time Crisis 3." At least for me there was (5 times to be accurate). <br /> <br /> Someone must tell Kenan the Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damian (the only talented person), Kim, Rakesha, and George W. Usama Ben and Janes stops making films. It only damages the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * OUTSIDE ****
