The beginning of this film was good. You started feeling stupid after telling people he wanted to kill himself. I think if you come from such a small town, you'll feel insulted after watching this movie. They made a lot of these people look stupid and crazy. How can these people have little to do so they follow it all day. Often these people would tell him in ways to kill himself as if they were urging him to do so. How can many people enjoy little respect for other people? I also think they could have put a better end to this film. There were some good parts to this film too. Some people might like it, but I do not recommend it to anyone.
