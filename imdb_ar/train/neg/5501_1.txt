I thought that the Favorite Mars was very boring and extracted from it !! It was not funny at all. The audience sat throughout the film and did not laugh at all !!! Not even the children laughed !! This is sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they probably found someone better to play Mars instead of Christopher Lloyd !! I was really stupid !! It was not funny !! I think the talking suit was really stupid !!! In the original TV series does not speak the lawsuit and move !! In my opinion they should not waste their time in this movie !! I give it two thumbs! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you so much!!
