Overall I love horror movies, but unfortunately this fell from a pound pendi deal in the hands of my friends. We sat down to watch it, ready to fear and ended up splashing food everywhere we laughed so much. The concept is not that bad, but why they decided that the number 10 in the series would be lucky and I do not know. The worst thing about the film is the actors. The camera's work was poor, and the special effects actually were not bad if you were a vine, but overall the story failed to connect at any levels because the actors were as effective as a small mass of heavily charred elm. They were more wooden than the scale, especially the fake young actor who was 15 years old and too small to be taken seriously as any government agent. Looked more like a public school boy actually. There was a really sexy scene, it seemed to sway with the apples while a big lady was predatory and later his nappy size was hysterical, but I remembered it was not supposed to be a comedy. I desperately frustrated my mind to find something positive to say about this film regardless of the occasional flash of the breasts, but simply nothing. Let's hope the number 10 is lucky and they do not do another number, I'm not sure that my ribs can take it.
