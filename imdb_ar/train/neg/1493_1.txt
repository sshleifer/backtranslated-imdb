I really do not understand how people made this film and they thought it deserved all the work they put in it. The most perplexing are those who watched this film without feeling deceived in 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, they certainly could have found two real Irish people, some well-dressed women who could better present their lines than the washed-up porn stars sprinkled throughout the film. Sure, this bull works - but oddly enough, it is not as alarming as you might think members get rid of hot bodies (formerly) left and right stars. It is likely to have something to do with the fact that after their horrible inhuman actions, only you want them to die in pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not care at all: <br /> <br /> - Representation (Seriously, everyone sucked in. I have never seen this before.) Everyone sucked. <br /> <br /> Plot (some crazy horror movies written remotely, or at least very surprising.This movie makes no sense unless you are in the trash as it was clear from the book). <br /> <br /> Topic (Nothing we learn from this film. Nothing to fear in bed at night, nothing to think or understand, or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, ordinary music and boring text like). <br /> <br /> - Scenery (it could have been the grace of saving this movie, but no ... nothing pleases here. <br /> <br /> So, yes. If you do not care about it, you're just a horny teen with a bad taste in music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: Cinematography is sometimes interesting, wasted on other elements. Gore is very realistic. Again, wasted. But the bowel scene is classic. I agree with the mutation of the boom solve the problem of fake tone.
