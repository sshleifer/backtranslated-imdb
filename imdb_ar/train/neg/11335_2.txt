I recently watched Belle Epoque, and I think it might be great where he won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. I was amazed at the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict that took place between me and the time that the film was filmed so far was the plot of a man who falls for beautiful women and eventually falls in love with the good girl several times. Regardless of the predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film felt misplaced (such as a particular event at the wedding). The film was sometimes preached a little in his thoughts and in relation to the Franco era, the film was placed in the church. The only thing the film was about was the nice moments, the scene, and the character of Violeta being a strong and independent woman during times when women were not really connected to those characteristics.
