You do not see this documentary and Serbian propaganda Look for this documentary and you will see the facts and the truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> A series of documentary films about the death of Yugoslavia (five episodes) A novel that has been carefully collected and researched about the prolonged mass bloodshed that formed the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and which lasted almost in the first half of the 1990s. It includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with Yugoslav "concerned" parties and so on. The only real "improvement" that can be achieved for this remarkable achievement is the inclusion of subsequent developments in the Balkans since the preparation of the program. This was already done in the late 1990s to repeat the BBC television show, but adding some more recent events would help complete this detailed and impressive work. Perhaps another episode is justified? The very short title of this documentary has become more appropriate by the final renunciation of the term "Yugoslavia" by the now-defunct Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very formal late acknowledgment of what happened years ago. <br /> <br /> Not like the fantasy in "Yugoslavia: War to Avoid (1999)"
