The film mixes morality with religious ideals to the extent that it failed to create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. By offering the legal execution of the convicted murder as an incentive for the horrific end to humanity, the film raises the murderer of one of the parents to the status of martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the blueprint, God is angry because society has chosen to rid himself of the fanaticism of killing his parents by shooting them while sleeping effortlessly in their family. After this same God has no indignation over the actions of the murderer. A leading figure, a non-religious pregnant suicide bomber, gives her life in the end in a defiant but inconceivable attempt to save this condemned murderer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returned as a helpless and depressing wanderer to launch God's wrath symbolically. The incarnation of modern Christ is not only human, but also ridicules Christian idealism for all religions. He is unable to affect humanity forever, and skips unemotionally on the ends of life that humanity awaits to destroy. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself able to embody herself in her newborn child who saves all humanity in some way from the great wrath. This was also interpreted as a statement supporting abortion at some levels. This film, which tries to weave many religious themes in an exciting film, fails to raise any religious point I can clearly explain except to ridicule people's beliefs. It raises many questions that you do not even try to answer. It ignores the religious values ​​of its audience while trying to portray a foreign copy of its fulfillment. silly
