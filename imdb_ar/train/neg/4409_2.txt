With the precision of a routine, in Western numerals (from the lead type by Andrew McLaughlin, is that a wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith is fighting with thieves Dean Martin, who just kidnapped the wife of Colonel (Honor Blackman, who did not find her right place after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fist fights, shootings, strained robberies, and Denver Pyle in a supportive role ... in other words, nothing new or original at all. While speaking in low monotony all the time, Keith gets a whore (something of a shock after being introduced to "family affairs" on TV), otherwise these low-rent items squandered Keith's friendly talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice or care. Hack direction, bad writing and many funny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****
