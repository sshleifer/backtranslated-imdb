where do I start? Maybe this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The amendment is the worst ever, as the sound effects were awesome and the sound was released. Most of the film that one can see here is the crazy kicking effects, with the blurred talk in the background. I had to manage my voice in the full blast just for what was happening and what I was supposed to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever. I can not believe that people have actually put some green for this film. Makes me think I can take crap in a box, send it to the producers, and then make them fund a film about me. There is nothing worth talking about. The bad guys were bad, the heroes were bad, and the film was stinky. If you really want to know what to do when writing, editing, or editing a movie, watch this!
