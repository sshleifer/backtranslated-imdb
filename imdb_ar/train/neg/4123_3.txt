Although the beginning refers to "everything is quiet on the western front", this ridiculous and superficial version of the war does not depart from contemporary. This depicts more battles than ever before, with the first hour and half devoted to romantic and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some battles, you become lame: Did the enemy plane fly? Drop it (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he leaves. The enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they give up gladly. It-Them. <br /> <br /> Cold, inaccurate, predictable ... <br /> <br />
