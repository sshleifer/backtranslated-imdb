An executive, very successful in his career but unable to live a familiar life, meets a boy with Down's syndrome, who fled his residence. Both people feel lonely, and it seems that the less intelligent person will show executive power the beauty of small things in life ... With this argument, Amili-like atmosphere and emotional music, I did not expect that moral disgusting film. However, because there are some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes a violent young man), and the interpretation of the actors, Daniel O'Toile and Pascal Duquin, was very good, I decided to continue watching the film. French cinema generally has the ability to show something that seems a lot in life, compared to the more typical American cinema. But because of that, it is disappointing to see after the absurd end, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the executive family happiness, the cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of girls, the man waving from the sky as Michael Landon ... really bad, in my opinion The humble.
