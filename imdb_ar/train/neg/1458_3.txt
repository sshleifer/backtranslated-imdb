The back cover of the digital CD (which missed this one when he came out) praised Hitler - "The Rise of Evil" as "Victory" (The New York Times) and "Fitna" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well, do not mind publishing mail, but in fact, who wrote this word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace, is important, you should dismiss art. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Why did he try to paint Hitler's image with colors that did not exist? He was evil, but his image now is portrayed in a historically inaccurate way (compared to his love for animals, the gentle and defeated way in which he treats women), and so forth. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, so you should feel sorry for them because they are imprisoned within their one-dimensional personalities. A kind of fuck here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he ended up playing an old leader and failing a failed film (or in this case television production, to be accurate). The first was of course the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone fills 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This version is fine if it's in a shortcut and you do not have anything else, but believe me - it's best to leave it on the shelf at the local Virgin store.
