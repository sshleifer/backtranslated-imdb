The book probably did not have any experience in the military, and perhaps did not take a look at the history book, but I still give this war film, which is produced cheaply, some credit for taking a long look at the role of black soldiers in World War II. br /> <br /> The procedure is confusing and unreasonable - no episode of Combat! It has better production values, but the cast is interesting. The vision of New York giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck paid for this. The direction of art is the fifth grade - men wear uniforms for the Korean War. The weather was very bad by the time the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, not as sunny as they appear here, and I do not think the terrain resembles northern California. The scenario does not explain why black support forces are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch showing some guys holding Springfield rifles instead of the M-1s, which are likely to issue second class troops with them. <br /> <br /> This basic idea of ​​the story (a racist Southern officer driving black forces) should have been expanded to produce a large budget at the time, and it is not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the originators of this film to make the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this a while ago and I think it was made in Italy, which would make more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
