This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. Ranging from 2+ hours, and the art of drawing was completely misleading. I and my friends hired it, because we thought it would be a poor 300 man. You know, that you laugh and enjoy. No, there is nothing funny about this film, only the pain. After that, the film begins, and they speak a different language. We think, "Oh it's just the beginning." But no, from there the movie collapses and becomes like a boring book that you should read in primary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and battle scenes compete with scenes of two children fighting in a playground. Omit Cinematography, this film belongs to the trash compactor. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good film.
