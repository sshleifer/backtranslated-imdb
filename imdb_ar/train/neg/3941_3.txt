This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store is weak on English titles? You are blessed with this work which seems to be Roman cinema. However, I think it has real comedy potential. <br /> <br /> The spoilers follow technically: <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it really spoils the pleasure of watching anyone ask why the movie in the casino has a scene from beach shooting, even in the flash Back. This mystery, and many other mysteries, is still vulnerable to exploitation by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Let me also wonder aloud why good-looking people allow themselves to misuse themselves on a film like this. Sad thing.
