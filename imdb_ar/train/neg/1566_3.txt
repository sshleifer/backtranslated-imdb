For Beatles lovers with knowledge, the main value of this film is just sit down and pick defects, errors, compound events, deleted events, heavily exaggerated events, deleted persons, timeline errors, bad quotes, incorrect clothing, , Shame (shame) incorrect instruments and other rewards I just can not think of right now. Disadvantages come quickly and furious so you have to be on your toes. <br /> <br /> I did not give this number "1" mainly because of the fact that it was filmed in Liverpool and the actors (Rain) gave it everything (Lennon's character is credible and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at some point, which is important for something. <br /> <br /> So, watch it for fun, but please do not consider it historically accurate.
