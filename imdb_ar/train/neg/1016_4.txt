The film itself is not so bad; many of the comments made clear that there were obvious flaws in the text, but they were viewable. What really gives me creeps is that people like Justin Timberlake make films, plus films like this. I must admit that I never heard the name of the man before I saw this, but the moment when I seemed to be quite upset. The nonsense sound, the evil wicked face of Legolas, the position is terrible, and can not even coordinate between the three. It was said, I was happy when he jumped after leaving the disco, because I had hoped since then to be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J offer a very decent performance, which is the main reason for giving this version 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake team ... and I can not believe it.
