The moment the striker started, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is funny at best. The story line was even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> The acting was harsh and gave the actors a sense of inexperience. Expect more of the likes of Slater, Reed and Dorf. Lines were delivered as if from a robot. I'm sorry, I love Reed but she was incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorf chose a bad film to try to reappear. <br /> <br /> Continue to exit the entire movie. The creatures were not bad, but they really were not too good. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want to ninety minutes of my life again. They can keep money, but give me time! O wasteful.
