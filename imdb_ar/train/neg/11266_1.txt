Well, what do I say ... <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I still have to wonder what the hell is? The V.Dodgy camera moves in the yard at one point ... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically ill ... Round, Round and Round .... You get the idea ... <br /> <br /> <br /> VERY VERY strange accents in many points .... "those that you should know, know" <br /> <br /> Unless you get free access, pay for watching, or your partner is about to make you Draw a house or anything .. then forget ...
