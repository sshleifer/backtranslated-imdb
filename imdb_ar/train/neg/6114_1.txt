Because this is all you do during this entire movie, you get naked without good reason. When Tarzan gives birth to a snake, she suddenly takes off her clothes. Since when is obesity tight Bo? How Tarzan was poisoned by the way? This entire film is taut. They could not get the kind of animals for this movie properly. What does Orangutang do about these chimpanzees? You must have wandered out a group of a much better movie. A group of cannibalists and why she painted Bo and her father, if eaten later, may have been a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her father while hunting, approaches and acts stupidly around Phil Thor while I stand nearby. Any real African elephant that was not from the circus, I would push the butt of this boob. Any clever hunter would have started shooting at the moment he saw her. I can not help but wonder if the camera is on the LSD, because it has been showing many scenes that were slow moving, without good reason. This was not logical at all. The Strait of Boas, which wrestles with Tarzan in the water, looks like one of those 12 feet of rubber snakes that you can buy from Spencer's local gifts is flawless in this movie, perhaps from Bo flashing too much. I'm sorry, but this is the rip of the classic black and white Tarzan film, with a similar but better story. Not to mention planning. There is one scene in that I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * * SPOILERS ALERT * The scene in which he tries to save Jane and her father, make him stand close to the tap running water. It seemed to pee on someone below him. Also, he and Jin are con artists on the beach, with a perverted monkey jump and applause. She certainly took her father's death well. * (End of the Vandals) * There must be a warning from the general surgeon in this film. Seeing Bo too naked in this movie, will make you blind.
