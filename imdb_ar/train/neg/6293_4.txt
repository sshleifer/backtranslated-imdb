I had the pleasure of watching this film early and I must say that I thought it would be boring and wondered how they could ever improve in the 1984 version of the Bachelor of the championship Tom Hanks, which I thought was good ... I was right ... and all I honestly thought it could have been better ... definitely there were some ridiculous moments but it seemed they did not hit me ... the acting was good and the story well recounted the original followed but i think it could have been much better ... this movie i'm saying is For young people and young people from the heart; full of female members, alcohol and sex ... It is just another typical show of the concert film M done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.
