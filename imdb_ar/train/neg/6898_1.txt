Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script, bad redirect, bad representation, bad editing, bad voice, bad music. Get an idea? This film tries to be Western-style, it's not. He tries to be violent and violent, he is not. Trying to make a new look at the old genre, no. The actors are trying there best, and my heart goes out to them. But with such unfamiliar materials to work with, it's hard to make something shine. For me, this has all the manifestations of "the first new school in Outta movie will burn the world." New filmmakers often bite more than they can chew or budget. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, re-evaluate what is possible and work within their limited budget next time.
