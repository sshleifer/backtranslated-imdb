There are bad movies, then there are very bad movies, so that almost become an art. This is one of those films. Me and my partner are still shocked, you know, staring at the space and drooling! You can say that the people involved (I hope they change their names to protect themselves) were blown up, and certainly not shy. I give this one out of three out of ten just because of the unjustified smudge and the really bad effects. I laughed loudly during most of the film, so I think you can say that it showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the words above do not explain in any way that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass a movie with a great title!
