Who has already created this piece of nonsense This is the worst film I have ever seen in my life it is a waste of time and money. I hate that how they create low budget sequences featuring representatives of D-Lister and a story very similar to the first line. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the bargaining box sitting next to Wild Things 2 and Death To Fashion models for $ 2.99, which fools I actually thought this could be good instead, I've seen disgust Because the bad stereotypes are torn by the story line and the scenario from the first. <br /> <br /> Who I think this is true Video production was actually a decent half-film that should be a crack or something because I think most people who saw this movie thought it was a burden over !!!!
