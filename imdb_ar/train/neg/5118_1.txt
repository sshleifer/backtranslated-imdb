I am a Christian and I say that this film had terrible situations, unrealistic situations, and a full facade of Christianity. You may also see "Remember the Titans" and at least do not confuse Christ in a football movie like standard steroid for losers. Let me make some really urgent comments about what bothered me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school in Georgia was a white academic school. I did not notice a student or a single black player in school. I deal with the "Christian" white academies in the south, and they were built for no reason other than to re-divide. This is disturbing when the film is about Christianity and changing the life of Christ ... What about changing the hearts of the chapter? (Note: I liked the distinctive black coach, just like the whole white team and all the Black Giants.) <br /> <br /> 2. Non-critical praise by all Christians for this film. Can I get two people to say that he was badly acting, filming bad, bad writing and poor short compared to other movies. If we compare this with another football, will he have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-baked Christianity that emerged was less logical to me than the unrealistic end. If Christianity revolves around reading a simple Bible and praying for a complete change of life, do not wonder when someone will not listen to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ as a universal remedy. It does not need to sell and does not need to be linked to these alien lifestyles. No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be hostile to the concept with this unrealistic offer. <br /> <br /> I realize that this film may be inspiring to a few people. For most, it will not be. Will not give a true picture of struggle and heart tension. More important to me, they are not Christian by any means or stretch. They have values ​​but they are shortened as a "pull yourself up" message, such as shallow thinking. If you live alongside people who struggle and / or those who live in living conditions in the Third World, this film will be hollow because most churches are today in their religion.
