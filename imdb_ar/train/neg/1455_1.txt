She was rarely exposed to this blatant nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. Awesome joke for a movie, stumbled all the time. Hitler's famous biographer, Ian Kershaw, was originally an adviser to this film, terrible, vulgar, distorted, and full of blatant lies and half facts. <br /> <br /> However, he found that the script was historically inaccurate and ridiculous, so he refused, and also asked them to stop using his name as a source (I was embarrassed to think people thought he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows Hitler hitting his dog. There is no single source for this. Hitler loved the animals above the people. He brought in the most stringent animal welfare laws in Europe, where animal anatomy and experimentation were banned. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film turns the iron cross into a farce involving bribery. Absolute lies. I have given it to frequent courageous actions over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents showing that Hitler had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from these pictures, Hitler is portrayed as just a frantic person in this flick. <br /> <br /> If half of him is ignorant, hard and thick as it is in this nonsense film as in real life you will not even know that it ever existed. I do not mind becoming a leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Go and watch the falls and give this very wide pier.
