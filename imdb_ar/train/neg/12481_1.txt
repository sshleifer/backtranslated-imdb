The story of this sword and sorcery of a cruel and horrific "hero" overcomes a wicked and worthless king in almost every detail. Representation is terrible from roles to supporting roles. The gloomy gloom of the heroic, blood-stained director is disgusting; he can not be compensated by any justice for his cause, because it is as bad as the people who fight it. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where the character "die" of a sword blow is lost quite clearly! <br /> <br /> The film clearly draws on the charms of women's shows, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, which are mostly shown naked throughout the film. As a 20-year-old man, I will not claim that the female flesh on the screen does not appeal to me. But the treatment of their characters is very humiliating and the sex scenes are so ordinary and unpleasant that I could not even enjoy this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the cheesecake films in this age are recovered at least somewhat by the sense of the soft tongue (better sequel), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself very seriously as a heroic fantasy. Not possible! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of ****.
