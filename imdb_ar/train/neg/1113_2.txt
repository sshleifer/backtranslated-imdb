Hopalong Cassidy with a white horse that does not bear the name of Topper? Go! <br /> <br /> This Scarecrow caused a great injustice to all cowboy heroes, Hoopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays his role is a young man versus an old man, with blond hair against white, and kills people in exchange for shooting from their hands. Will you stand true Hopalong game please! <br /> <br /> One of the worst films ever made, believe it or not, by the person who brought us the grandfather's epic!
