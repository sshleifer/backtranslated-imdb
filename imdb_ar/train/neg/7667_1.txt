Defining abomination as defined in the Webster lexicon is "a cause of disgust or disgust". If someone can think of a word or definition more appropriate than this for Alone in the Dark, please let us know because this is the best I can reach. However, I do not feel that this word describes anyway the horror of this film. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has tastes very similar to me, the other is the flick / movement tutor. This latter man usually does not care about the size of the plot openings, as long as the film contains a lot of bangs that will walk away. <br /> <br /> This is said to have entered the theater to watch Friday alone in the dark. To our surprise we were the only people in the theater. When I started, I knew the reason immediately. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5-minute scroll text that is listed. However, I understand why he narrated it. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would have the idea of ​​paying to watch this film. However, this scene is not the first is the longest text passed in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems as though we are in the same sequence we hear about separating movies altogether. The first revolves around an ancient civilization and manipulates it with a portal, and the other revolves around a crazy world and its experiences on orphans. If you read this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then start the horror story, acting, effects and camera action. Tara Reid is appalling as an actress. She does not do anything for even a second and makes you think she is a faithful museum. Slater is very bad, unconvincing, and has no chemistry with Reed. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing anyone has ever made. All the time, I ask myself and my roommate for similar tastes such as: What is this? What is happening? Unlike these scroll litter we have a few sequences narrated by Slater himself. Are they good? No. Do they interpret anything? No. Do we ever have the least ink on why we should care about what happens? Again, no. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sexy scene. We were told that Slater and Reed are together, but at no time do they act as if they care about another. But then ... BAM sex scene. Again, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Well, I do not know, 30 seconds after the end of this sad scene, we have a gun battle with 20 military or so and a similar number of strange things. This is set on a track of heavy metal and causes more brain bleeding than previously thought. <br /> <br /> If that is not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no key to the villain. There is a world and there are "strange" things. At some point, the world controls strange things and stands on a hill ordering them to attack the military site. why? How to become the supreme leader of these things? Why are they listening to him? Again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reid Yamshian in a city that has been evacuated. Why was the city evacuated? Did alien things penetrate? Did the army tell them? Who knows ... the point of who cares? I did not and will not. <br /> <br /> But to ignore it, Slater and Reed were attacked by something strange. Although it has been reported that exotic things will be killed because of exposure to sunlight. That's right, I guessed it, it's midday & # $% which is as bright as it could be. Maybe the odd thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know nor care. <br /> <br /> Now that the film is over, I run out of the theater, every 6 feet 6 inches from me, and put my arms out and shake out telling everyone not to go to see this movie. Even my colleague in the motion / adventure room (who was thinking of a film cut and pasted just two hours from the explosion in one film to be the greatest thing ever created) acknowledged that the plot holes were very clear in this film. <br /> To summarize CRAP-FEST, give it 0.0 / 10 and give it less if you can. <br /> <br /> Unambiguously, the worst film he ever made. I do not wish this film my worst enemy.
