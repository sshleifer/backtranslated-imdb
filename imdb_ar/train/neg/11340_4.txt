This is definitely one of the most exotic films ever made - even for Fellini. Just about one more weird is his SATYRICON. This takes two and a half hours in a strange world of nightmares characterized by corruption, luxury and sexual challenge. Sutherland creates an unattractive casanova, and individual events in a series of unrelated short stories taken from the biographer's biography fail to attract the viewer. However, the artistic trend and fashion design are fantastic. I missed the Academy so I did not run but I did justice by rewarding OSCAR for the latter. It was also nominated (oddly enough) in a disjointed, useless and almost uninhabitable scenario. Go and conclude !! The movie on the video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original runtime. This viewer was grateful.
