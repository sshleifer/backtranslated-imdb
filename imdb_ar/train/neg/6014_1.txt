Left behind an incredible waste of more than $ 17 million. The representation is weak and uninspiring, the story is weaker. The public is asked to believe the completely unreasonable line of conspiracy and ridiculous times and not give anything for their good intentions. Not only is the film badly represented and filmed, it lacks all the artistic fields of filmmaking. Production design does nothing to help the credibility of the procedure. The effects are completely authentic and flat. Lighting and overall continuity are not desirable. Even compared to movies with ten budget. However, none of this will be important in the fact that millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film because it is dynamic and religious; it can be blamed. However, it is regrettable that they will have to accept the third film industry.
