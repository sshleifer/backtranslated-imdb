I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix which offers a very good set of items on the last day. Unfortunately, the quality of camera work and editing is about to awe! We have countless facial shots full of Hendrix where he could do almost anything and take Paula? We do not see his hands on the guitar that is the whole point! Also we offer lots of Hendrix clips from the back? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools are all running them. It seems that the man standing in front of Hendrix is ​​keen to wander his focus lazily on the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar just distraction. While the person behind him is more careful to beep at a few chicks in the stalls than to document the actual work of the amazing guitar that bleeds amp (sound recording thanks to Wally Heider) Vietnam and others on tracks like a machine gun, a complete waste of the film! If Hendrix had lived up to two more years, Berkeley was one of those things that were not to see the light of day as far as a full official version goes. The only gems they contain are Johnny PJ's stunning, but all that is in close visual close to the great man and less than both Woodstock and White Island
