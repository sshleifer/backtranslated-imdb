While it contains facts that have not been widely disseminated, they are not exactly the truth. They took many liberties in rearranging events, except for people, and using groups that did not meet the realities of their lives in the 1930s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and WD in the gang at different times, and these people had a great relationship to facts like those. Buck and Blanche went to persuade Clyde to go directly earlier than the one shoot, and actually be returned to the crime. Some of the events filmed in broad daylight actually occurred at night. Bonnie's wound was more severe and never cured. It was so bad that someone had to endure it until it healed, and even then it was tightened until it walked away. Clyde also walked limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe. I know I became picky, it was a television movie, but even without these real mistakes in this TRUE story, the film moves very quickly from one event to another and comes in the form of several separate shots of their lives rather than a coherent story flowing. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
