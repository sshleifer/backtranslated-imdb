To be honest, I did not see all the original "howls", but those scenes I saw made it clear that the first howling was a wonderful film. Very large, that seven terrible sequel had to be made. They began with "Second howl: your sister is a werewolf." I got this movie on my uncle's VHS sometime ago when he was presenting a collection of old films he had bought when Atari was new. I just saw her last night, and it was not really bad, it was very strange. I mean, the whole thing with Sibyl Daning in a triangular direction with two of her bereaved followers was misplaced and very annoying (but somewhat heated), Christopher Lee is about to stab Karen as dead as if she were a vampire, etc. In fact, this movie was somewhat like a musical mash for Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with wolves, because everything was Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) talking about the famous wolves of every other vampire movie (Share the heart, garlic, the night creature must die at night, the wolves governor lives in Transylvania). Not much for acting, but the worst of it came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the film, I found myself wandering around wolves to break her throat, because that throat was always saying something. Anyway, the plot is silly and cliched, so there's no real point to tell you, you can read about it in Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that makes me feel really sick about this film is the fact that it is the only film among all seven sequences that relate in any way to the original origin (not Howling IV (1988), which was a new version of the original, , The sequel based on the same novel). So do not see this movie. There is no real horror, hardly any wolves, and only your terrible Forex. 10/03
