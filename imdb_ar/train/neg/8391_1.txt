Well ... now that you know where Rob Zombie has stolen the title of "House of a Thousand Bodies," I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the hypnotic presentations or vulgar scenario would raise the dead in the "House of the Seven Bodies", but Goli comes from his fabulous plot (ha!) Anyway, to kill amateur Damien who make a low-rent scare in his former home! In Hell House (sorry, I do not remember the actual name of the stay), a series of mysterious and unexplained deaths have occurred for a long time. Some, such as John Carradin's Arthritic Lurch (whose small role provides only worthwhile moments in the film) To the Ripper; the next film director John Ireland rejects it as fairy tales. The result is like "The Devil's School for Girls" (an engaging title, the values ​​of television-designed production, an intriguing plot) crossed with "children should not play with dead objects" (low-rent film about low-rent filmmakers who woke up dead) Any place near entertainment or fun. "The house of the seven bodies" died in the first frame, and the rest of the 89 minutes passes through the mortar, dragging us along every painful second ...
