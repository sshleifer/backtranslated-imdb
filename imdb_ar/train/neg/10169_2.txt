It's 1978, obviously there are a lot of black players in the teams! The fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, and the only happier thing is that there are so many black players on the pitch! This make for Super Bowl TV movie is convertible. It was not much more, but it is really amazing to cast the talented actors who are showing (at present), and perhaps most notably Tom Seelik. Unfortunately, anything Selleck brings to the screen is quickly overcome by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story about supernatural betting. PJ Jackson charges "PJ Jackson" to ensure the game ends in its favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough and seems to have a loose understanding by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, Lenny Unexpected, takes charge. For a while, the murder mystery is not known for sure, but it was clearly revealed in the recent murder that Lenny is a new opponent. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's watchable. Representation is decent, photography is fine. At least, there were no typical silly classic car chases (they have their place here not just here). Just keep an open mind about the stereotypes and cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
