This film revolves around a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) trying to pick up a very intelligent thief (Ekin Cheng), who extricates insurance company headed by Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever plans the policeman tries to know in one way or another in advance. This film, covered by handsome leading actors, a beautiful lead actress and good camera footage from Hong Kong scenes, has no content at all. Everything flash, and soon the flash becomes dim too. I have lost all of my interest in a third of the way to the film, and then there is no high quality, except for cinematography that looks good. Just think about watching this movie if you can do it for free. Also, consider turning off watching the movie within 20 minutes of the film because it is still in the end: BORING. 10/06
