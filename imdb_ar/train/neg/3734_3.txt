A confusing mess is really incomprehensible. Most of the things in the film look like 1987, but there are things to come just like Ray's gun. And this car! The director seems to love colorful lights. The outstanding performance was really the girl who played the role of Valerie, but due to the lack of a cast list, I do not know the actress that she was. This one deserves lost. Grade: F
