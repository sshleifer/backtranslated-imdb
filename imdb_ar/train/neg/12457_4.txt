It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some are very exciting (and I say very weak), some are an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both have been experimented with psychological excitement, but in this case, the film can not connect things together, because of poor scripting, superficiality, bad representation, and dark, boring cinematography. I would say that Salvatores did his best in other species and elsewhere, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, film B, barely worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
