This film is really despicable. Plays on urban paranoia in the 1970s and 1980s and places it in the school context. I'm not saying that urban crime has not been a problem for many people or that schools have not been / are not problem areas but this vile exploitation takes biscuits. Violence is inconceivable in anything realistic, but in this case, it is not a social issue, but a middle-class student uses it to turn itself into a crime defender at the local high school. Of course he knows how to play the system. Is this sound familiar. Yes really. This faeces is purely violent exploitation, really bad piece of work. It is an annoying brutality worn as a social commentary. This belongs to the same class of garbage as pesticide, Death Wish 2-5, and so on. The only noticeable thing is that Michael Fox has been broken at the time when he had to do things like this.
