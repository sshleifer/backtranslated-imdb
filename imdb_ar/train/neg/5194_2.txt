Do not get me wrong, I want to see marijuana certified like the next man. I must digress now. But writing was unrealistic. My mother deals with drugs, but she insists that her drugs be put into the hands of someone under the legal age. Give me a break. The oddity of the beautiful figure of Mary Louise Parker was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not likable at all. Basically, the land lines did not go anywhere. I understand her only television ground. The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be either fantastic and is supposed to believe it .... Why ???? I felt I was preaching through a show of my life. It's like saying "OK" to cheat on your wife, but with someone who's legal age. Well, not exactly the same, but I think you get my point. I think saving children's belongings is great for campaign trails, but it does not keep water in the cable sitcom from a suburban mother, as a local bettor.
