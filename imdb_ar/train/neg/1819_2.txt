You searched for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors ever - there with Ed Wood Jr, Ray Denis Steckler and Pantheon of Horrible. Still, I was a disappointed child because, although the film was really bad, it never came close to the horrific levels of some of his previous disturbing films. For this reason, this film was not particularly enjoyable to watch our bad films. <br /> <br /> I was now cautious about watching this movie, because the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie look like a movie porn movie - something I will not review on IMDb. However, this film sometimes appeared - especially the first 10 minutes. However, you can say that the script went through many changes, since in most of the film there was no tickle at all, and at the end of the film there is a plot that does not come from where there is no violence and certainly not exciting. ! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the parts is good. For example, as a pornographic video, it shows surprisingly little and it is incomprehensible why a 71-year-old man was placed in some scenes of love. Mr. Livingston, 71, seemed to be very good - but he was still an old man and no one wanted to see him with young Nymphate! Then, when the last 20 minutes becomes very violent, Livingstone became a young man like Rambo! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, there is little that can be recommended for this sad movie. It's not bad enough or interesting enough, and the film can be quite boring even with such a crazy title as "naughty hostess".
