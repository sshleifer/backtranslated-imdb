I can fondly remember Bo Bo Derek's interest in journalism in the UK (Sun & News of the World World) - all after her small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, there was a lot of fuss about her light face, her blue eyes crystal clear and her breasts completely refreshed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the representation has never been! I think they should make one of the three-disc sets that you always find in DVD-deal boxes, Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All of these films can be nominated for "Too Bad, It's Great". <br /> <br /> It will be guilty of "I have to buy!" If you read your press, or this comment to Ms. Derek, please do not be insulted - you always have a comfortable place for you and there are more important things going on in the world worrying about your ability to act. a lot of love
