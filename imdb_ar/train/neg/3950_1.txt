I did not realize before that in the early 1990s, Devry University (or ITT Tech) added a film to an impressive array of degree programs. Well, this movie must be a product of the class widget. My friend and I rented the original Boogeyman for 1980 on my Netflix and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Awful awful awful. <br /> <br /> The director adds two main characters, a woman and her therapist. Women had dreams about Boogeyman and his sacrifice from the first film. More than 50% of this movie is the stock of the original film. The rest of the film is the main character that has bad dreams while the wizard has its drones on the narrator. These scenes are captured through a filter so that dense characters glow. They will make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, to sum up, awful. You do not see this movie.
