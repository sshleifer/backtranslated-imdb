Michael Keaton was never a good actor; in Tim Burton's Batman films, he always falls into the shadows of great bad guys. Here, he starred as a widowed husband picking radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to connect to life ... <br /> <br /> Well, this film is supposed to be shocking, it really makes a mistake in every spot there is a shock to you. Because there are so many things that end up unexplained, unexplored and uninteresting. So, where is the awful excitement when every movie gets so bad in the first place that white noise makes it fool on its own? This film is really bad and its acting, something that can not be seen. Michael Keaton tries to return to the world of excitement but ends up losing the goal more than ever before.
