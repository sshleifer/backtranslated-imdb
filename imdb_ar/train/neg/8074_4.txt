Like a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors have a heart in the right place, but executed with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / directing effort is freely borrowed from other better films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not abandon the assumption; it is enough to say that they are not treated well here in these two great films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie, about to go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and her ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Anabel (Eliza Dushko) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers (?) In transparent masks. She survives the wreckage, but while in university she has visions of the ordeal in the hospital and the dead people appear and disappear, leaving her in a state of complete confusion: who died? Who is alive? What is real? <br /> <br /> A look at "Soul Survivors" has a bad view of the exploitation of blood-soaked teenagers, bloodshot, and bloodied corpses. It is true that it has its share of deadly victim scenes (abundant, repetitive and astounding to the mind), but at least tries to build suspense through ideas rather than clich√©s, unfortunately, to no avail. It is often confusing, more cohesive, where the story becomes mixed, chaotic and incoherent near the main points of mystery (predictable as it is). <br /> <br /> Horror fans who capture a copy will have no idea that they They are interested in a movie that is more interested in building an uncomfortable facade of reality rather than offering a personal census. Thanks to Carpenter for trying to create something that goes beyond the flick of a teenage horror; too bad I've created a psychic derivative. Sagemler also deserves fame to show power in central performance, to actually develop her character and to evoke some sense of emotion as a disjointed coupe. It's great for filmmakers to try something different, but the film ends with a mixed bag and a failed experience. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
