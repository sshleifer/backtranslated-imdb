Marilyn Brando's watch on the screen is like watching a main carpenter poke intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando is the only thing that makes this film changeable. The plot is crazy and funny (not comic). It seems that other big-name actors are making desperate attempts to give the characters a little imagined of humanity ... These characters have a humanity of wet cardboard. All about the technical aspect of this film is either modest or just awful. The director casts shots of the freezing frame and slow motion with impunity. Occasional music is a caricature and destroys any hint of great impact. It's not something I'm really looking for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was on its way. The distinguished Brando could not take the focus away from the terrible breach that made him decorate her. I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "Incredibly funny" ... it is not. David Lynch's films are about evil creativity - this film was by no means creative. Do not confuse stupidity with stupidity.
