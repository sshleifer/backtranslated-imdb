I was attracted to this film, and I am intrigued to learn how to adapt to the brutal novel Shelter Hubert Shelby. I thought that a literary piece of this depth, with a rich texture of characters, horrible attitudes, and social criticism can not be translated into a bad film. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This click is a terrible movie experience, not because of its content, but because of its shape. Director Ulrich Edel performs, in my honest opinion, a terrible directing mission that does not do justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director. This movie looks and feels like a flick "Made for TV" bad. Some of my views on this bomb (** spoilers before **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of directional inspiration. The viewer is slow, feels slow, looks bad, and barely moves from a steady location. The only freedom they take in the cinema area, in a nice dark tone. Otherwise, the film has the same artistic creativity as the television series. <br /> <br /> - All actors do a wonderful job of portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that adaptation does not address a key element in developing the plot: motivation. All these characters move like robots without a clear motive for their work. They seem to be doing things of blue, like robots, for no reason at all. Edel miss every opportunity to enrich personal development by not exploring personal motives, avoiding the development of every character's personality to the limit. <br /> <br /> This lack of personal development is blatant on the Tralala. Jennifer Gason Light does a great job of playing prostitution, but its decision to allow the sailors to violate it has not been explained. It seems very stupid, as we see this character doing this of blue. This is a clear example of the development of weak personality. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains many symbolic secondary characters who do nothing, feel nothing, and add nothing to the plot. I wanted to learn more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Idel approaches the development of character with Harry and installs it with his gay lover, only to decipher it in the end, not to explain his motives clearly. Thugs are also a joke in their lack of sophistication. <br /> <br /> - Sound is one of the worst experiences I have ever experienced. Terrible work by Mark Nobble. I was expecting more seriously than the former leader of the Derry Strait, but his job in this film does not exist at all. Sometimes, as in the battle between union workers and police, the music looks completely separate from the film. He also feels completely poor and engraved. The whole sound can be sworn by using a Casio game keyboard. It distracts attention from actual action. <br /> <br /> Desmond Nacano's adaptation of the book is so literal that it removes the point of the story. It seems as though they have tried hard to keep the narrative of the work as it is in the book, so much so that they have already forgotten the development of characters and, once again, explain their actions and motives. <br /> <br /> I'm serious I can not recommend this movie, nor even to Shelby's fans, because it can spoil the original book. It is a very unhelpful effort to adapt the novel, showing very little creative input.
