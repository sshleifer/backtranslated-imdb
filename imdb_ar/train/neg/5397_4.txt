I think this is one of the weakest acts of Kenneth Prana Shakespeare. After great efforts such as Ado About Nothing, etc. I think this was bad. The actors were weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Neville, McClone ???) but my greatest thing is that they messed up cool works and cut off some of the play to put in musical / dance strings. <br /> <br /> You just do not do Shakespeare then mess with the play. Sorry, but that's a mistake. I like some cool porter just like the next person, but jeez, do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and see Prospero Books if you want to see Shakespeare's wonderful adaptation of the storm.
