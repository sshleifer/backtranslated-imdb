Jean Roland is a technical nonsense about vampires and aliens and the pursuit of eternity. <br /> <br /> Beautiful women and stunning photography. The dialog is invalid. It's a funny mess. Great to look at but like any appearance of horror film or purely horror film. I'm trying to figure out whether we're supposed to be scared or not. At the same time is put or not? It's a strange mix of horror and horror film that never fits in with the fact that it's nice to look at it as not saying "mean" anything, and it's scary in any way even if the snapshot or the crossword sequence creates a moment of conclusive friction. Something to leave in the background and living wallpaper for those who love naked women.
