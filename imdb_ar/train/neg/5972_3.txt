What a disappointment! Piper adorable Pirappo, Tyra Banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actress and misses the talented and beautiful Maria Bello! Bello must be awkward from some lines! The plot, scenario and introduction are a joke! <br /> <br /> I'm not against silly films, I think something about Mary is a masterpiece, but Coyote Ugly is a waste of 90 minutes .....
