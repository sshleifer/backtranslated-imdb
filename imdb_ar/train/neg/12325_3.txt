I remember this offer. I still remember that kick ass fun song "the most extreme people in America". Frankly it should have been called lame Americans or people disgusting or disgusting. Dave could not save this offer, nor did Bob Sageet or the alternate hosts of the AFV program. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and Dave yes could make some good sound amounts that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the terrible videos made by people. It also evolved somewhat with a variety with lame guest stars including Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in the foreground before they started to choose ugly drooling as sinful children like the winner. Did you mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still rock theme song!
