This film is very boring. There are scraps of naked meat thrown in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but not working. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a good job dealing with her personally, but Day-Lewis captures most of her lines. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Kaufmann had no idea how to portray this. The contradictions in the recoil between family issues / domestic marriages and political crises are poorly matched. Personal attitudes change without clarification all the time. Badly disassembled.
