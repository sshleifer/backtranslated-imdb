Comedian steel entertainment, with musical breaks, generates fast pace-bearing actions in tandem at the pace of enthusiasm through a maze of humorous complications and radiator. Boris Karloff, Bella Lugosi and Peter Laurie form a powerful group of evil villain. The script contains all the slippery billboards of the mysterious film, secret passages, thunder, lightning, and poisonous arrows. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre share their heavy creations and clear melodramas of the gas-lit era. Kai Kiser and his band provided a wonderful entertainment for people living in the 1940s who were trying to forget the horrors of World War II.
