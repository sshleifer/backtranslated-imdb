I have never had a movie to write a review, but it was exhausting. I stumbled in an attempt to find what was around this film that made Snoop choose him as his first serious role but frankly it was a bad choice. I made a good book, but it certainly was not useful to me as a film. I found it unbelievable, lacked atmosphere, and found that many scenes were frighteningly simplistic. The music maestro is probably just a serious actor who is delving into the film. By Dylan McDermott and Rose Berne was acceptable but not enough to carry out a weak conspiracy with a weak dialogue. I may have lost this point completely, but for me did not match any kind, did not raise any sympathy with the characters did not create any suspense, and in fact found myself praying for the end and deeply suppressed desire to slap all three main characters!
