This film was initially confusing. I usually liked Gina Phillips, but this movie I have to say was a bad choice just like Ring Around the Rosie does. It does not make good films. Giggers Kripers was the best. Anyway, the Donawi Fei was good. It drove me crazy and in the end, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cacy (Phillips) who comes to the funeral of her twin sisters. She stays in a house owned by her sister and her grandmother (Donaway) lives with a aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Donaway) sacrificed her relationships to survive and as long as she wanted to live, she could not die. Even if Jennifer tried to kill her, she was trying. Crows have a strange part in it. When relationships go to sleep, the ravens eat members there, so they can not sleep. But they do. Basically, all this madness and Mary Ellen will never die, her relationships will be buried, but she will not die, where she must suffer forever so that Mary Ellen can survive. Yes, I hope this helps. If that does not happen, sorry. I love you.
