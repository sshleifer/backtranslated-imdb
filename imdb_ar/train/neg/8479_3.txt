Well, when I participated in this film, I was really expecting people to make fun of it. I was surprised to see people over 7 who loved him. I enjoyed the film ... but only I and my little sister (which is really only 10) could sneer at everything. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan, but this representation was Sii. You know that a movie is going to the toilet when the film can not work. It did not have a good text or a plot to recover it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very lame ... pathetic at the border. <br /> <br /> Even with what was said, I thought there were a few good actors, such as Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, not enough to retrieve the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie I can not overcome: 1. Spencer's man will drop her. Well, cocky. I searched for the dates, while in fact, was only about four years older, and the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much larger. Jordan very beautiful girl, but in the GF, looked like 10 or 12 ... looked like a little girl! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is no way that Kristi Yamaguchi will come just to ski one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it seems unlikely that Christie would go to an boarding school that did not even have ski scholarships, or that a school would have used a ski instructor with such connections. <br /> <br /> That's all that is said ... It was not the worst known movie at all, but it was not even good by DCOM standards, which I consider very low.
