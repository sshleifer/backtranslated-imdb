To overcome his wife's death, an elderly man does what a normal person does (at least in Peter Greenway's film): he and his son fill their house with eight-and-a-half (one with no legs) and initiate sexual odyssey. Since this movie is Greenaway, there is a lot of pretentious and uninteresting pretense, and of course there is an unnecessary nudity for males. In fact, the father and son share a sleeping bed in the bare. Total. Besides, who wants to see the full old man in front of me? For those who are not in the sex scene, one of the women likes to do bad with the horses. There is no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
