I think I've seen all the Grisham movies now and in general are all very poor, except The Rainmaker, but this movie is very bad it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> SPOILERISH WARNING <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that Where the person with the stupid things that stupid did not do anyone. He is a lawyer for Christ. Why when his children disappear does not call the police. Oh yes, because all the policemen hate the lawyers, so they ignore him and allow him to attack. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, they allow him to be released, and he will be held in a cell waiting for bail. <br /> <br /> Why drag your children halfway around the country where you can easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> The police do not bother trying to find a mental patient who has escaped, they do not bother to meet his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous ending ??. <br /> <br /> In short, silly, too unrealistic, and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever.
