Spoilers from all over the world !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "The First to Die" and wanted to find out if the film follows the book, so I saw it. For the most part I did. There were some minor differences (the site was another violent scene for example) but not much, and most often the film remained true to the book more then then most of the films. <br /> <br /> This may be a mistake - although the film was perfect with Pollen and Bellows especially - I was not impressed by this book. Or let me get it back. I started to be very impressed, gradually becoming more disappointed and by the end I became quite dissatisfied and felt almost relieved. No difference with the film. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "bonus" in the book, or in the film. I rarely read a film he did, and I created this waiver with final precision, and I hoped the film would change a bit. <br /> <br /> Everyone - (I did it, did not do it), they both did not) - they were not interesting, not fantastic and more confusing, annoying and depressing then nothing else. In addition, the love of Lindsay's life has died in the end (after her illness gets out of tears as she cries at his grave). Then she disappears to where she thinks of suicide .... Then suddenly she is in a fight for her life with the real villain who has been He was cleared after his arrest .. But it turned out that he and the wife were together .... Hello !!! This is all now a "public hospital" rather than an old-fashioned excitement. I felt cheated and disturbed by watching the book and watching the film (I must admit that it caught my attention well - it was a good representation for a television film) he hoped not to follow the book that ended. <br /> <br /> I still think the film is watchable and for some reason it does not leave a bad taste in your mouth like the book (or maybe I knew what would happen) but I must say the way the story did not complete well at all.
