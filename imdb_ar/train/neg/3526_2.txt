(Spoiler is included, some may say) <br /> <br /> This movie is not possible to take seriously. In some parts it is so stupid that I can only laugh at everything. Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with full climbing equipment or (which is really a favorite) and grabs a bad man by sticking to him in a stuffed animal. Yes, what is the evil force he has mobilized to accomplish such exploits? I do not know that, but it certainly gives reality for money.
