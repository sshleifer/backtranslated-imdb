This movie is all flash and not soul. The actors expressed a great passion for numbers, but these figures often did not relate to the film and felt like stand-alone music videos. He made no effort to make the numbers sound as if they were happening in front of you. Everyone seemed to come from a studio, absorbing all of life from the songs. The performances were all bland and unrealistic, especially Hudson, who plays mainly the same "angry" black woman (stubborn and selfish) that we have seen before. There was no depth to her character or any of the other female threads. Although I think the film wants us to believe that the Hudson character is having difficulties because of its weight, only its refusal is to do better for the team that lands on it, making the end of the film meaningless. Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, passion was released (although it was often misplaced, but this was a writer / director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to illustrate the already written character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only character with a bow, he has done a good job, but he is not worth an Oscar. The only actor who brought something to the list was Danny Glover, who took a small figure that was relatively unimportant and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth in, no drama or heart, or even laugh. The music numbers were so bad that at times the film seemed to make fun of the musical rather than being a play; the figure when Hudson argues with the other girls is too long if he has gone much longer to pass the play of the family guy. The film has no idea what's going on around it, and I've been offended in the last few minutes. It's a great waste of time and it's really the worst movie I saw in 2006, and there was nothing great last year.
