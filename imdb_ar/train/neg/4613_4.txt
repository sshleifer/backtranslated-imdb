OK, what is it ?! I found Nicholson's character shallow and, most importantly, unfortunately. The character of Angelica Houston drained my strength. Kathleen Turner is a dirty no good slut. It's not that I do not understand. It's not that I do not think some ideas might lead to something more. It's a film that has only the idea that we are supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the film is about. Nicholson's fall in Turner is ridiculous, but again, it's supposed to be. But this does not hit me as a funny (or b) ... even interesting distance !!! This was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype get your best ... It's a waste of your time! With all that being said, the opening church sequence is very beautiful ...
