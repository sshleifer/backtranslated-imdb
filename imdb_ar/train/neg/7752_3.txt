The film revolves around the game "sabretooth" that you lose in a recreation park where teenagers are on a fishing trip. Because there are no rules to break into a building and start killing. Deaths are cheese and stupid. But at least it had better effects then sabretooth. I gave him three because Stacy was in it and I loved Sabretooth. I thought it was fine but some of the deaths were off the screen. There was a stupid scene where the teenagers lay and the head of the sabretooth came out and the boy took his girlfriend behind him and left her to make her look completely red. Then the sabretooth wakes up in the ventilation holes and bites the children. The final death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics. So that this death was stupid because the age of statues passed through his mouth and hung there as if he will support and there is a scene when the girl loses contact with the Gothic and can not find it in need. The movie is stupid and time consuming.
