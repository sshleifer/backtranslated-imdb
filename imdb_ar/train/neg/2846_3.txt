What an awesome movie this is. The only reason you want to sit in this mess is the sight of Miss Ellenack. Mr. McNamara's overestimating, sometimes embarrassing, destroyed what would have been a reasonable film if the right actors were represented. Mr. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor who clearly wants to be.
