As a single woman over the age of 40, this film was found to be very humiliating and humiliating for single women over the age of 40, let alone every other woman, at any age. It was a sad and pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct the "flick" and failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not initially represented, but given the non-existent "plot" (hate to refer to it as a plot) in this, she did not have a chance. There has been no evolution in character, no reason to feel empathy / empathy with any characters, and no attempt to make the film in any realistic or reasonable way. Then there is a mandatory male imagination of a straight attractive woman suddenly decides to experience lesbianism - please. <br /> <br /> Not only wish I could recover my money to rent a DVD, but also want those 112 minutes of my life again. What a steal.
