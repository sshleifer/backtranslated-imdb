I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I loved). 4 different life / stories meet in the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn in the middle of the movie and was lost. I almost closed it at the time and there, but I felt I had to hang it there until the end, and I did not know it would be another hour of mantra for an hour and a half. Thank God I hired instead of seeing it in the theater. I screamed almost in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the last frog scene. My DVD player still did not forgive me and I do not blame him one. It was a unique film, but it was a bad, boring and meaningless film.
