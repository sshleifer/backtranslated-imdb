I have never heard of Larry Vesendeen before, but judging by this effort in writing and directing, he must maintain his daily function as a Tommy actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to classify this film, it was not scary or frightening, so it can not be described as horror. It was too thin and it could not be a drama, and there was no suspense so it was not a bad film. You should only see if you are a fan of the Blair Witch Project. People who loved this film used words, such as "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read something that did not exist. Like Blair's witch, people felt scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought some dirty stuff because it was terrifying. This film actually started well with the family "meet" locals after the deer hit. It seemed like a salvation in modern times, but after 45 minutes, (more than half the film), nothing happened, the family was chasing around their holiday home which was all very nice and wonderful but nothing less entertaining. It was clear that the locals would participate in some way at some point but it is clear that Essendon had no idea how to build suspense in the film. Finally, when something happens, it is not clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said that his liver is grazing only), and throughout this time it is clear that the spirit of the Vedium follows the shooter in a very clumsy manner with special effects grade 3 The film is called Wendigo, but no attempt was made to explain it in any clear way. The film ends in confusion and leaves you completely dissatisfied. I had saved 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could recover itself. he did not do.
