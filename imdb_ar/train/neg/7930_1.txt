This piece of nonsense may have been appreciated 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a real racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart released actor Halle Williams from The Jimmy Stewart Show, just because Williams was black. As if this was not bad enough, this film is dated and very boring. See "Dances with Wolves" instead for a less racist view. <br /> <br /> Stuart was in his forties when this horrible film was made, and even with a ridiculous wig he still seemed to be chasing the kids after 16 years. Old Debra Paget. I was surprised that it was allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
