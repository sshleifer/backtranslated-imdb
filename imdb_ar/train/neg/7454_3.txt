I love the actors very much but the story unfolds slowly. Danny Glover does a good job of making you wonder if the bad guy is. At the same time, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quid did not have as much space in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit more depressing than how the story unfolded. I was watching it again though. It has a value of 5 (I hope to set it at 5.5)
