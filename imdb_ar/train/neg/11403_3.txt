I love horror movies, low budget, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties .. But how can anyone think this is a good horror film? Let's compare it with the titles in the films of a similar homely home. Haunting, change, shining. Or a horror film based on similar technique was FAAAR better, (although it is still a great FAR) Demon Seed. Well, I'll be fair .. Let's compare it to horror movies specially designed for television! Do not go to sleep .. waaay creepy and better done. It was a lot of Salem, the night chaser, and the night show, so do not go to the basement or a much better crowded farmhouse. * Spoilers * First of all, because a good scene like a bloody bathing scene, you have a scene like the opening scene .. Hey boy! Garden hose comes alive for some playful teens' hose! terrible. Also, what we understand about the house .. Obviously he needs to use his camcorders to see what is happening, a very passionate house. It is not a soul, a devil, or an entity. It is a "owned" house, but what? It led us to believe that an unfamiliar being would learn to love Susie / Margaret, our hero? Now that you are on the subject of suzie .. Another scene completely annoyed me, this poor mad lady, tells you that she was your nurse, flowing from her heart, located in the boiling basin, struggling in suffering for 45 seconds and what do you do Margherita? Do you risk burning her hands to save this poor elderly woman who came to warn her of death? No, she stands there and watches! For the most part, acting was better than the average horror film, but that's where the pros end. The horror film is more interesting and fun at least about a non-lethal object that kills people watching the bed of death: the bed that eats. I have a feeling that the people who have rated this very high have either not seen it since its original release, or remember it as frightening as children. This film was much less merit.
