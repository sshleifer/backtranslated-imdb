This is just one of those hideous films you find on Lifetime TV that depicts the repugnant behavior of some sympathetic women in a sympathetic way. Along with other bad films like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why not be such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the film directors: If Lou Tourno were a man, and Philie was a 12-year-old girl, would you have given me a liking and sympathy for that person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine the gender switch in this movie, and then you'll just see why I and others here consider this piece of waste worthless. If the sexes are switched, there will be no attempt to sympathize with the offender. Instead, we are likely to deal with the image of a wild and ugly man feeding on a young girl, his corrupt behavior landing in prison, and a brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau did not get the same treatment in this film is because of her sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call things by their real names. LeTourneau is a homosexual. Clear and simple. No exceptions, uses, or reservations. She is a criminal who belongs to prison and deserves our ridicule and contempt, but it is certainly not pity or sympathy.
