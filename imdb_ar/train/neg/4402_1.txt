I usually liked lesbian movies even if they were not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this one is just digging. Yes, the beautiful scenery and beautiful buildings, there is a short but exciting dramatic period, but this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between tampering and getting a high degree of stoning / betting on any useful drug or wine, and Ayala deals with this absurdly insensitive behavior through the entire film. At no time did we give any idea why, or even why Annamarie was so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there is a kind of closure at least in (probably it's romantic? 'so you know!) The relationship between the two, there may be some kind of satisfaction. But Annamarie asks Ella, "Why do you love me?" Ella does not admit that. It is never clear whether this is anything more than a lesbian (not bad) journey in a boring with a straight woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the locals they met on the journey, which could have been vivid and informative, are rather flat, boring and often incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is a good joke in the film, although I'm sure it was unintended. Women travel in a two-seat Ford Coupe and a medium-sized trunk. However, when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, baby beds, sleeping equipment and even a table, chair and typewriter! Furthermore, when they are traveling in a ferry, we see piles of luggage, potentially theirs, presumably also carrying in the little Ford box! <br /> <br /> Through the entire movie, we have never seen a single gas station, or anywhere that seems to have any place to buy gasoline. Most of them travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get the fuel? <br /> <br /> There may not be a lot of lesbian movies, be it good or bad, but there are plenty of them better than that, and a few of them are worse. Leave this in the rack.
