I love zombie movies and I love amateur productions. The Meat Market 2 begins with a truly promising tribute to the classic Philly "zombie". <br /> <br /> So I turned back and waited for my admiration. Well, some make-up is great for a budget-free film and some actors (vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but there's nothing else. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero movie here but there is no single sequence in the entire movie which contains suspense or shock value. Sure, the director knows how to regulate body ripples and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bears - for me this is not enough - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** From *****
