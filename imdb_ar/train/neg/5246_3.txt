Wow, the most horrifying thing in this episode was the price of homes 40 years ago. I will say that I am not a fan of the episodes that he narrated. If the story / actors / etc. They deserve their salt, they should be able to move the bulk of the narration without having to read it, remind me of characters that can not think of the cuff but rely on the plugs. The mental mind was boring and tedious, but some enjoy this kind of thing, it's not just a cup of tea. They could have kept the narrative, but at least made it more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist, a reporter, or something. Small things like the presence of Peugeot in the house, which has a single half-circle corridor, grumble, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree where he was standing, because he can not be seen on the road or on the property. Edit Checkered, as she is walking down the aisle (apparently for the 100th time) exactly who are these guys you see in the 24m30s walking toward the car as she walks into the abandoned house corridor? The close-up of US dollars was also exaggerated, as a high-school drama student discovered the zoom function on his camera for the first time. I could have continued to secede, but it could be almost as boring as this episode. It has continued to slow down and it seems the real purpose is to use all the shots they have photographed for Ellen driving the convertible Newport. I was quite expecting to see the Chrysler logo and a pretty jingle play while telling us everything about the 8 track engine, automatic top and so on. The only good thing I should say about his character is that he just ends up, all of a sudden. There are no loose ends bound, there is nothing clearer. This is not what many would notice, and I suspect that most of them have already changed the channel or fallen in the end.
