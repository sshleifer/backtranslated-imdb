Before I comment on this film I just saw on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason for my recording is to re-watch what I first saw in television commercials in 1980: Barbara Bach split. Since the film got an R rating, I was expecting to see it naked. Unfortunately, we did not respond to her or to the other outstanding actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager but was 20 years old when she did.
