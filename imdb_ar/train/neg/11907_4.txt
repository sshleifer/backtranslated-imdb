I understood that Dahl's character is a miniature of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock, only to know that in the end it was his own actions that led him to that besieged state and in fact if he practiced good faith for all men everything would be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry, I've made amazing movies in the past that are still neutral in politics and for good reason. Debates are your weak point and this wonderful film, beautifully filmed with silly characters, dialogue and conspiracy, is weakened. Good luck on your next flick. The other thing that took Krani was the favorite point in the homeless section of Los Angeles where he was there for hunger reasons, these people do not get enough food. These people really do not eat regularly but the real hunger for these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger and mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, and dignity that you can not give to a man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need it it is available. Less hunger center in America, I would say that it is more center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger, although a noble endeavor serves the problem of community displacement and more systematic and deepening human aging. Bill Dehel was good, and Michelle Williams was as nice as the old (vulgar) soul.
