One wonders why anyone tries to rephrase the successful film schemes that have already been seen, as is the case with this film. "Wedding History" is one of the best examples of why you do not even try to reshape it, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been abandoned. If a project like this goes ahead with the approval of the big studio honchos, then go with the big stars and the production values ​​shiny, this way, people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not what happens in this misleading attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screenwriters have planted the story into London, while this American attitude seems to be typical, so that the setup can not be fixed. Then there is a problem with the stars. Debra Ming and Dermot Mulroney? They have a lot of chemistry like oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since there was no conflict between Kat and Nick from the start, the viewer was not drawn to the film in the way the creators thought they would be. It is clear that Kat will fall on Nick, and vice versa in this expected story. Amie Adams, who was the best in "Junebug", came across as a shallow girl willing to keep her lie going and not clean for the man he loved and would marry. <br /> <br /> For everyone who is interested, credits at the end of the movie work for about seven minutes!
