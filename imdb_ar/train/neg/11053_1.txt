This is one of "Too bad, it's good" movies that you hear about but you never see! Unlike Troma's bad and deliberate films (and I'm not amusing), this movie is 100% dangerous. <br /> <br /> However, with features like a killer robot assumed to be too deadly and speaks of him like solid gold dancers on an acid trip and his first magical mate who calls lightning and turns into a "good witch in the East" the fact that he takes seriously pays Its so far on a bad edge making it a complete circle around to go amusing. <br /> <br /> Can be seen enough because of this.
