I was very pleased to find this film in the local video library - Carrie Grant in a service-oriented comedy, director Stanley Donin, so far what I do not like? It is the kind of film that made me wonder about two things - when did all the participants (including some known names) realize that they had Turkey on their hands, and what was the worst thing about it among a number of competing sides? I still think of the first, but my vote on the latter goes to the story of the slant, before the sometimes mysterious text, the uncertain tone, the lack of a well-developed and well-defined characterization, and the lack of relationship between characters. You have to add a very unequal attitude to criticism, but it is understood that the actors were struggling with these things and, in addition, they did not seem to have been tested. Often they can barely get the lines out fast enough. Carrie Grant tries to portray his usual charming character and usual personality but sometimes seems unstable and fast in his state. I have to say I was relieved when his venerable vulgar characters Jane Mansfield suggested the emergence of Susie Parker, when she felt comfortable when she suggested his initial character. What do you like about the film? - For me primarily a beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and dignity resembling Grace Kelly. In general, the film is nice to look at. Navy characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you should really marvel at the horrible black Manchu Fu clothes you do not wear in the luxurious hotel suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in his own. Going back to the credit side, Ray Walston is a praiseworthy work for me and I have had an interest in hearing the Werner Klemperer heroes speaking with a supposed German accent!
