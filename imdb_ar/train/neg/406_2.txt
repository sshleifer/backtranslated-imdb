The subject of this film has always been about the wonderful graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They had to continue to disappear the script, then the silly group, and finally every visible element of this film.

I think they bought this script in "Scripts-R-Us", where you can buy a blank "Monster Movie" script and fill in the blanks. There is a monster chasing us. Let us divide. (They actually "let's split" in this film). Hit Alien / Giant Bug / Monster / Invisible Man with the Clone. Not yet dead. Burning huge rabbit / shark / invisible man in the fire is unforgivable. Not yet dead. You know, standard things. Even minimal elements that were special to an invisible film (infrared glasses, spraying using something like paint) were handled badly. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there are plenty of possibilities for this film to be great. These are psychological issues of the subject, the deterioration of the mind because of the process, the treatment of an invisible subject, and many other ideas have been addressed for less than two seconds and would have been more interesting. If there was any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, the film would have been much better. All in all, it is difficult. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some incredibly dumb elements at the end of the film, but I do not want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are very stupid and do not think of pulling the plug on a device instead of ...
