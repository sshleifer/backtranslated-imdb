I did not say that night the hurricanes were awful, but they were far from being great. Average at best. It seems that every time one type of film is released, the second must be around the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante Pick). "Night Hurricanes" is nothing but a cyclone except for the worst and with earthly special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if it was not brilliant, the film itself, the output, the special effects, the whole story was very strange to the interpretation. A series of hurricanes hit a city, and the film revolves mainly around people trying to find family and friends and deal with damage. <br /> <br /> I do not really know why duplicates of disaster movies were released almost simultaneously, but that was better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
