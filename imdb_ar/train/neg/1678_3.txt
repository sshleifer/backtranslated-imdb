I want to create a game "Holmes with Doors" but I can not link them all. WONDERLAND gives a good laugh and more than editing a role that guides Morrison to channels at the same time .... But how important is this film about the famous 14-inch movies! Australian crime movies flicker all the time and go beyond graphic violence instead ... As one celebrity once said about the double standards of cinema in the United States: "Kiss the breast, X, stab and move PG 13." WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long, The tough spiral end We were all happy to escape from the cinema. How many WONDERLAND movies will we get? There must be six in the past decade. Intermittent violence and faint color adjust the unnatural tone, but the camera swirl becomes tired, as if we are masquerading in gills all the time. Take some cues from the doors and the taxi driver becomes all forgotten the next day.
