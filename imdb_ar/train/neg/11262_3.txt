Adrian just left the asylum, where he was rich and without parents, his life seemed empty. One day, he met Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother was a prostitute. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian search for his life and where his parents are. It is a film for a new director, which is quite clear in most of the film: the scenes are not properly oriented, the dialogues are a little forced, some cohesion in the script ... anyway, the end is a little unexpectedly good). The actors are known and of high quality, yet they are not inspired enough to make the film fun; they all made better papers in another film. The results of the film are boring and perhaps spend most of the time thinking about how much time it will go until it ends. Of course there are a lot of the worst films, but certainly there are many better films.
