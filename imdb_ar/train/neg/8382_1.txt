There was a cartoon Bugs Bunny entitled "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was exactly this plot. Finster stole the baby's face from a bank and the money turned into the vehicle and fell into a pug rabbit hole. He was dressed as a child to enter the Bugg hole to retrieve money. The scene in the "little man" where the bathroom mirror is seen is shaved with a cigar in his mouth directly from the animation. This was a hilarious cartoon 5 minutes. Not much movie is complete. If you are really interested in this, buy Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original at the first time (1954). Plus you'll get a lot of famous Bunny Bugs to boot!
