His own fashion drama is bad and without magic. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was a great actor for characters. But he is utterly implausible here as a leader, a rogue in the eighteenth century known for his philosophy and wonderful appearance. Coaster is, of all people, Akim Tamirov. Some Frenchmen! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, as the eldest daughter of a rich family. Carol Landis is the best. The movie opens with a silhouette. She is thin, and a little girl in it. Disappear for a while but appear in an inappropriate position. But it is good. She was always an attractive actress. It is here that is closest to its usual role. <br /> <br /> Shikia is supposed to be a kind of ooh-la-la. It must have a light touch but an amorous relationship from start to finish.
