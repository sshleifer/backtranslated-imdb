This was the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen. I took my little boy to see this. A bank robber steals a family car with all the children in the back and after a high-speed chase, leads them off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is all left alone. No wonder her Christmas spirit went. Christmas angels do not save the children who drowned, Santa does not return dead parents! I thought this was the worst message to send children. It is better to tell them that there is no Santa Claus to offer them such a film !!
