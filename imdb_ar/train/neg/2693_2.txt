<br /> <br /> Although the main actress is amazingly beautiful, the plot has little chance of acceptance because many of the stunning details are faced by the audience during story-telling. <br /> <br /> One may think that middle-aged teenage schoolgirls in the 1950s easily left their virginity without thinking of marrying thirty-year-olds who barely knew, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One may think that a high school for young people is that teenagers have high confidence in themselves and trust in themselves as they interact with older people in complex social situations, but my experience has often been that adolescents are very embarrassed and behave in disrepair during Their experience in the adult world. <br /> <br /> One may think that the experienced medical practitioner will not know the stench of streptomycin - the fermented secondary product of the dense globules - and it does not detect that some of the bland powder is fake, but I do not think so. One might think that the 30-year-old rioters can enter a public school hall and walk through a social school and cause a problem, but I think that social people in schools traditionally represent a protected environment Parents, staff and school staff are there to prevent this. <br /> <br /> One last, around the Babu Riba Hey, the five teenage friends pointed out to themselves as the four. There is likely to be an explanation of why FIVE was a quadrilateral, but because it was never detailed, each reference is drawn from each scene. <br /> <br /> This film was not true to me.
