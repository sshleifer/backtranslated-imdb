At first sight, this film has everything that Nefeshni wants: a vampire story with restrictions "at least 18 years old", full of excessive violence, drugs, injustice, sex (including homosexuals), fanatical fanatics, ! But then, this is a series of bad stories (very thin), malpractice - a silly English accent that makes you think you're watching a bad film from Monty Python - and bad music (hard rock in the 80s), the video is horrible, Real ... In addition to the ridiculous sex scenes, this does not seem impressive. These vampires are reflected in the mirror, not even afraid of daylight! You are very disappointed, unless you see it as a Space Rebellion or Dwarf 2. I hope that Bloodlust someday reach 100 down, because this is its real place. <br /> <br /> I say it's still possible to see them, if you have enough friends and beer. <br /> </ 3>
