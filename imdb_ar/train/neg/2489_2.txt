Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Bossi, before the name becomes synonymous with personality The Simpson family) is an unusual policeman who gets results but his superiors disappear into something rotten. The plot takes on a different role and he is charged with traveling to Mexico where a super-secret American tank with enormous firepower and imaging capabilities was smuggled, by taking a hostage, along with the crew, by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap appearance (even by the 1980s), the boring little movie was a strange professional step for Gary Bossi after he left the impression of the flame of evil hair Mr. Joshua in the weapon of the lethal. He is only going through his cardboard movements here, ever more edgy and funny (though "butthorn" represents his trademark of the bad guys), but without the material he supports. Henry Silva has a bad reputation, but he makes a mistake here as an Arab leader (in a red hat!) And the bad text gives him some sterile lines for a dull dialogue that makes his performance pay off in a funny way. He is just one of a group of motion picture characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who pop up but failed to add anything to the mix. After the first half without a lot of exciting action, things get a little bit in the end, but they're too late and none of them are fun. *
