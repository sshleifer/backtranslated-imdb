The summary also says that you have just made the most obscure comment you have heard on RPG. Have you seriously thought they were gay? Are you intellectually late? If you go to go, save your best friend and someone who decides from his heart to help you, you are seriously indebted to this man. Lafitz was a good person and every time they helped each other, he made them closer to their friends. They were not gay lovers. To inform you, the game was set in a period of medieval times. At that time, women had prepared meals during the men's fight. Do you even know your date? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the army at the moment? This game has a lot of realism in spite of your very obvious slowness in its observation, and you really need to prove some strong evidence rather than the ignorant assumptions based on your misguided behavior to interpret the story.
