This one is bad. A bad crime film is really boring and does not contain anything unusual. A series of crimes, the killer you do not see in the entire film, classic investigations. As well as the classic story about a policeman who explores what is happening and nobody thinks, so he has to fight himself to uncover the truth. Not much in this one. Rating: 4 out of 10.
