I rented this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars, to see if that was really good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic picture (mostly) of the rotation of a soldier in Iraq. The film focuses on Will James, a reckless soldier who gets adrenaline repair from risk and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film lacks his point of view is the film's outline and output. This film has no clear plot unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this film is trying to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to be going on. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long but looks like a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The scene of the story in the middle of the film was one of the scenes of the film that was particularly terrifying, and completely destroyed the films. This was unrealistic, and very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought this movie was good, but the reason I gave it 6 instead of 7, was because it was a big disappointment to win the Best Picture Award at the Oscars. I felt that this film could have been much better than the thought of saving soldier Ryan who had the best picture, but was much better than this film. Another notable male is Black Hawk Down, who won only the second Oscars. Frankly, I do not know how this picture won the best. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a game filled with traffic, you should hire Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
