99.999% pure crap. The other was .001% a brief moment where I thought the blond chick would be separated. Both. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was bad. Sucking motion, there was no sex (the blond chick mentioned above wearing modest clothes, unfortunately, the entire film). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I saw in the film, and the historical paradoxes were numerous and stark. The acting was even modest between Crosse and Marina Sertis, the only names in this film. The Sartis Marina looks really very bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen high school plays being produced more effectively. This is the kind of movie that MST3K prospered on. Sci-Fi heads should rotate to allow this evaporative heap to air.
