A great example of how Hollywood (and still can) take a mythical fairy tale and spoil it stupidly. <br /> <br /> In the case of "Big Sky," author Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly assumed that they could be improved based on a classic novel by the author of Pulitzer Prize-winning AB Guthrie. By doing so, they removed the spirit of the story and any edge and effect that might have been a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Kudel, from a naive man from Kentucky to a successful man / mountain man is strong and competent, replaced by the parachute of a small river boat much like the author's intention. In the film's release, Bonn's existence is only sad. <br /> <br /> The shocking and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's new influence and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason at all. The most puzzling thing is to focus on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a minor cross-character in the book, and only occupied a handful of pages. On the other hand, there is a very important and wonderful character, Dick Summers, a veteran pioneer, completely missing !!! It is also clear that the director "Hawks" decided that the character of "Zeb" in the film, played by the actor "Honicot", was not disturbing enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a great deal of time to do this obnoxious narrative, a Hollywood acronym for writing, editing and incompetent guidance on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some of the films have already improved their books (William Wheeler Ben Hur is an excellent example). But this is appalling and frustrating not only as an adaptation of the novel but as a film in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is dull and cliched and characters - at least those that have not been edited from the text - are just shallow and boring shadows to see Guthrie's literary. Unfortunately, the role of Kirk Douglas, who was supposed to help him raise the film, was influenced by the role he played with milk. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the movie version of the award-winning "The West West" and "The West West" is also worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" reinforces Howard Hawks as one of the most vulgar and exaggerated filmmakers in film history.
