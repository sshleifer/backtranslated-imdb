Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler destroys everything about Annie. Characters appear to be less expensive than the story of a badly written story, and they reduce the sense of quality in production. It is very clearly designed for TV, but if you find it on your TV, you'll turn it directly. Children in the film do a good job, but the adults who act is unbelievable, so the film fails to attract your attention really. This film lacks the music / dance numbers that made the original text great and really takes the shine of Annie all the love. Johnson, because Annie is sometimes annoying and over her behavior .. You can not convince yourself that she is really Annie. Differences in the appearance of the character continued to bother me throughout the film. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.
