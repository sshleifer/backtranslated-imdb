How can a film be made so bad? bad behavior. Bad script. Just awkward everywhere. This is just a bad cliche one by one. <br /> <br /> This movie already has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This movie has not earned any money for a good reason. The attraction of black cowboy movies does not exist. It is shameful that they did not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie already has some big name stars in it.
