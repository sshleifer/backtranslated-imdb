Now, I'm the one to watch movies that got bad reviews and say, "Hmm ... that's not too bad!" I loved The Cable Guy, and I thought My Big Fat Independent was great. Keep in mind that I did not start watching this with much hope, but I thought maybe ... maybe ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at. I was wrong. In no time at all during my suffering through this "film" (and I use that term frugally) so that I was about to be a moderate entertainer. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino looks like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap, but as far as I can tell, the Amish priest might make the rapper better than him. The main character is simply annoying, not personal easy to love. Quite frankly, it is better to take the greasy lotion from the blood clots of the clown's nanny than to watch this again.
