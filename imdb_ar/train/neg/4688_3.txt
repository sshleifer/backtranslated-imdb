It was a bad idea to let the classroom see this in English. Serious and educational films can have an impact, but this film seems to have had no effect on the separation. Whenever the teacher leaves, the conversation begins quickly - and I have not heard the words "Shakespeare" or "Storm" used at all. When you look at this, it is easy to see why. Acting is not something special - everyone seems to be bored of the bits, just reading the page without care in the world. Shakespeare always favored an interpretive dialogue on deed and death, but I could not understand a word that one would say. The costumes are not too bad nor are the special effects - maybe the chapter did not like the film, but they did not take the exact pictures. But it's hard to joke in a movie devoid of any kind of inspiration or joy. The scenes on board the ship at the beginning of the film were not too bad - although the rain seemed a little unrealistic, but everything else was good and good. But where were the broken heads and the explosive bracelet? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's personality was taken much more seriously if he was dressed - but as was everything in the show, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is not attractive in either sex. Women and girls will have no emotional or comedy relationship to enjoy, and there are plenty of nude men and lack of movement or death that will postpone most men and boys. The storm did not work badly, but it looked like something producers were doing, not something they wanted to make. Public boredom and lack of inspiration. 10/03
