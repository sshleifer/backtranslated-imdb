This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen. Do not Rent This movie must be made by another film maker. It starts with some plot, then quickly fades to nothing. I think I would rather watch dry paint then look at the lid. The actors were awful, the plot quickly faded, photography left a lot of work to be done. There is one good thing to say about this crap film. If you rent this movie, your money will be lost. I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but that was a waste of time. Learn to learn, learn to act, learn to learn, learn and guide. I feel I have to sue these holes which made this film for money wasted on the cost of rent and lost time.
