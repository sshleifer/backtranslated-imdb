This claw in the film sets a new standard for making bad films. Jared Rushton gives enough performance to a very bad character in a bad film, creating a net effect for a very bad film. The main thrust of the film is how the boy's temporary journey into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a separate plane crash allows a disgruntled teenager to deal with his grief by discovering his mother's out-of-wedlock relationship. Unfortunately, it turns into a strange set of random "survival events" (including two hokey scenes involving bear fighting) and strange hallucinations make you wonder if this child is not just sitting in an alley somewhere on a pot dreaming of this The entire movie (and what a nightmare!). Moreover, despite some reviewers' references to the family's ability to see the film, there are many scenes that are not suitable for very young children or for family viewing, including a graphic scene of the underwater pilot and one of his eyes seems to have exploded. <br /> <br /> All in all, a terrible film no one should be exposed to, far less innocent children.
