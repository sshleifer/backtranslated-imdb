This stupid comedy does a good job of wasting comedy talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused here. I may have laughed repeatedly or twice during this film, but in general, it's a boring film, with a little bit of stupidity thrown out. The premise, though routine, was not bad, but once the plot was set, the movie did not go anywhere. Do not waste your time with this imbalance.
