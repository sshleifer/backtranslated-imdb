I totally agree with the other comment that someone must do, what is a tiger tulip with this film. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French movies I've seen in a long time (actually with Brotherwood of Wolves, 2 awesome movies in a very short period of time). <br /> <br /> It is really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea type of fun. I was Antoine Dekoniz in particular and Jean Rochefort among my dearest, I was very disappointed to see them being threatened in a poor film. <br /> <br /> If Duyun is very bad, as always proves that the beautiful face famous parents can get you into movies, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you want to laugh, watch Alain Chabat instead or a nice fun part like LA FILLE DE DARTARTNAN.
