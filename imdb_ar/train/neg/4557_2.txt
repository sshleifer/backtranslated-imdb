Well, it's very rare to complain about something I got for free. So I think this film has driven me so far. I saw him at the Hollywood Cemetery for free and went out very disappointed. A member of the audience asked the director about the use of original American references such as "ends" rather than being converted into a better film, basically saying everything that failed. <br /> <br /> Natural American references --- Native American references really felt misplaced and crowded. It is clear that this director and writer tried to address a yard they had not played before. They must stick to the old adage of "writing about something you know". If they are really familiar with this it certainly has not appeared in the film or has not been given the beauty of this unique culture of justice proper. <br /> <br /> Cliché and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to see this movie on the basis that it was indie. So I held for higher expectations. "Miss Little Sunshine" was indie and seen before it became very popular. Before they were widely released, I was already hampered by their success. Inappropriately I could not say the same about the "expiration date". The "Sunshine" took us to cliche incidents, but the directors were so smart in their approach that the result would lead us to a different direction while avoiding the trap of being "cliché". On the other hand, this film was by no means a trap because it had already been surpassed from the start. Exotic psychological mother, couple Hendrix, ect. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that, but the best and worst film I saw this year were both from India. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I would say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the directors on the good luck of their family members in the cemetery.
