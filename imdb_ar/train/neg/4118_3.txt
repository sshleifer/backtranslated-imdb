While browsing the channel, we found this movie a promising conclusion. We were horrified by flat representation and the contemporary story. We found entertaining car exploding scenes, incredible shoot outs, and kits that crumble with the weight of turbo foam and cardboard. What was most joyful was seeing all the recycled scenes from the Dante summit, where the front of the church was on the school bus, the storefront separating from the main street, the top collapse, and the red truck running down the alley road and the bricks falling on it. It was a good laugh even though it was unintended, leaving the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended to parody disaster movies.
