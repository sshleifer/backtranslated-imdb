I started this review with Big Giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read more ... Here comes, avoid your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always lives in other slanted films, kills here. There, you've just saved 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that were thrown together in the mid-1980s. Although the heroine is killed, it is just a scrap below the required level. <br /> <br /> Both priests and university students have a bad experience here. They are portrayed as hostile, with a high degree of social interest and who have a lot of internal problems to deal with what looks like life on campus ... University students go to the worst. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" just put it in a VCR when you do not have anything better, although I suggest watching your head clean, it will be fun. <br /> <br /> This (R) is classified as strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and sexual references. <br /> <br />
