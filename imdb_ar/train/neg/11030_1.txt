I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest, it was one of the worst movies I've ever had. Do not get me wrong, there are bad, funny and entertaining movies (like "Manos ?? Hands of Fate") and bad bad movies. (This one falls into the last category). The filming was incredible, not in a good way. It seemed as if the photographer deliberately kept everything away from focus (except for an unwarranted nip shot), the lighting was something between "one man running with a light bulb" and "nonexistent". The actors were as bad as the soap players but they were not as bad with the porn actors and gave the impression that each line was a complete surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the appearance of the convincing killer, the classic form of Jason Vorhis from "Friday XIII." The plot was very bad, and the end was worse. I would just recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie does not appear, or maybe a sleeper needs to sleep.
