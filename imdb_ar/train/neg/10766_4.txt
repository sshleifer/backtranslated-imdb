Anyone who thinks people who eat Tamuz knows that this is the way out can do a better job. Let's hope there will be a case of having too many hands in the bet (ie, a Telefilm person?) And this was a second case of concern. The characters are one dimensional and more than used. The scenery is superb however the Pacific displays a beautiful Northwest. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Almost shot almost out, the pictures are clear and beautiful. You can smell the wind blowing through the leaves almost. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film looks as good as it does - it lacks the heart.
