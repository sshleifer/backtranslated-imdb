A vulgar mess squash pretended as comedy. Elvis Presley plays the role of an Indian bull hero leaving Rodeo to stay at home along his parents' desert in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in a family cattle herd (which is in dire need of a lover). What director Peter Tuxbury needs is some narrative skills, although what he lacks in the assessment is compensated for by the erratic comic montage (his social comment is not exactly pointed, but Tuxbury has a curvature of his foreign efforts and there are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful supporting turns by Katie Grado and Joanne Blondell, the overall sense of loss is out of control, and there are plenty of trunks and cholera to keep a lot of attention. As for Elvis, he is full of passion and passion all the time - and although it is good to see him enjoying the screen, one has to wonder if he has abandoned the films at this stage. This shame in a picture has a peculiar sense of hell, and despite the high morale, the returns are often low. * 1/2 of ****
