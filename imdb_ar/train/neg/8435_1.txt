Very disappointing film. In the end I no longer care about any of the characters. I enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was as good as always, still not worth watching. It begins by force and remains weaker and weaker. You will like insomnia because I am sure it will lead them to sleep.
