I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and I always remember it as my first experience with a scary film with a good commercial. The announcement was great, but I later discovered that it had every explosion or "special effect" in the entire film (about 4) and even some that were not in the film. There was a kind of conspiracy about foreigners but aliens were not shown in the film as much as I remember. It was clearly the case of someone making a cheap film designed to deceive people. I think the world of innocence ended that day, when I discovered there were bad people there making bad films.
