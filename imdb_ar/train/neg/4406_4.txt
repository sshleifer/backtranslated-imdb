The star-studded Spanish science fiction hybrid / sci-fi star David Warbeck stands out as a reporter in Miami selected by the Atlantis ghost to prevent an evil businessman (Oscar nominee John Ireland) from using an embryo to brainwash using asteroid bacteria to rule the world. Have you got all this? Despite this loopy plot, this is actually quite bear and cynical RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS in contempt. Frankly, the most creative (intentional) thing about this click is a slight rephrase of Hippy Hancock's COP BEVERLY HILLS for opening titles. The most unintentionally creative part of a scene in a laboratory has been inexplicably introduced twice. Maybe Alberto Di Martino wanted to get all the vanguard in the twilight of his career? I would have announced the worst film in Ireland in his autobiography, but then I watched the SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS list listed there. I would also like to safely announce that I am probably the only person in the history of the world that I do through the dual advantage of this and Hertcock's VERTIGO.
