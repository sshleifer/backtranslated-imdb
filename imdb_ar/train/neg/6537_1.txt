Be careful first that I watched this movie on television and in dubbed English - which probably spoiled the atmosphere perfectly. However, I will assess what I have seen and hope this will lead people away from this release. I found this film very boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is lost due to dubbing, leaving the slow frustration of a chasing film. I'm sorry, but the worst sin in my book is to be slow only when the film is about philosophy. I have not seen any profound philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell him what I see. It has a value of "1". What can I say, tastes directed at the United States, perhaps.
