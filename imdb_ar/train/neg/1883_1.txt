I did not think it could be achieved, but something has replaced the "open house" - a low-budget horror about someone's death due to high property prices - as the worst film I have ever seen in my short but sweet life otherwise. <br /> <br /> Described as the best film at the latest film festival in Montreal, this leads me to believe that each entry must be made up of blank wall footage accompanied by people reading dark hair. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a small slice of hell. She is from Austria, trying to stumble along the lines of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet - scenes of different characters living in a dark-haired suburban area. There is the owner of the obese dog and his wife, the fat maid who is taking care of him, and the slim divorcees that his wife still lives with in a house that includes the room that was not touched by his dead child, an annoying woman who is out of sight and listens to the top ten. The list goes on. forever. It is pretty much like two hours plus I spent in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in a smart, interesting or even relevant way. I could not say whether they were effective as actors or not, according to the translations, they gave lines equal to the Austrian "You are very lame!" Sure, they did not learn much, each repeating the same lines at least three times in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a Gummo or any of the above movies. There is no art to be discovered, and there is nothing we should continue with, except whether you have to change the "never go out in a movie" policy (which is what a few older couples did during a random scene) For appetites, not so, unless you are one of the few who have no idea that your parents are having sex - and with some middle-aged local couples, to rebel). <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me. It is not a monstrous custom, not a provocative display, nor a noisy scene involving guns. I felt insulted because someone actually spent money to do that when there were writers and manufacturers who were able to look for funding. I felt insulted because someone from outside the city might have gone to see dog days and went out wondering if this was the best we could find Montrealers. Most of all, I felt insulted because the people involved in the festival somehow fooled everyone into believing that the emperor had a wonderful new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was naked as the fat servant's wife was stripping. <br /> <br />
