This movie was checked by MST3K and for good reason. First of all because it is a film "cop" starring Joe Don Becker, who we all know about the role of a police representative such as Michael Jackson, a western rural singer. <br /> <br /> Every plot of a typical police cop machine raises its ugly heads, fights the bar, the children of hostages in a shootout, misbehavior, lame police chiefs, malpractice, revenge / justice, endless fools and, of course, ill Act. You do not see this without an MST3K filter.
