The eight-year-old Jean-Roland is probably the strangest; the intriguing plot at first seems so frail that it can not last for up to 84 minutes, but somehow competes in an abnormal imbalance as it moves! A female vampire (wearing tight clothes, as promised by the title) is being held in captivity in a distant palace and only goes out to a "feast" with the blood of the willing victims (who appear to be members of a suicide club) unsure where he will lead, Has a human villain? In fact strange father weird strange heroes? Ironically revealed as a mutant (?!) Of the future! The weak pace and dream-like atmosphere (hunters wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the protected girl) is, of course, typical of the filmmaker (as with the beach at the height of the "fight") and the "cult of the euro" Biff of beauty fit for marriage on screen. Personally, it was the most interesting thing about the visually attractive case but the thinker is watching the character of the fashionable actor Bernard Mosson (who appeared in six films by Louis Bonwell in his last days) and wrestling with them from time to time!
