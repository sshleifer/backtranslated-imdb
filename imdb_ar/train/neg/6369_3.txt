The only reason for renting this was because of the article published in Fangoria magazine. Making the article this movie seems interesting. Well, that's not the case. This film was very boring, written and produced amateurishly. All the actors in this film are appalling, except for Don Donoway, who is always happy to see them. But a lot of time was focused on Gina Phillips and her silly encounters with Crows and Doyleo Marzio. Marzio enjoys a dense Argentinian accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. Also at hand is Nicholas Paul, who plays a super-cute love interest for Gina Phillips. Bottom line: This film is not scary. There is only one good scene which is another five to ten minutes from the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave it only three times because I love Fei Donawi so much. But even they were not great at this.
