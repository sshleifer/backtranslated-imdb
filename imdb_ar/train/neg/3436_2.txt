A girl is raining knowing that the serial rapist is staring at her in the ceiling. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on his trail, but not warm enough to find him after he kills, rapes and eats the girl's nipple. It is fire to death. One hopes that this is the end of the film. Not because they are too scary, but because the level of representation is very shocking. Unfortunately, this is not the end. Months later, the rapist was revived as a zombie by Satanists. So it continues where it stops, with the investigators in the case again, this time the baby is also flying behind him (do not ask). There were very good VERY low budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty in mind), but this film gets rid of the bottom of the barrel. Terrible acting, Dime Dime stores special effects, and try lame in comedy and oh, and the end also sucks. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: F <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Theresa Bestul gets a minus; To get naked
