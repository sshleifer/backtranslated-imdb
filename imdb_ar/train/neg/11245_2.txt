I entered the theater to Sky Captain in 2004 and I expect a good film. Almost every review of this film was positive, the effects were attractive, and the initial interviews were convincing. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, disappointment does not really describe the feeling I got from this film. He was angry. <br /> <br /> Beyond being boring and bad writing, the reason why this movie got two stars out of 10 stars is that everything in the movie was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between salutation and theft: this was a robbery. More importantly, it seems that filmmakers have not stolen progress to the point or move the plot. They just stole to show they could. There is no literal meaning to display a clip of The Wizard of Oz in one of the plays at the beginning of the film except for another scene (I will not go into its details) stolen from the same film. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even revolving around an old concept: it was literally just a rephrase of something I had already seen, of the pulp era robots reminiscent of old Superman comics and the latest film The Iron Giant, The villain that has been used in countless movies, the most famous in recent years as the Heritage Mall in "Star Wars: The Ghost Threat". <br /> <br /> The theme of the actual film, most of the performances were quite wooden. This may be because the whole movie was on a blue screen, where computer images fill everything that saves actors. Frankly, this is no excuse for misrepresentation. If someone is a child at all, they realize that the lack of an optical reference is not an excuse not to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this film. Ansar are the only real people here. Almost all opponents are robots, and you can count the number of friendly characters displayed in the movie on the one hand. If robots are attacking the whole planet, should we not expect to see the masses of humanity emanating from them? Substandard performance of the main characters prevents us from communicating, in fact, anything here. <br /> <br /> The film was not the worst film there, and that's why I did not give it 1 Instead, the film was an example of all that was wrong with modern motion films: filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, Or authenticity of any kind, it drops.
