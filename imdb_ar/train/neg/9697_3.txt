I saw the first Pygmy movies and sometimes I did not enjoy watching them. There are many famous television / comedy celebrities who appeared in the first part and presented, in fictional fashion, typical small episodes of their professional program, and this is precisely the problem faced by the second film. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most of the often boring and often stupid "jokes" and always feel that their goal was to put each losing comedy in the last decade wanting to return to the theater. There is nothing important about the story: a typical fictional story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. I was expecting something like this but I can not complain about it. I actually complain of the slow story writers who have a full background story; their only job was to get many jokes and parodies indoors but they did not get anyways. (If you do not like it, remove two points from my rating) If you want to save money and get bad jokes, then watch the crap that is distributed every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll get to know some of the "laughter" I've seen last night in the cinema.
