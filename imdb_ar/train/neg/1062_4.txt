Ouch! This was a bit painful to sit down. It has a nice and entertaining premise, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Moden is always pedestrian and annoying, and does not disappoint this. Deborah Kara Anger and John Neville performed surprisingly well. Alan Betts and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played the way up the top. I know that's how the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors when the text and director ask them to do it. If you have horrible characters, this is good, but you should get good material to make them work. Did not happen here. Run away from the screams of this movie if possible.
