First seen 12/24/2009? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): A romantic fuzz on Christmas is not enough just to explain how the real story occurred in this real-life incident of a man who was put in jail wrong while trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen to them. Then the three children fled the family from home on a trip to Washington DC to recruit then US President Herbert Hoover. This trip provides some side-stories like her positive encounters with hobbits and dolls, making a story of a kind like Disney's "Disney Animals on Disney" not quite fit here. In the end, there are no details on how the president can help the family and this is another point for the film, in my opinion. The film brings tears in the end, but it takes time to get to this. The film is not supposed to be an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it has a clear fade making it look that way ?? So I'm not sure how accurate their information is. All in all, this simple film (it could have been more complicated) with a Christmas-like story was happy but played gently and without much substance.
