I go to the cinema to entertain. There is nothing entertaining about this film. From start to finish, there is no respite from the gray reality that pulverizes the life of this woman. It goes one step, without any change in mood. I stayed until the end just because I was convinced things had to get better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as is evident from the many gods that revolve around the cinema as the film approached with good luck. The portrayal of social erosion is not honestly a crime, but boring your audience to groans is not the way to gain public sympathy. Awesome movie.
