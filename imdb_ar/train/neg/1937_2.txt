In the first half an hour or so of this film I liked. The obvious mature romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was attractive to watch and I wanted to see what was going on between them. However, once the work was turned into the house of Ingrid's preacher, everything collapsed completely. Instead of romance and magic, we see some of the parallel characters inverted overtly show who destroys the film. The poor son of Khatib and the military attach√© who competed for the attention of the maid looked stupid - much like a sub-story of an old love ring. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to dizziness is beyond me. This film is a clear attempt by Renoir to restore his success with the rules of the game, since the film is very similar when the work moves to the rural estate (as in the other film). I was not very impressed with the "rules of the game", but Elena and her men had been given the tradition of the original film.
