I like Fulci films, and I did it already and not in a very cynical way, but I realize that it seems incompetent and full of people. <br /> <br /> The conquest is where Fulci tries his hand in epic genre fiction and does not really succeed. Structurally, it resembles most of the Fulci films that I have seen. Some things happen, some things happen, and sometimes one scene may be associated with another scene. Indeed, Conan looks like no groups, no scenario, no real actors (yes, Arnold Schwarzenegrets does not play an active role either), no budget, stupid-looking dog soldiers and a group of bulls. <br /> <br /> It's hard to reach and I could not live without the stained Vaseline gauze on the camera to give the music video a look on Hair Hair.
