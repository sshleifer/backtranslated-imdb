really? really???? I know that if you make a political war movie, you will notice but this film was just rubbish. Terrible in every sense of the word. Not terribly accurate in many ways. I have an easier time believing that the President of the United States fits and flies with a fighter plane and drops foreigners. It is easier to note the few things that were correct. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. He has been overestimated, and the conversions seem to be meaningless, and he has had dubious cinematography at times. <br /> <br /> Utilities X-box, YouTube and ACUPAT ?? Did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you had to do a thorough search, it was only five years before this movie appeared. I am a veteran of the Iraq war, and if you spend one day with an infantry platoon or a ERW squad, you'll realize how PS. This movie is. To compare this faction or save Ryan's soldier is ridiculous. Why do not you throw commandos and Red Dawn there too; I think this might be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see the incredible plot, the historical and factual contradictions, this movie may be fine. nothing else. If you continue to hear the Oscars, and have to add your own pompous review, go ahead. For me, I'm writing to the director to see if I can recover 131 minutes.
