This film is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it. The bad story is a much poorer text and a very bad direction, makes this film a truly terrifying horror. The most important part is that it's the only horror film I can honestly say I will never see again. This garbage makes the ninth plan of the outer space look like an Oscar material.
