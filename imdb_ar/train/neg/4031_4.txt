It's really a scary trick for the movie. The run time for 70 minutes is very well padded with stock clips. The rest are non-descriptive exteriors and scenes of domestic prostitutes. Very bad plot presentation provided. They're all just a kind of routine scenes hooked up together. There is no attempt to drama in the scene selection but the drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a missile that radiates a million-degree heat circling Earth five miles away, threatening to destroy the Earth. It is a real-time threat that must be diverted if a dedicated H bomb can be made and placed in a test rocket within an hour. There is nothing to be reported here except for the crazy speech of a scientist against the project because there may be some kind of life on board and thinking of scientific possibilities but this speech made by the liberal idiot mandatory was by far the passage of time. <br /> <br /> What preserves this movie, rather uniquely, is the stock footage. I have never seen a group of more than fifty fighter jets in any other film. This is not a complete list at all, but only some aircraft that I managed to see. There is a short intercept by a pilot flying, in alternative footage, and an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. The first to scramble is the RAF intercept in Hawker Hinterz and F-86 Saber Gates (or the Canadian built CF-13s) and even a pair of CF-100 CF. <br /> <br /> Then for some reason there are the B-52s, the B-47s and even the B36s are seen taking off. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian planes are moving at 1200 miles per hour." I do not think so, since someone seems to be Gloster Meteor in the era of World War II, the rest is the F-80s. Meteor team presses the attack and turns into an F-84F late with an early-wing F-84 flight attacking its formation. <br /> <br /> There is an alien cockpit version of the F-80 that does not contain "this type of training appears to be T-33 but a sort of interceptor alternative in all weather with the radar in the nose.This scrambled in a storm Snowballing. <br /> <br /> A 500-foot-high aircraft carrier sees a F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors, 86, F-84 and more F-89 aircraft and then saw it in your life as well as the F-100 Super Sabers and the F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s press their attack using sooooo much padding. The F-89 will unload their rockets at the Peak Peaks in California. Fire F- 86s, the F-102 aircraft allow the loss of a falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With medium-winged rocket horns.) There is a very strange shot of the late F-84 model (prototype) 85 On the other hand, it is clear that the Republic Republic advert advertises the differences between old and new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet, which frightens anyone here. <br /> <br /> There are other wonderful footage of Ottawa in the days The old when the capital of Canada was a wide spot on the road and special footage of the New York Times. Box during one of the Civil Defense exercises in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> I think we also have to deal with the idea that this was filmed in Canada with a possible exception to the automatic hunt seen late in the picture where the Pacific appears to be in the background. The use of Jowett Jupiter is somewhat confusing, and there is a nice TR 3 that can also be seen. Canada must be cheap, and used unduly in the background. <br /> <br /> As far as there is a real narrative of the film I would recommend it other than the mere mystery of Ellen Barker giving the finger at the end of the picture. It certainly fluctuates someone. Could it be, R as in Robert Logia? The director who dies before the screening of this film? Was her career her last credit? <br /> <br /> The gift that was wrapped around it like the newspaper was more valuable than the gift.
