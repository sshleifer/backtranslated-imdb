**** Do not read this review if you want the horrific conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a complete surprise **** <br /> <br /> A muddy plesiosaur rises from the depths of Lake Crater to wreak havoc on a group of local retarded people , Not to mention quick-forward button. Calling the amateur "The Crater Lake Monster" is an overestimate. If you're not a fan of low-budget movies, you're probably not looking here in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem in the film is that when there is no atrocity happening, it really sucks and goes anywhere. The script is Ed Wood-ish, as it is quite intrigued by the way it sets out the main work sequences. There is nothing strange about the "Monster Lake Pit". By crashing a meteorite at Lake Crater, this dinosaur explains "heating up" the water to the point where it embraces a dinosaur egg that seems to have been resting at the bottom of the lake for thousands of years. Even if we could accept that the egg could have been there for a long time and remained exposed and viable, would not "heating" water at high temperatures evaporate most of the lake? Unlike some symbolic fog in one or two scenes, we do not see any evidence of high water temperatures, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The text is fairly clearly written in a few sequences, and will do anything to get the characters near the lake so they can be threatened by Dino Claymation. A couple only have problems with the experience of the car and while their cars are being maintained, they decide to rent a boat and head for Lake Crater. Hmmm ... Do you think those outsiders in the story could be there to collide with the monsters of our title? In a completely strange sequence, a drunk shop steals a liquor store and decides to kill the treasurer and a passerby instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of wine. Then chase a car, and you will not know it ... It ended up right by the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it's not hard to tell, and you're too advanced on the text you feel when it takes ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. <br /> <br /> Granulation, I really want to love "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can not do that. There is not enough here to move forward, and this is more than a movie being shown during a party, because you can speak it correctly and it will not matter. <br /> <br /> The film contains a tiny list of things that occur for it, most notably the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: the shadow puppet, the head of a large model being dragged woodenly across the water, and the introduction of the fully understood claymation that appears in Reality is very good. There is also a pair of beloved hex in it, carrying the majority of intentional humor in the film. The pessimistic end makes us sad for the death of both the beast and our beloved Hyksna, so everything good about this film has died at the end. Why have you been affected by this conclusion? Was it the sad song that played on the closing credits? Or did I just cry for the time I spent watching movies like this?
