I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen. I recommend this caricature to people under the age of 5 years. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, and I only watch it when there's nothing. I am now five years old and doing my homework better than watching it. The cartoons were a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing. Now I am older I am interested in the charming show we have not been classified. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things about a doctor who does not care about a 5-year-old caricature. The cartoon was short-lived and had only six seasons. It was canceled because of low viewership, but some people say it was because the book was running out of ideas, but for most other shows, they have at least 8 seasons.
