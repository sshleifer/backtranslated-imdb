Was this one of the most boring films I've ever seen? I do not really know why? Just your quick stories about a man about to get married and begin to imagine someone else instead. The story was told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what's wrong with this movie. Most of the time when these kinds of actors / actresses gather to produce a film that has already been produced a million times before, it's really fun. There is usually something clever where not elsewhere. For some reason, this one just does not catch your attention. You can choose some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason they are not funny, nor smart in any way? I hope to be new How do I explain this, but I do not? Just do not waste your time in this one?
