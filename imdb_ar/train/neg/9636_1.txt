This amazing waste of production money is a cinematic proof that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasted as politicians. From the play (silly) to Tennessee Williams and directed (by the dead) to Joseph Lucy and the starring Taylor, Burton and Noel Coward - this project was filmed at the Palace of an amazing hillside island in the Mediterranean. Winner when he was introduced to Universal in 1967. The result was so silly and boring that it almost defied faith. The film is visually stunning but this is the force of nature that has allowed the preparation and the fact that the real home is used instead of a set. Terrifying alien to Tylor yelling, Burton's half asleep walk, the moron dialogue, Noel Caward laughing at himself, the silly story and conspiracy apparatuses and silly costumes that infuriate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and a clear demonstration that famous and famous people can be just as stupid as the rest of the planet's viewers. Not so fun. Just terrible waste and crazy shock.
