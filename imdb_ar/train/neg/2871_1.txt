I rented this terrible film. The worst thing I have ever seen. I think separating the first row could have done a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies. Nothing scary but I paid 1.50 for a rental and that was 1.49 too much. The representation is terrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of garbage. The slauther house scenes are so budget-poor that the transfer B looks like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you want to miss a good evening and go for a little money to rent this terrible thing. Best clowns see the killers of outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors instead of sitting through this flipping again
