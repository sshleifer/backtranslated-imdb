This movie was not very amusing, and certainly there is no original or good place like the Christmas story. The characters (except for the younger ones) try to mimic the previous actors, and they fail. The Hellenic neighbors did not come out from anywhere because they were not part of the first film. This really sucked, maybe it was good with the original actors, then again maybe not because the story is too weak. skip it.
