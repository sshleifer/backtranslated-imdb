It starts really well, a nice introduction and accumulation of the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the magic is lost. <br /> <br /> The character in the same mold as the main protagonist of the American Pie and Loser without the support of the cast or the story that made the pie films more commercially successful. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heather's representation was so bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best, but did not have any plot or great texts to insert their teeth into the film just flocking without any rhythm or clear logical story justifying its length. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable when they come - this can be predicted so much that I've checked the spoilers for this one line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid at all costs unless you really have something else to do / listen to or watch and even then you will feel that the producers have fooled you for an hour and a half of your life.
