Try this movie to have a lot of things at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood turnout, happy romance comedy, family values ​​... The list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all, but there was enough interest in stopping me from shutting it to the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind World War I, it bothers me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when its goals are taken to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than just the weak writing and direction and production of this The film itself. <br /> <br /> Criticism is given about the internationalization of war. But mocking him in this way reduces the real horror of what is happening. Reminds me a little of three kings, making it similarly similar to a real cause of concern.
