102 Dalmatian [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous installment, and this effort has all the weaknesses in the first, a silly lined story, awesome because of the acting by Glen Claus, who dances every scene as if she plays for her own entertainment, The leading actors are incredibly borring and uninterested. Again, dogs are the only "actors" that look "real" and stretch. Another wasted effort here. Grade: Dr
