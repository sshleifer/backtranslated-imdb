- When a local sheriff is killed, his wife assumes responsibility until she is designed to clean the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what you do. When Sharif orders a curfew in the city, the owner of the local saloon (a woman also) rents a murderer to sponsor a sheriff. There is no way the saloon owner can know that Sharif and the murderer will fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and is combined with poorly implemented. There is a good movie here somewhere trying to get out of it. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger may have been an amusing look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, the Gunslinger is a dirty mess for a movie. <br /> <br /> - There are a lot of wrong things in the film: a support team that does not have the ability to represent, an organized and unnatural dialogue, and groups that look like groups. But the biggest culprit is liberation. I was amazed at the number of times the scene would begin with representatives (and horses on the issue). It is clear that Kurman is waiting to shout Action. The best is the sight of two passengers on horseback standing next to a building. Suddenly, they go off and come in a race as close as if they were running for miles. Or take, for example, people who can move themselves across the city. We see a man enter a building and reappear later throughout the city to install his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not like Kurman did not have a few decent actors to work with. While there were no great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to perform well. But at Gunslinger, they have not been given much to work with. <br /> <br /> - I've now seen both MST3K and MST3K versions of the movie. I highly recommend going to the MST3K track.
