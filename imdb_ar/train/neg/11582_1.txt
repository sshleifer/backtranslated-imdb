I'm happy to see most of the other people here are not thinking about this film either. She has some big names in the acting team, but that's it. There is nothing else we recommend, except for a few beautiful women that you can do in a movie. <br /> <br /> The story includes only "self-centered" characters that are self-centered, entertaining and entertaining that critics of national films seem to like ... and most of the audience can not stand. <br /> <br /> The Oklahoma dialects are so fake that they are laughable, and the racial stereotypes are directly from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
