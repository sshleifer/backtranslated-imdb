There is a reason why Jay Leno has not personally recognized this film. It has always ranked one of the worst films of all time. The representation is terrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself does not seem sure how he takes this film. "Movie Friend," Action / Comedy, "Puzzle". It seems that halfway, he surrenders along the way. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a shame to waste their time and gifts in making this mess of film. Jay Leno and Pat Morita before joining them, spent years in the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita was already a star himself, acting steadily since the mid-1960s as a star of TV music, classic films such as Happy Days, and sad but gentle Mr. Tina. The hearts of America won their roles in the powerful film "Midway" and "The Karate Kid" and a group of others. Mr. Lino can be seen in television programs dating back to the mid-1970s. He performed best in American comedy clubs. It can be seen in countless TV shows and major movies. It is shameful, they agreed to see with this nonsense.
