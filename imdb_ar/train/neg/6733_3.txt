The exclamation mark in the title is appropriate, albeit less than its real value. This film does not just cry - it screams loudly enough to smash the glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone have made an irresistibly sexy and poignant scream for semi-documentary feeling. Here, they shot real locations in New York using small "realism" acoustics to convince verisimilitude. But the natural nature of sound recording only amplifies the Staders dialog with Stones and the rocky history of the tormented butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a completely free-modified performance, Stevens plays the electronics wife. James Mason (looking hawk boredom and boredom); both are being held by the extortion of Rod Stegger (apparently puffy and bored) and his fellow scumbagers in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason inadvertently helped. <br /> <br /> The following is a strain of credibility. An example of a criminal mastermind brilliantly vigilant to every detail, however knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug addict deteriorates as an underling. The idea of ​​the Stones about muscle tension is the arrest of hysterical Stevens alone with the Benazrine rapist, Neville Brand, who fills the frame with a sweaty kiss. But the work of the camera leads to a great extent, and the brand (unusually) leads to instability so that the impact is very difficult, and less suspicious. The Stones, a boxy couple in the heart, do not enjoy the courage of their lack of convictions. <br /> <br /> The movie that ends at Steiger Stadium, which tracks the stevens of the fleet on the subway track, is as clumsy as heavy. With Angie Dickinson as an unethical friend of Steiger, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.
