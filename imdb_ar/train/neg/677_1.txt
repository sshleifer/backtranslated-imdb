Shuddered to think about what people should think about the environment after watching this piece of arrogant and preaching vampires. Filled with enough Indian wannabe pottery and the space brother's mantel to store a new store, Starlight makes anyone give a curse around the planet that looks like an idiot wearing feathers wearing a crystal. <br /> <br /> The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide the flute underwear model in an underground effort to avoid imminent environmental collapse of the Earth. But they must first defeat an evil alien who does not look anything like a refugee from Castro Street Bar. Luckily, they have got the mystic Grandpa Willy Nelson to help (which seems very awkward of the proceedings as well as must be) along with cheap buckets of F / X and rimat from meaningless music. <br /> <br /> Surely, the high-mystery script helps hide a vulgar plot of film and amazing speed, but that's just the tip of iceberg iceberg. You must cancel the union cards for everyone interested in this film until they complete a real course in environmental science.
