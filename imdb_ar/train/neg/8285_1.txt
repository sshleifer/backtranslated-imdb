Maybe this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only does Jessica Simpson lack any skill in acting, but the script is very shallow and lame. In fact, you hear a serious dialogue that says "I love you more". "no I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour and could not see it anymore. The "Southern Girl Charm" does not work and it is really annoying; its attempts at humor are flat and it offers lines like reading the text directly from the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not he read the text before he agreed to do so, or did he die with the promise of Papa (Jessica Abby and also the producer of the film) with big profits? Hopefully he knows better now than signing in to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is really a good actor - I hate to see the painful look on his face because he is suffering from bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this film 8 out of 10 was most likely either participating in the movie in some way or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in his right mind will find this film attractive. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, does not she? Maybe buy some acting lessons?
