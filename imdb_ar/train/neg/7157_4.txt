First seen 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Alereyda): A strange story about a sad witch trying to capture immortality by inheriting the body of her granddaughter. At least I think this is the relationship. There is a kind of strangeness throughout this film no different from Stephen Kings The Shining. The difference is that there was an attraction in Nicholson's performance that was never entertained in this film. All this is taken seriously until near the end when some lame lines do not work and attempts to lift the mood at all. The presentations are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very smoothly and leaves the viewer with a lot of information and there is no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small performance directed by Christopher Wallkin as his granddaughter uncle, which of course gives him the best bills to try to sell the film. Do not buy in this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
