This film was taken in the hope that it would be similar to "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (highly recommended). Boy, what a disappointment! The film was filmed in a fictional documentary style known to the office but failed to present it. The reason is partly hard work but mostly writing and output. True, it may be funny to use all clich√©s revolving around role-playing, but here it is done in a very predictable way. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what "humor" will be. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is filmed on top. There is no accuracy in this film. If there are "laugh now" or "cheap" laughs in the 1980s, it will not make much difference. With some scenes, you can not think of "Yes, I understand why they think it would be funny," but how this is done removes all the momentum for the joke.
