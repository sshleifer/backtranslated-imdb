Five years after the original Creepshow show, another series of Underworld Terror was developed by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories are truly original or distinct either. The first story is a basic horror story about an Indian wooden statue seeking revenge from the killers of its owners. The effects are truly fascinating in this story, but it is fashionable to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamor play with elderly shopkeepers. The second story, "The Raft," is Stephen King's story. It is about four teenagers who are inadvertently spending their day on a wooden plank in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon children cry for their lives as they all do water stains for no apparent reason. However, rather than being suspicious, children are overwhelmed by dopey's bad dialogue and behavior, which prevents us from paying attention to what happens next. There is also some unintended humor in this part. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a new story that has been adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, written by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as an impressive film. It was then adapted to the famous Twilight Zone ring which includes Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-hiker" is the best of these three performances, but it's not without its problems too. Louis Schiles plays cheating wife, ends up running around the park, or so you think. However, we do not know whether we sympathize or condemn it. As in many medium-sized stories of this kind, characters exist simply to narrate stories with their transformations. Wrap around a story with the wits seems a little out of place. Tom Savini appears as a "creep" in this batch. The good thing is that there were no consequences. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
