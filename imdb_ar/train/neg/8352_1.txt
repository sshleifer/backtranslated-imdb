I rented this movie because it falls under the types of "romantic" and "western" with some grand canyon views thrown in. But if you expect a typical Western wellness romance, you will forget it. This film is pure garbage! Romance between a young girl did not pass until puberty and an old man! The baby is also lusted yet by other men. It's annoying. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as a virtuous trying to resist his appeal to Brooke Shields, and her personality is often the personal one that follows the relationship. He tries to keep her away at first, but in the end he gives up and leaves as a happy and loving couple. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film can attract anyone except the child molesters.
