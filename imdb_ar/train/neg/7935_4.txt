I bought this movie and I feel very upset because I paid what I paid, but I would say that at least it is worth the rent for some wonderful deaths and funny representation. It's not a good movie in any way, but I must say I was very fun. I think it can be called a very bad name, it's good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the behavior is terrible, I feel I could do a better job, at least, no feelings. The story is not new and has been done better. I think I have a soft spot for any Carnival movie. I would say rent this or download it but definitely do not buy it. Not worth more than one hour.
