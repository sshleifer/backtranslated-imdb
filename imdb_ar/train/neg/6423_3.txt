The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown was swinging my finger on the remote control and preparing to flick to watch something else. The introduction of two books, on their luck, living in a self-storage "box" was somewhat amusing, but painfully poor. <br /> <br /> The intro of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big movie man, who lives in the garden and sleeps in a toilet, gave hope and decided to give it a few more minutes. A little later, Kristy Swanson added as a young and brave film director, adding a little spice. Her strong performance in acting has made her presence more than just a welcome eye candy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the low budget effects were obvious on the film with bad-shot scenes, stumbling speed and quick dealings with some images. Moments. Some of my favorite films of all time were low-budget, where I and Jonathan also deal with two men with a dream, but with their luck. <br /> <br /> However, for my directors, the actors saved Tinseltown from the archives of the "Terrible Film" and almost pushed it into archives "may be a cult film." I laughed out loud in some scenes involving character Joe Pantoliano. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terrible cliches, but still funny, house rich but screwed characters, where the story unfolds towards the last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was a wonderful play and as the filmmakers did their best to translate this into celluloid, it just did not work out. While I laughed loudly in some scenes and linings, I think the first 30 minutes were formed My novels and expectations for such a degree I would laugh at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you are stuck in a modern coffee pot, do not pick it up if you see it in a bargain bucket.
