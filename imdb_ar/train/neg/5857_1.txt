WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps the biggest drawback is that it did not follow suit for most of the previous Survivor series. There was only one series of survivors. The survivors' match lasted 45 minutes. What's more, anyone with a working mind knows that he will end up with the rock against Austin and the rock reigning his team. Do not make me start previewing before the event.

The women's title game was not great. No, not in the slightest. The main event must be the most hypocritical match in history. The alliance lost but guessed that after every 5 months each star returned a single alliance. The game itself was bad.

If you want to eliminate any 2 in advance you will have them. Everyone knew that Ken, Big Shaw and Windecker were just young people. 7 matches are not enough for the Survivors series. If there's ever been a bad survivor series like this again I'll be
