The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow "the man who was dead," "all through the house," and "dig that cat, he's gone." About a couple just married Peggy (Amanda Plummer) and Charles (Steven Shillin). In the first five minutes, I discovered that Charles married Peggy just for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car crashes on a dirt road and they have to resort to an old deserted palace. Charles soon discovered the secret of the Peggy family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
