Another steel die directly to the video ripped with the bad guys of cardboard? How many of these nastily evil gods (and evil) who were snatched from the most popular films of the late 1980s and early 1990s still lurk? For the record (not that you're really interested), this release is another blunt combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a full set of cliches and predictability. <br /> <br /> The non-stigmatized villains are the usual choice of cut-off crotons who send fire through various means as the movie progresses, and of course is a former cop hero or something who has family problems and attitude and of course he brings along with the only baggage party The usual emotional but also a piece of candy matching the eye and his son is annoying. <br /> <br /> The alleged luxury cruise ship between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as an intersection between a ship and a ferry. ?? This goes somewhat to explain how they seem to be wandering in a ferry across a rusty channel ?? In New Zealand! The representation is wooden like the surface, the written text, the predictable one, the wicked are completely incompetent, and the plot has holes that can sail. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no end to the tide of this type of rip-off directly to the video waste that pollutes late-night TV slots and DVD boxes of supermarkets everywhere (although this movie is bad Too, it has not seen the DVD version yet, but give it time!) Is there any chance for something at least half decent, semi-believable and most importantly the original?!? No, I did not think ??
