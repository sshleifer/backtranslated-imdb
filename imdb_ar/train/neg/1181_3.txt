This film has been so scandalized for so long that it has become a very important element ... anger, mystery, and so on. He had everything to be a wonderful piece of filmmaking, but he eventually failed at every limit. It's a very bad comedy, a pathetic horror film and a lame sexual film. <br /> <br /> The two-disc DVD includes a great booklet of footage, interviews, articles on Behemia, etc. in addition to an extensive interview with a director more than a buzz. For those who have heard about it but have not seen it, the package will look great until one actually sees the film. Disc 1 contains the movie that was edited, poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains a cut-out, in a bad transmission, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the actual monster? The hand puppet of Kermit Frog will be more effective and shockproof.
