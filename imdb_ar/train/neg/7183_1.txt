This is the worst adaptation of the classic story I've ever seen. They update it unnecessarily, and some points are actually just a disease. <br /> <br /> Songs are seldom moving along the story. It seems to have been thrown at random. The flying scene with Marley is meaningless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst music I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that there is a cheap adaptation.
