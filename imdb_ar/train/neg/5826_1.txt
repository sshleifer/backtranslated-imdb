The slow and nice images changed each other, with sometimes annoying music (known as Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the film. If you do not have enough sleep, this is the right time. <br /> <br /> However, in the last 20% of the film's director decides to propose the idea of ​​reincarnation, incarnation or otherwise, through the images of S & M: "spiritual lovers" cut each other's bodies with knives. For me it was very disturbing and unrealistic indeed the overall impression of a combination of abstract art and modern Japanese ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The operator and manager are great, but they're weird. <br /> <br /> I never enjoyed it.
