Very miserable waste of the film !! Nothing happens at all. No ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. Persistent and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is stupid: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of nowhere, because their train has been suspended for less than 3 minutes. What? The railway will not leave them a place to stay, in a severe storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead black fields. Or yes definitely. Or they can impose themselves on the vineyards of the railways, and stay at the "inhabited" train station. Station proved that it is only deadly dull, completely without ghosts, interest or conspiracy. <br /> <br /> It is so boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This must be added to the list of lost movies !! Arghi !!
