They really can not get the dumbest of this film that deals with 3 of the losers trying to capture the spirit of the college during the Spring Festival annual celebrations in many of our higher education schools. The problem is that these losers try to do so after 15 years of their studies when one of them is assigned to observe the daughter of one of the female senators being prepared as the next vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that she's a daughter who's only popular, but of course she's out of it all. The girls go through the drunken rage and the strange dance and other utter nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not get worse than this horrible movie.
