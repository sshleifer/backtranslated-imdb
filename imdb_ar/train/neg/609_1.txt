This was a very terrible film. Do not be tempted by Christopher Whelken or Michael Ironside. They are both great representatives, but this should simply be their worst role in history. Even their great representation could not retrieve the funny story of the film. This film is the early 1990s American propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were when the Colombian rebels were presenting their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso looked fake, and her relationship with false love was nothing but a pathetic emotional outlet in a film without any real meaning. I am disappointed because there are films like this, destroying the actor like the good name of Christopher and Anne. I can barely sit in it.
