The plot of this film hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also responsible, loving and caring father. Not being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man shows up killing a teenage girl without any provocation or cause and without emotion. This girl was the daughter of someone. I do not think a father who cares so much about his daughter could have been too cold for someone else's daughter. Or, alternately, he could have been very cold blooded, but worried about his daughter and taking care of her. The idea that the convicted murderer would actually ask his parents to take care of his daughter and sponsor her is an incredible idea. <br /> <br /> However, the characters acted with condemnation from the representatives. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bacola's eye made it seem colder and more threatening than it usually is. You can not see in his eyes at all.
