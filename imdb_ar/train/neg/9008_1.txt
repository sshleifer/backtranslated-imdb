There were a lot of movies or unknown movies that were given bad reviews I really liked. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> Camera techniques have been overused and used that made me feel like I was watching the opera series. It was ridiculously predictable and it took most of the film, then let you ask "That's it?". Once I decided not to take the film seriously and watch it from a vulgar point of view it became more fun. This one movie would end up on MST3000 if it is still running.
