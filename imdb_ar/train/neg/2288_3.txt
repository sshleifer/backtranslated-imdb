Who is my home page? I certainly did not know that while watching this movie. Among other sources, Ms. Big was very demanding in the post-World War II period as the "naughty" picture queen and that is exactly what this film depicts. I never knew my house, the woman, though. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian upbringing and the harsh domestic life that is only hinted at. The film shines on her personal life and goes directly to the purpose of the film, the "naughty" images. The characters are presented and abandoned within a few frames but there is a frame after the frame of Bettie in the pointed bras, Bettie in her belt and her stockings, and Bettie in servitude ... etc. The film turns black and white every time Mrs. Big Miami visits. Then we went back to the shadows of her gray life in New York. Gritchen Mall depicts Betty as one of the most sensitive young ladies she can meet. When my house admits to a friend that she missed being a high school notebook by getting A-instead of A, you could just assume that there was only a Taliban in its first chapter. The most interesting part of this film is how Ms. Beige's distorted images look in 2007. It's really sad to see a woman promoting like a pig on spit will not get a success at My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure whether this movie was badly written or that some obsessed editors cut things into their bodies. I would recommend it only as a source for people who study the history of individual lingerie.
