There have been many films that show Bigfoot, most of which is not good but at least has the charm of the idiot. Sasquatch Hunters does not have a thing to say. It's just a crash game. <br /> <br /> The Sasquatch Hunters revolve around a group of paleontologists, archaeologists and forest guards who go to a remote part of a forest in the Northwest Pacific. Bones belonging to an abnormally large primate have been discovered in this area, and since apes are not normal in North America, this leads to a scientific journey. Surely they quickly discovered a full burial ground full of structural remains of these giant monkey-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb the old burial places in movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is made up of shapely, interchangeable characters who pool their equipment, walk through the woods, stop for rest, hike through the jungle longer, and stop long enough to investigate and discuss some results along the way, with More hiking through the jungle, searching for a member of the group has disappeared, or even more hiking through the jungle, digging dirt and random endoscopy, gathering around campfire to discuss the little they did that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it only turns into people stumbling in the dark while being picked up one by one (this is done in a flash and you are absent from fashion and the actual killing happens outside the camera). All of this is unambiguously boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously and the director clearly tries to stir up the suspense, but there is nothing to be found, so we leave boring and drawn scenes. People walk around the forest just to get to a place and walk through the woods at night trying to act fearful . I would be a liar if I said that I did not use the liberal fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, just like every other character in the film, she does not have much to do and lacks a distinct personality. It looks like a more fragile version of King Kong, which is not so bad except in the scenes where they used the CGI instead of a man in the Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the scenes of a daylight monster. Part of me I can only feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a funny thing. If there is any single monster movie I think it should not only thrive through attitudes, it is Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that has no plot as far as the intro. That's all it really is, a hypothesis, that the people concerned have extended the feature-length animation without bothering to add all the components to produce a valuable movie.
