This was recently on the classics of the vibrant AMC films and I had to laugh. I had great hopes in this adventure, which follows the path of "Journey to the Heart of the Earth" and "Mysterious Island." I was very disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly line of story that reads from a five-year-old comic book. Be sure to watch the wires that hold onto the Pterdactyl wing when "Ogar" realizes a stupid half-half-modern man endorses adventurers missing. I left the door open to further rephrase the same effects in "people who forgot the time". do not waste your time.
