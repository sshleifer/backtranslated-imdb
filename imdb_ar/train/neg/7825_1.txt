I think this film is a fitting tribute to the first Superman movie, and it is equally painfully torn and painful as it was originally. <br /> <br /> After an opening scene consisting only of vaguely obscure images, credits build up to the future incarnation credits that are looking for their time in the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are some mysterious things. Seeing what I was a sort of mysterious melee at the farm, I spend a large part of my life slowly walking to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks into her and frightens her. <br /> <br /> After that, we went on foot with Lex Luthor in a scene around many close confidants of an old lady dying. We do not see the face of Luthor until the end of the scene, an early state of the film engine to not leave any stone penetrated without change. Lex Luther is a man who does not like Superman because he is not human. Also, he probably does not like humans either, since the film occasionally shows a sort of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of the earth's inhabitants. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent appeared in his back an old job (forgot to mention, I've been on a five-year trip where nothing happened). He then discovered that Lewis Lane had an illegitimate child and was returning to the Giant. He is so upset that he loses control of his superpower to the extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, Miss Lane is seen on a plane connected to each other by a kind of space shuttle. It's a kind of important event because it's on TV. Then we know there are people in the control room watching this event. There are also people watching on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people were involved in segregation throughout the summer. <br /> <br /> With the events that led to the inevitable disaster, I started to get myself soda. I accidentally walked into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore and it shows the whole slides. I tried to go back to Superman Returns, but I wandered somehow in Prairie Home Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then it's time to stop tampering. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my seat, and looked to see that the imminent disaster of the space shuttle Louis Lane was almost ours. However, it seemed to take forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, and created a child and sent him to college. During my graduation from my son's medical school, I remembered that I probably had to check Superman's return, so I apologized and rushed back to the theater just to know there was no need to rush. It took about half an hour before things got worse on Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was wonderful. <br /> <br />. Then there's a sub-plot where Superman is really crawling and starts chasing Louis Lane and her family with an X-ray vision and superlative reputation. Then he tries to convince her to cheat on Cyclops, who looks like a good man. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Lex Luthor participates in a series of competitions to display every evil behavior possible before the end of the film. I forgot to bring the scorecard with me to the house (they give you one at the door), but I think it scored a curse of nearly 100 percent. I hope to win one million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things start to prepare for a big mysterious end. I think the projector has been broken, because the movie looked like a loop of some kind for a while here. I remember seeing mysterious things growing from the water, Superman's disease, Superman's disease getting better, back to the mysterious things, his illness again, do not wait, he's okay again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor released the final bad guy moving: screaming at his little girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and returned to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> After ninety years, I felt cold in the carehouse where I lived. I realized I had left my back shirt in the theater, and I went to get it back. When I did, I was a little surprised when I found that Superman's return was not over yet. I tried to ask some viewers what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray cheeks now. <br /> <br /> I sat in the old seat and watched as Louis Lynn wandered around her house for a moment. Then Superman appeared and began to quote the beginning of the film, and since I saw this part I already thought it was acceptable to leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my assessment of Superman Returns. <br /> Oh, also, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about a dog that has another dog, you'll love this movie. Because there are two kinds of jokes like that.
