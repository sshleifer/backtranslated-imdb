This was introduced in the DVD market by Alpha, which is dedicated to Boris Karloff hardcore fans (like moi) only. It is not a horror click, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist who agrees to kill a rich woman's husband in order to earn the fortune needed to continue his work. But once the deceased victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his wife, all hell breaks down. <br /> <br /> It is convenient to see Karloff as another selfish, evil type, and some of the behavior is hilarious unintentionally (especially from the leading lady Mona Joya, who was a complete laugh as a double-crossing wife). <br /> <br /> But he continued with great caution.
