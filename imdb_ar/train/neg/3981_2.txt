This film does not really have a beginning or an end. And it's really incredible. Maryk and Ashley are supposed to be trainees working in a post room of an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are hired in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum), and all the other trainees they work with have an unnatural appearance like them. One thing I found clear in this film is how one does not end up with a man. I think they tried to misrepresent their usual little conspiracy. nice try.
