The "return" begins to appear promising, with a brutal scene of death by a mask wearing the murderer. The mask itself is very impressive and seems almost identical to the mask used in the film "Granny" italics for the year 1990. From then on the film is mostly dull. We've got a few deaths, which is good again, but there is not enough of them. The reason for the good death is that they feel crazy and bloody. The story behind the film is actually quite interesting and will work very well if it is not too boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this unless you are a hardcore collector - there is not enough here to make it a normal flick.
