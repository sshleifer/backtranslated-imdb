As a science fiction fan, I've been familiar with The Matrix since its release in 1999. Since letting people tell me that, I assumed it was original and very sophisticated. I am also a fan of Alice in Wonderland. I could never find out how I missed the matrix when it was released. With the upcoming release of Matrix Reloaded, it's time to buy a DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> The disappointment was so great. The introduction of the matrix (the controlling device on the opposite of the film) was clever. The philosophical hypothesis of the parallel worlds, and the alternative reality is replaced. However, I could still buy the film, as a science fiction, if it remained firmly in this genre. Unfortunately, it has become a standard, "Will they flee or not, flee, rescue those in need, etc." To make matters worse, it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science fiction movies and martial arts are really two different types. To the purest, do not work loving one or the other, and mix the two. It is like mixing science fiction with romance. You can have one or the other, but not both in the same movie, or, at least, not both equally much in the same movie. <br /> <br /> If there are such problems with The Matrix, the matrix reload really doubles problems. At least thirty minutes of film were either sequences of martial arts or a lengthy car chase. (This remark ignores the question posed in every professional negative review of the film: "If Niu can do something Superman, why does the fight bother you at all?" The answer, of course, is what attracts the young male demographic group to the theater.) Then there is the " Redemption through love ". This painting has been neglected by Richard Wagner for over a hundred years. He has been treated better by him in Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So where do those who see Matrix Reloaded leave? Perhaps the proponents of martial arts are hurt by vulgarism, but the philosophy of science fiction is ambiguous. Fans of science fiction were wondering why they were sitting at the Congo Festival. Most males in the audience may be bored by the silly romantic side of the film. <br /> <br /> Just what you are supposed to get for your country when you watch The Matrix Movies: Science Fiction, Martial Arts, or Opera Soap? Few of them do not make a whole lot more than any of them, nor a movie that is satisfactory to rapists in all of them.
