This is the worst piece of brain damaged, very cheap, super stupid, silly, useless I have ever seen, the incredible garbage of the moment worship among alien lovers. If you think "Ed Plan 9" for Ed Wood is bad, well ... let me tell you, look like "Citizen Ken" compared to those. Special Effects? ... Again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". يتصرف Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so he is far from bad, really. But if you're looking for this kind of amazing movie, this is for you! I am a fan of American International for many great horror movies, the epic Price-Corman-Poe and some great things, but with Star Creatures you go directly to level Z. Of course, 1 out of 10 works in the opposite direction if you want to watch movies The bad for fun (the guy who plays as a great Indian president) Enjoy and enjoy ... if you can.
