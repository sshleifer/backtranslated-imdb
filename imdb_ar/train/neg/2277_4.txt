"The Vampire Bat" is definitely a subject of interest, being one of the first horror films set in the 1930s, but filmed in isolation from everything so terrible for any real praise. <br /> <br /> The film is located in a European village sometime in the 19th century, where local suspects are attributed to a series of murders. There is a very similar feeling to James Weilen's Frankenstein, which is exacerbated by the presentation of Dr. Neiman's character to Lionel Atwell, complete with his misleading ideas of scientific progress. <br /> <br /> The subject of the vampire is arbitrary and only uses the red herring through doubts about the village of love for the simple bat Hermann (Dwight Frey), thus providing an excuse for a crowd of torchbearers to go on frenzy - as if they needed one. <br /> <br /> This is one of the three early horror films co-authored by Lional Atwill and Fay Wray (also "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum"). Like their other collaboration, the film suffers from the misfortune of relief Comic and tendency to move away from the horror of the prevailing elements of excitement. If we take context, the "Vampire Pat" is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> All we have left is Frankenstein's poor quality tradition, with purely vampire elements a way to deceive Dracula fans. But for the film, the film will struggle to be a horror. Frank Strayer was making Blondy films a few years later.
