Cinderella story of adults living in the land of dreams. Romance is very unrealistic, fluttering, lovable dovey, perfect etc. Cinderella plot until the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for Ngome. If you're looking for a romantic love story with a twist, you're definitely a movie, but for the rest of the real world people, I highly recommend saving watch time for three hours. Awaken people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who watched the movie with me will not recommend the film. We spent a wonderful time in most unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I can not believe a movie like this can overcome a classic like HDDCS !!
