Ulysses is a professor of literature who arrives in a coastal town. There, Martina will fall in love, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will start with a deadly romance that will end with the tragic death of Ulysses at sea. A few years later, Martina married from Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a quiet happy life surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulysses will make her passion for doing and acting without thinking about the consequences. The plot is very silly and no representative plays a proper role. In addition, three-quarters of the film is a sexual act, which is still well photographed, very tired, where we want to see more of the story unfolds. It's just a bad movie Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere.
