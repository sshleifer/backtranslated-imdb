This is the worst film I have ever seen. I was watching this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was no single pet. I can get more entertainment with a steady view. This movie was given only 1 because the scale did not enter the negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
