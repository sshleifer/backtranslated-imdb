This was just a terrible film. It hurts me to watch it. Almost every move was unpaid in the context of the film, and the acting was so bad (P.Diddy was the best actor to say something really about the film) and the plot was generally expected. Some connections with Carlito's Way were fine, for example his dream of moving to Carribien someday, but generally weak. Attention to love in my opinion was wrong but this is controversial. Anyway, I did not expect much before watching the movie, and I think you can say that these expectations have not been realized. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he is really a good actor (Friday Night Lights). It's lucky because I'm sure there will not be too many people watching this movie. I usually give the movies a proper rating if they ever interest me, so I'll go ahead and give this two stars. More luck next time. And yes I enjoyed the way Carlito.
