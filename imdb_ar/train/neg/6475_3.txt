Although I did not review the film after about two years, I remember exactly what made my mind as low as it did. After I loved the original small mermaid, after I was obsessed with mermaids' lives as a child, I decided to take the time to sit and watch the chain. <br /> <br /> To Disney, I have a small message for you. If you do not have an original director and actors handy ... you are only looking to get your faith. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the story of Ariel and her slightly older daughter, Melan. My first problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great in numbers singing and dancing, but in fact, that's what made Eric my favorite prince. It was quiet, collected, and a real man knew how to enjoy. him too. Not. SING. <br /> <br /> Then there's the villain. Oh, how can we forget the shivers that roll in our horizon whenever Ursula is on the screen, terrifying both Ariel and the fans all over the world? Unfortunately, this gene has not been transferred to her sister Morgan who seems to be useless. Never had anything happened about the movie Morgana in the first film; it's just pops from anywhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how cute. The younger sister was marked, and instead of pursuing Trident, she decided to kidnap a month-old child. understand me. <br /> <br /> Unlike being a flat personality with no sense of originality, Morgana was very unconventional. The same plan as her sister, the same disciples (who, by the way, did not frighten anyone.) I was three years in my lap when I watched this movie, and laughed hysterically. She had no purpose in being there. I would like to see my mother be a villain. I'm sure she would have done better than Little Miss Tish there. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not retain any of the respect he earned from me in the first film, and even he did not get started in Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but gracious father in the first film, and in the second, he seemed to have lost his desire to instill fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, a day of calm that made everyone laugh through "dingle-hopper" (yes, I'll admit it; I've described my fork as being hopped from time to time afterwards). In this film, he forgot everything at Scuttle. So supportive figure in the first, at least added something to the film. He was rich in flavor that others did not have, and in the sequel, they all stripped him completely. Sebastien was still as he is, but he was as worrying as before Disney, did not do it. Do not even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite low fat fish, who becomes a father and has many very troublesome children. It is fat, and nice, and it seems to reach a flat line at any moment. <br /> <br /> There was no need for rude and penguin, and after a while, I started to hate everyone. Especially Melody, which has no depth at all. <br /> <br /> One of these days, Disney, I'll start my life. <br /> <br /> If you do not like your assets very much.
