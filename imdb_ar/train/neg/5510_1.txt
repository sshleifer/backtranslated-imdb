Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. It's barely that. Most of the screen time is dominated by deceptive jokes. One gaffe run is that a character called a jerk is disabled. There are also a lot of erection jokes, where the punch line is someone who has an erection. This funny film like British Accent to Ally Kirstie is compelling. <br /> <br /> This movie started as a weak action film: five minutes from the back story and then bam! Funny jokes. But apart from the terrible writing, the film is also poorly directed and poorly represented. Also, this film is making the old disastrous disastrous comedy of having a lot of famous actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, although he is considered the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a drug shop selling for five dollars. So this is very much.
