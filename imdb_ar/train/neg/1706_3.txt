Wow, this was a very bad film ... As read in other comments, this film does not contain any plot, there is no evolution of personality, they probably have a type of script but it is difficult to determine based on the actual end result. <br /> <br /> This film has not already been released, it tends to jump from place to place without any connection or anything to help the viewer determine what is actually happening. <br /> <br /> All in all this is simply a low-budget zombie flick that has never been thought of, has bad behavior, bad dialogue, and everything bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from 1 or 2 is the unfair factor, I think this should be where they spent any money they had to try to justify. <br /> <br /> Unless you (like me) are dedicated to finding and seeing all the zombie clicks you can find, do not see them. interval.
