Many people see this as a classic, but obviously I missed something. Life in Anarin, Texas, in the early 1950s is very boring - which means that a film about life in Anarin, Texas, in the early 1950s will be very boring! What do many people see in this? Once you close the last photo gallery in Anarene, there will be nothing in the city. Duan (Jeff Bridges) makes this point at the end of the film. But even before it closes, there is not much to do, so everything revolves around sex. High school students develop plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some equally bored adults in the city. As you can see, there is not much they have to do either - except for having sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with bored teenagers) or winning the local high school football team. Happened three times something I thought would add a spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens because of that, Sony (Timothy Potomas) and Jesse (Cybil Shepard) escape, but nothing happens because of this, Joe Bob (Park Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing It really happens because of it. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the film came in the end with the death of Billy (Sam Potombs), which really points to the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, while the men stand around them as they look at the body debate where to go for breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovitch filmed this in black and white, which I suppose should indicate that this city is gray, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look of actors such as the bottoms, the shepherd, the bridges and Randy Quaid. (Aside from it was terrifying to see how Quid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character from Eddie Cousin in National Lampoon Vacation films.) Classic? I do not think so! 10/03
