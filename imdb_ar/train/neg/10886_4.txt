I saw the monastery for the second time. I enjoyed it earlier and figured it would result in a well-drunk Friday night film, some nonsense, some elegance, a little humor and so on. I felt sad because I no longer appreciate it so much. It seemed as if someone had begun to review baseball caps like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a fan of Night of the Demons, but there were some things I've already discovered. The monastery does cheese but not much good. Apart from the main girl (a lovable performance by Joanna Canton), the Gothic girl and the beautiful veil of Adrian Barbou were by no means all very undesirable characters, coexisting in the absolute lowest levels of offensive deprivation. After that, the film severely hinders the complete lack of nudity without justification, which means that in view of the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to see the characters and the difficulty of estimating the good points of the film. Sisters nuns are original in design and get a lot of good scenes, although it's not scary, it's certainly pretty cool, and the film also has a fair amount of elegance. In the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the movie becomes quite amusing because all the hateful people have died and grown into a vicious frenzy. Sometimes the polished orientation also produces good results, although the camera sometimes moves very quickly. All in all, this was a film for me in which I can not make up for the good points shining about the things I hated. He may have enjoyed it better than others, but for me it was not a good time.
