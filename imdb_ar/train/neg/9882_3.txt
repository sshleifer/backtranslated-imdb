There are two good things to say about "illusions" (both cited by a former reviewer): An exceptional beauty of poetry. She has footage in this film where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones an avenue for her money, and this is a really great compliment. Her nudity is short and secret, but looking at her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) The perimeter of the Greek island, with clear blue waters and clean water. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is no story, the dialogue is sad, and sometimes unintentionally funny ("I have touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a spooky jerk. Bo has overcome the naivety of her character, but again when she has to work with dialogue so badly, it is unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she continued to say the name "Damier" in almost every sentence is a great irritation). Oh, even though the film was placed on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to hear - it seems that everyone there, from children to the elderly, speaks English all the time. (*)
