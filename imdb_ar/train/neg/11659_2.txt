I loved the original * scary movie. I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite form of teaser. Sometimes it is considered the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans' boys seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original film, and then temporarily omitted it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans family is a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with promise. I liked the parody "Exorcist", especially "Come on, O". Now, these are Wayans quality materials. But, otherwise, I can only think of two more laughs: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes firm and begins to talk about marrying him. At the same time, he says, "It was just a spoils call !!" It was a little funny. 2) "Save the Last Dance", where Cindy's character outstrips a girl inadvertently while practicing her new moves. But even short-lived laughter is no match for a laugh separate from the first scary film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a pure trash basket, full of cheap mufflers. The jokes from the first film, which were hidden or implicit, are magnified and exceeded. For example, in the movie Scary Movie I, many hints were made to indicate that Gay's character is gay. This was hilarious. But, in Scary Movie II, the scene of throttling the entire penis with Ray under the bed was uncanny and unreasonable. This is the entire film style. Shock humor * alone * Do not take a film too far. This trend was in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As much as it pains me to make a film for Wayans too low, I must give this film 2 out of 10.
