While flipping the channels late on a Saturday night, I and my friends stumbled across this film. First of all, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? seriously?! His accent was much penetrating, although his character was apparently Scottish. After that, I was amazed when I found that this film was made after he played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film features stereotypes with the inspiring character of the professor. The girl who played the dowry should keep to keep her mouth closed. This film won an award? I can not believe that. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to measure our eyes after watching this for just 10 seconds. We turned from "kicking and screaming" to this, and we wanted to go back. We saw the 1995 children's classics "The Indian in the Cupboard" earlier in the night, which also debated Iroquois. The next line represents our desire to escape: "Take me outside, and grab the ground." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to watch it."
