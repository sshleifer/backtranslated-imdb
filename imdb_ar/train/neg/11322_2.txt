There is a word for this kind of movies, and this word is "drivel". It was Dravail when he rented VHS, and it was restarted on a satellite dredge. <br /> <br /> This may fool you, because it has two moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable sound music, and a beautiful Valley Monument scene. <br /> <br /> She also has some wrinkled hair that fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If this is all you want from a movie, it may keep you happy. <br /> <br /> Still, it is.
