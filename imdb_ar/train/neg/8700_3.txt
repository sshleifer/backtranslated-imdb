I really hope that Concord / New Horizons will not try to create a serious horror, or even an action film, when they produced "Carnosaurus 3." Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely a high watermark in the genre "Bad, it's good". If you enjoy the worst of the worst, this is for you.
