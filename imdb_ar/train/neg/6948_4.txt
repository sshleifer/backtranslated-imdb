An interesting idea (four American women of African descent broken into the shoes of society taking their revenge by bank robbery) has ruined it. Gary Gray is dangerously slow and scary texts (by Takashi Baford and Kate Lanier) are full of funny moments. Instead of making a thoughtful comment on the role of urban women struggling to survive on their feet in a world badly abused and humiliated by men, Gray, Buford and Lanier prefer to blame their unquestioning audience for high-end concepts of the opera tragedy. It's melodrama at its worst. Gray represents his actors on every tired line, and John Carter's slow adjustment refuses to pick up the recession, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the faces of the disgruntled artists. Although some actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifa is the fourth actress and actress is an excellent rapper), she needs a stronger hand from Grays to guide them and as a result, they start In a screaming and uncomfortable picture in front of the camera. Clear routing.
