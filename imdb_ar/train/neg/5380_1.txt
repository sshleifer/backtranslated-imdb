At the time of writing this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDb voters have given this film a rating of either 10 or 1. I can only think that those who gave it 10 were either members or crew. <br /> <br /> They say that given enough monkeys, enough time and enough typewriters, these monkeys, only through random keyboard concerts, will eventually write Shakespeare's full works. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you can find one single to give this movie a 10 rating. <br /> <br /> I patiently watched the first half, assuming that this film foolishly would, at some level , Developing either plot or characters, or perhaps providing a kind of social commentary or hardly stirring intellectual thought. If I did not, I was quite ready to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even sex for free as a way to get my attention. In the end, I was therefore disappointed, a large part of the second half was displayed twice as quickly as I searched in vain for some small extracts from Film Recovery. Unfortunately, there was nothing. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" is shown on an episode of Scooby Doo, I am afraid that the cartoon will win in their hands in terms of ambiguity, intrigue and unpredictability. Speaking of cartoon characters, the different actors' abilities varied between those who were accepted (at best) and the poor awkwardly through the portrayal of Brooke Bailey to the freakish gothic maniac in London's morbid death, where I felt very sorry. <br /> <br /> I wish I had completed a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second class feast for contemporary punk rock, has failed even in entertainment, let alone enhanced the flick.
