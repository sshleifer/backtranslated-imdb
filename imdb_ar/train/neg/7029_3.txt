Phantom Mall is a movie that suits the best in the "easy to forget" category. It is a very poor alternative to the famous story of Gaston Lerox, Phantom of the Opera. Is not a bad idea for itself, but plot and production of this film is a way of weakness to provide a decent tribute to that story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux does not have to turn into his grave yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall contains a significant number of flashback and no use, and it leads to many tedious sequences to make it memorable. Also, the scriptwriter wanted to present a draft of the story too much. Although there is a lot of ambiguity surrounding Eric's character ... the basic plot is normal and déjà-vu. ********************************************************************************************** His house was set on fire because his parents refused to sell their house to make room for a huge shopping center. The boy survived the fire and hid himself in the commercial center to avenge him. At the same time, he guards his girls, who are now working in the mall and trying to forget their loss. *** END SPOILERS *** This simple but effective plot is thickened by many senseless elements and disturbing conspiracy theories. Although it should be just an armed horror film, it is trying hard to be a smart film ... This is not what fans are looking for. There are a few innovative murders, but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to watch a comfortable horror film. Besides, Phantom Mall could use at least a sense of humor !! This entire production - including the cast - takes itself in a very serious way. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... like, for example, Ken Furee stars !! Surely the fans of the deadly terror of Peter will recognize him to blow the dead! This is like a horror teacher who still needs to find equality. Although his role in this film is limited and even unnecessary at all ... it was good to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as a mayor, a brilliant actress and stylish lady. Poly-Shore is also there, but I can not stand it ... so my opinion may be somewhat biased. Finally, he praised the leading actress Carrie Whitman. She is a very beautiful girl with little talent ... very bad never reached the top. In fact, this film is her biggest achievement and this is enough about her career ...
