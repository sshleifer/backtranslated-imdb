Very little wild work ... I doubt that if one shot lasts for more than 4.4 seconds. Sad casting, worse even than in the version of Kosminsky (Reminder: he managed to adjust Juliet Pinochet and Ralph Vince). But the rich got what they deserved. The dark and mature Heathcliff that turned into a gold-locked angel case, Katherine is fragile and the angels are presented in the form of a fleshy handful, with a melon-chested, witty, weak Linton, Tom is peeping, and innocent Isabelle becomes Sarah Michelle Gillard's character of Crowell's intentions. Eddie Bauer, 15, Abercrombie and Fitch, are noted. This thing was made for you. It's a long video of an hour and a half, where everything is presented to you; you are saved from the inconvenient need not to try even to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock in their actions. The actors tried, but as I mentioned before, they were neglected. Decent photography, but editing at the level of television production class in high school. I beg you all: read the book, or even cliffnotes; see previous versions of it, even Kusminsky; but stay away from many future reboot operations, during which you will not get the benefit of the first free offer.
