As always, this is an inaccurate picture of homeless people. The TV talked about a lot of lies about close-ups in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed we collected more than $ 100 a day when it was $ 20 to $ 40 a day closer to reality. When someone led a place where I carried a banner that showed up on the job, introduced me to work, I actually went and took work if I was physically able. If you have offered an ID of $ 100,000 which has died but has been invested in a prepaid apt for at least two years, I have kept most of the money in the bank and still leave $ 10-2000 for $ 1-2 NL and $ 2-5 for cash games at the casinos. I usually win and have always won well if I get funding. Instead, I win about $ 1,000 a month, all I do is always buy a minimum because I do not want to risk losing everything. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and getting out of work, sometimes I had between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 in a sock while I slept outside. Anyone who wants to talk to sevencard2003 contact yahoo messenger. I admit that I was different from most homeless people, because of the fact that I did not drink smoke or take drugs. I am no longer homeless, I am now in government housing for $ 177 a month, I get SSI and spent most of my time winning on online poker. My mother and sunflower worked hard to get SSI. Happy for my days to hide under the stage at the convention center at the casino while sleeping at night, and anxiety about being caught by security has finally ended. This TV crew chose me and they have finished a lot. It's a shame not to choose who to choose.
