One of the finest films of the 1940s, a haunted house comedy with Kai Kaiser's music. Kerr, the orchestra leader and radio star (and eternal college brotherhood), was somewhat at the forefront of Spike Jones, encouraging him to his guests and voluntarily supporting his musical group. He was hired to attend a birthday party at Qasim Palace, the kind where poison arrows imported from Africa are placed in the wall. Shindig faces a creepy judge, a fearsome professor, a sinister Swami, a lot of female laughter, and bad jokes enough to fill three pictures of Bob Hope. The songs (for Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are not something to boast about, and they are not sure of Kyser, she plays with elbow material in the ribs dating from 1940 to ten years. * from ****
