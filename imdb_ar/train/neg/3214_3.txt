First of all, I would like to tell you that I am in comics, anime, cartoon and such things. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this film. I will be objective. To start the story - everything is okay. Follow the story line of picture books as much as I am familiar with them. But the animation ... well, it's not really awful, but it's definitely cheap and modest. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the cartoon style and stick to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare dirty effects like fire and lightning, you can see that the film was produced about 10 years ago and even more. Somewhat similar to the original Vampire Hunter D of 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - four years ago they made a movie that looks a lot better! In addition, the vocal talent does nothing great, and music is not something special. So all in all - it lacks the atmosphere. I've seen it, but I can not tell that I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. It may be shocking to someone who has never seen a more mature animation and seen a first-time animated blood (is there anyone here?), But I do not think this is the audience for this film. So they can add a little nudity and spices to it. The chicks around Lucifer were extremely delicious, and hell, we have the same death lady! There are a few sensational looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown, I think it will look better on hard rock music / heavy music. All in all - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, you can use Heavy Metal or Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 or Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: shedding blood
