This should have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am 64 years old and I love football. I went expecting to watch a football movie. After about 10 minutes of it, I started wondering just how such a bad movie (especially acting) could enter the theater. About half way, I whispered to my husband that she was terrifying, and explained to me the facts behind the film. Although I felt a little insulted (and I can see how some would be insulted if they were not Christians) in preaching at a movie theater, this was not a big deal. However, it has been a lot of exposure to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of representation. It is a suitable movie for a church walk but is displayed in the church hall and not in the theater. Do I go to church? Yes really. Do I want to go to church when I bring a film? No. Do you recommend this movie? of course not!!!
