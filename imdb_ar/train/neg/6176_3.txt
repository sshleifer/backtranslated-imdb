I'm not a fan of Stooges, but I find their history interesting. I recently tried to check things out of every era of the Stooge era, but it seems that the chance to watch short Joe does not seem easy; this is the only one I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say that quality problems in the Joe era shorts are not really an air mistake, and I think that's the case. Joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about it. The thing that bothers me the most about this subject has been pointed out in another comment: The pitting of other players against the third violates the spirit of the whole comedy team / Stooges team. Joe's style, by officials, was probably seen as really inappropriate - although there were no real conflicts outside the camera between him and others - and this was their way of overcoming it. <br /> <br /> What is with the titles of this and some of the late Stooges shorts? Certainly a lack of creativity occurs there; was this kind of thing the reason or effect of short drying the market?
