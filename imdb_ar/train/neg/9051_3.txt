I was very excited when I found out that this was available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! This rare CD is similar to a band by your favorite band that I found at the back of the easel at the local music store. As a core fan, I was sure it was an important discovery. But once you hear it, it becomes clear why these dogs did not enter into a real album. This DVD is recommended only for "completed people" who must have everything Lynch did. "Six Men Wake Up" is visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks Lynch's subsequent work force, "grandma" is just immature work. It's boring and looks like a student film. But it was the seventies ... It's interesting only if you're hoping for the director's psychoanalysis. But you can see, in short, the seeds of some images and brand sounds. The "alphabet" can be forgotten (not really! I can not remember this at all!) "Truncated" does not make sense. "Cowboys and French" is just ridiculous. "Lumiere" is the only worthwhile group. Without a dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story comparable to his best works. I had to watch this one several times. But it works less than 2 minutes. It is hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying a DVD.
