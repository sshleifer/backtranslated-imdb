Robert Dinero plays the most intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie misses a lot of talent, it's really disgusting. The scenario is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself and not a funny picture. The film moves at a rapid pace, and is filmed in a bad way, preaching strongly. It also links all cliches in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in support, but what about it? <br /> <br /> It is also disturbing that there is a new IMDB rule that requires ten lines per review. When this movie has no value, it does not require ten lines of text to let other readers know it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
