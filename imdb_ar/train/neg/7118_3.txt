I could not tell if the Screaming Skull was trying to be a rip of Hitchcock or a tribute to modern Edgar Allen Bo. These days, someone had cut them off a bit and presented them as one of those TV anthology episodes from Old Tales of the Dark Side ... but after a comprehensive rewrite. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there seems to be a nice little story and trying to get out from under the ruins of this movie, and obviously the actors are doing their best with all their talent and materials to work with. But the director did not know how to show a dramatic scene or walk in it. Special effects simply did not work. The script reported its thread-plot points so clearly that Bevalev could see them coming; the sound continued to play the German Umpa band when it was supposed to try to intimidate the public. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried hard but that only mattered as a piece of time. I think a very young person who has not seen much of the thrill or horror may be charged with "The Screaming Skull", but someone probably will not get the young man over the sub-text or plot motive. ("Mama, why is this gentle man trying to scare the twisted twisted lady?")
