54 films about a club with this particular title in the 1970s. It features a good-looking classic waiter. Sexy female. His high-powered. Parties. When chaos is intertwined, it seems that the waiter (played by Philip) is in the bulk of it all. <br /> <br /> I will be as frank and honest as possible, avoiding any comments that are unfair or incorrect (eg, it's an "acceptable" film). I really find him a very bad film praised by his amazing team. Every time I sit down to watch a film that depicts Salma Hayek, I always wait to see her beauty, expressed simultaneously with great performance, but reality reminds me suddenly of how powerful she is. I mean, really, what he has ever inherited with the masses, unlike the huge table dance in "From Dusk to Dawn" ...? The same applies to Ryan Phillip, another poor actor who gives nothing on the screen except his good looks and an insanely boring facade known as "acting." Mike Myers, not quite as bad as 2, he at least gives the film something he deserves. Playing the co-founder of the club 54. Of the kind that dislikes the majority of the majority (that is, the work was done well), he performed a somewhat convincing performance that gave me a rare pleasure in the flick. Unfortunately, it is not enough to save the film from unfounded nothingness. Most bad "bad" films find something I take from the film, but that has nothing to do with it really. Neve Campbell is not too bad, but she is just "there." The story is boring, and it seems that the writer was more determined to make a film of this style and adornment and forgot to add anything else. No meaning of any category. Nothing at all. Because it is like most decorations, they are just meaningless objects, which are just beautiful to consider, much like the basis of this disastrous film. <br /> <br /> An hour and a half could have been spent doing something more exciting, like talking to 90-year-old relatives on the phone about the weather.
