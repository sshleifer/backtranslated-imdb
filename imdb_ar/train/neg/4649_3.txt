A 1957 (yes, that's the right date) produced by J. Arthur Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford and Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a comedy crush, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a one-stop movie: watching people get shocked when they see the little crocodile. The music is thrown, inappropriately and forgotten. Jenny Carson is a professional dancer and singer. But what was she doing in this film? Diana Dors is also here, providing great footage for use in previews. The level of representation is not bad, but in the film to provide someone with shame. Well, one has to do something beside the groans during this movie. The movie on VHS is now sold by people on e-Bay. Avoid yourself at the expense of wasting time. Comedy without laughter. Music without a song or a memorable dance.
