The introduction says: "This story is for women" who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve began the foliage system. When politics was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only 10 years old. The film deals with women's use of political power as a voting group. Prohibited prohibition and closing of lectures were the main concern of women at the time. <br /> <br /> Mary Dreisler (who is well-liked) has become politically active after a young woman was shot and killed as she speaks outright. She wants to close the joints selling liquor. He was recruited to the Mayoral race after a strong speech at a women's rally. Ms. Dreisler is supported by her tenants, her best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her troubled husband Rosco Atis (like Peter Higgins). Dreisler's nomination for mayor of Lake City raises the opposition of men in the city. So, Dressler asks women to strike, depriving them of "everything" in the "lounge, bedroom and bathroom". <br /> <br /> The movie looks much better than it did. Humor, frankly, is not very good; it is characterized by some non-offensive and moderate attack situations ("You look like Madame Quinn" refers to Amos and Andy). Mixing shooting and dogs do not mix well, this time. Producers may have thought of making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dreysler and William Buckwell's characters (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner - Mary Dreisler, Polly Moran, Rosco Atis
