I saw this late one night on the cable. At that time I did not know that the girl who was classified as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually a Savannah porn star, but she was very beautiful (and I got a shame often, thankfully) so much that I actually sat through this rotting game of the brain. I like cheesy clicks like the next guy - more of the next guy, actually - but this was far more than cheese and more rancid. The truly disturbing exaggeration of the crazy world, the director, the authors, and the private actors diminishes the eligibility of almost all people from the unwarranted rift, which is the grace of the only preserved film. Savannah, before becoming a Barbie doll manufacturer that has become a porn princess, is really interesting to watch it - it's very beautiful, bursting into sometimes uncontrollable laughter, a peek at the camera and a really good laugh, To the public. Although Savannah and her colleagues spend a great deal of this nude picture, it is still impossible to hide the fact that this film is incredibly stupid and made in a bad and annoying way. If you know someone who has a video, or if it displays on the cable at some night, check it out, but do not waste your money on the rental.
