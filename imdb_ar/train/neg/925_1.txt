Well, this film has a * cop in the rules. It is without doubt one of the most ineffective pieces of art ever. Very horrible, but you should see it. Rent this with your friends and get to a game to drink or enjoy your time, it's fun. The advantage behind the scenes is that you can do anything using paper plates and fingerprints. Wonderful. Well, just rent it for this one scene: two people actually walk in place for about 3 minutes. The manager says (in the commentary) "Yes, the trace was very smooth as it seems ...". Yes, the right man, they walk perfectly in place. he is very funny.
