I'm usually used to being impressed with low-budget Gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so unwanted that I feel nothing but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks like a TV show, which is particularly lousy and one in it. The groups are scattered, the lighting is flat, the result is disjointed, and the camera is a 101 movie school. There is no plot to talk about, the characters with one dimension, the actors walking during sleep. It seems that most actors must be practicing the porn core ..... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was the discovery of the amazing season that Roxanne Biggs-Dawson (Belana of Star Trek: Voyager) faced without her Klingon head makeup And rough. Her skin is lighter in color than in Voyager. Either it has been bleached for this role, or has been withheld from Voyager. Very strange in both cases.
