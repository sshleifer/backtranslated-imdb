Pyare Mohan can safely be included in the black list of one of the worst films made by mankind. The film, one of the many disabled people that emerged after the tremendous success of Black, ridicules the disabled brothers. Vivek Oberoi and Varden Khan are just caricatures of the disabled. While Black portrayed an emotional and emotional woman with a disability and gave us a glimpse of her world, Biary Mohan shows two desperate apes who have no fear of being disabled and hit half the world to protect the interests of their love. Ano music owner is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who started a promising start with Satya, quickly loses his grief in Indian cinema. Fardeen Khan was not an acceptable actor and deserved to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Isha Deol are just beautiful girls in the ordeal of her nightmare times in Thailand with no one saving her - except the desperate ones already mentioned. Iranian poman, as a villain without Tony, is fairly acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
