In short: this romantic comedy cuts off cookies and really wants to be more. She wants to be Harold and Mood, Annie Hall, graduates. It wants to be deep and humane. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, and editing, all giving it an important movie feeling. Smart dialog box - sometimes. There are some moments of "laughing out loud". <br /> <br /> But here is what prevents him from being in the end more than just a cable late at night, while flying, time killer: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - How many times Can a beloved puppy Joe gaze into the air with his jaw hanging before he starts to disturb? Maybe some saliva helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwyneth Paltrow - It's really flat here and not just in the box. It is supposed to be her role is this pleasant girl who is lively and emotional and continue to get involved in the wrong positions, and this is very puzzling, and that is why the sad loser, like Schweimer has no chance with. But Gwyneth plays it very boring. Combine that with a puppy and a troll dog (above) and you have little chemistry to care about. <br /> <br /> (I kept imagining someone else in this role - Kate Hudson, for example.) <br /> <br /> 3. Script and plot - things that basically do not look real; Problems in the end with such an elegant bow and high up so that it sounds like a whistling whistle and the scriptwriter just said "Excuse me, it's time to slap it, and got a train to catch it!" So they pulled out the Hollywood version book, closed all the boxes, and went home.
