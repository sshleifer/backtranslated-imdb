The American Association of Humanity, the customary source of disclaimer "no animals have been harmed ..." (the registered trademark of the AHA), has been monitoring the use of animals in film production for more than 60 years, after blindfolding forced the horse to jump until his death from Geoff's top for shooting in Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, this brutal act kills me completely in this entertaining film. I think one can say that at least the horse did not die in vain, because it was the beginning of the public's awakening from the cruel and terrible pain that caused the animals to glory in filmmaking, but I can only feel that if the poor animal has an option, The path you took!
