I must admit that I have seen a number of my eyes in my time, but this one with the worst of them. An alarming plot to follow. Sex and violence have been put to distract and distract attention from the film, which has been so poorly developed. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the final product and I hope that the dust will gather on a shelf not to be disturbed by a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have a DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
