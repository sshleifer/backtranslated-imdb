There is nothing I hate more than just self-congratulations. Kevin Smith deserves to stick his fingernails to inspire all middle-class white people to make a film about why they can not get a place. I do not really mind the lack of experience and low budget production, but when writing is clear and leads to potato burning. The money injected could have gone to a real film director with a chance like John Golagher. If you see Project Greenlight, you will instantly recognize talented visions fighting the system. Anyone can capture a camera and talkative image can not really say anything, at all. When will we save the Smithsonite and the World Whedonettes? The revolution can not come soon enough. Continue watching a real effort for the first time by purchasing Desperado or looking for Friends With Benefits. Thank you and a good day.
