Well, no one can waste time just because of a big star ... I think all I can see is a bunch of talent wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to me because I do not know who? Some pathetic songs that you will hear from? Some patently sudden transformations are justified by who? Race against time? You mean a waste of time? Well, first spoil your child, then teach him a wonderful lesson. We are very ignorant of this fact. He said that its wonderful new concept might be some other species than human rights. Let me make comments as humans do. The message to be presented, but probably given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus instead of going to a movie wasted like this to learn that Indian films have proved to be already many, and I can not waste my time writing about the waste anyway!
