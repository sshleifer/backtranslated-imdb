I just came to watch this movie and decided to see what others thought. I left wondering if those people who gave glowing comments had seen the same movie! This may be a good story, but it failed to reach the mark. The scenario is very weak - this plot contains many holes that make a large dive network for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the story story spread around so much that I found myself asking the question "How did we get here?" At least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of any chemistry among team members. This may be related to Lindsay Lohan's oddity during filming. It was very clear that everyone came and did their work, but they did not keep their roles. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth watching ... Go for a walk or play a board game Take a nice cozy bath and save your money for something worth it!
