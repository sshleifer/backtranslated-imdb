The East Palace, West Palace reminds me somewhat of the detective, with Frank Sinatra in the cop role, and William Windom is the boy. I think it's a progressive film for China, but it perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: a lot made up of Chinese legends in which men take the roles of women. The film focuses on a tacky man who wants to be dominated by a muscular man. He walks around the park without fear - and hopes that the officer will take her to the train station. This actually happens. The officer then tells the story of his entire life during light torture: he squatted for a while, handcuffed, and slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and implicitly, the gay man challenges the self-image of a policeman as a manly man. The story about a gay man's life (including past memories) is acceptable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese legends and dramas, the film becomes unbearable. Becoming a pathetic cry for gay in China, who just want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not talk.
