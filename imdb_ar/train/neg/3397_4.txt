This Trailer Trailer is interesting enough to rent a DVD. However, the output movie is very awesome! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst movie of the year, but it is coming to an end! <br /> <br /> The main issue is that the film does not know what it wants to be: Comedy, Adult Drama, Thriller, Teen Pornography? The story is interesting, because it deals with the pitfalls of brides in order to mail, but the film is in a mess. What begins as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the least possible terms), then fully reflected in the opposite direction, turns into a very dark and humiliating hate film. You must know Nicole Kidman better, and Ben Chaplin gets lost! As well as Matthew Kasowitz and Vincent Caselle, who I can only assume that I did this for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad film on every side. This is not funny, it is so sexually biased that you can forgive Benny Hill for almost everything he did, and the dramatic elements are quite bad. You should avoid a movie, unless you ever see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
