I rented this movie from the library (hard to find it for good reason) out of curiosity. I am a great fan of Plath and this movie was a complete disappointment. Bell Bell (1979) is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The text is terrible, not because it deviates from the new original text, but because it deviates without concentration or intention. The scenes are poorly built and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What is the hokey voice on Plath's hair? Ms. Lazarus had nothing to do with Greenwood's condition; Marilyn Hassett is just as incredible as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 years in this regard) partly because of filming (she was 32 years old during filming, when Plath was dead) and partly due to the fact that she could not act. Hassit is all passion, no craft, no skill. The trend is average. The manager simply covers what exists, which is not much. The only reason to give Movie 1 is that 0 is not an option. Sorry, Sylvia, you have to wait until someone else adapts your good work to something more appropriate.
