I went to the film as a sneak preview in Austria. So you have no idea what I'm going to see. The story is very natural. The film is too long, and I think it could have been reduced to two halves without causing any problems to the story. It's the kind of movies you can watch on a dull night and you want to feel more bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. Also there are not many effects in the film. So if you want to watch it, you do not have to waste your money and time going to the movies. It will be more effective to watch it at home when it gets DVDs.
