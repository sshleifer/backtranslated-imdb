The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad scenario is far beyond me. This really has to be one of the worst movies, plus the Haunted Road I've ever seen. The actors are bad, and the story is really bad. There are no natural reactions to any event in this film, and although it is Halloween, ordinary people will have greater reactions when they see the death of their father, let alone the delinquent, people with ribbons covering the airway, unable to breathe (in a room Including at least 50 people I can add) and a person in his clothes while the devil pulls the dead out of his house, and even the 8-year-old will see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one can be naive and dumb to believe the fact that Satan and Jesus appeared on the same day, as this child does. When I was eight years old, I was sure my brains were more than that. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be competing with this silent devil too, no questions asked. The question throughout the film is, is it really the devil, or is it a crazy person who kills people whenever they feel like it? Well, he has human hands, arms, build and anything, so I think he's supposed to be in the movie too, otherwise they've done a bad job of hiding it. Then, with this human being and everything, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, five policemen (all of them carrying arms and training I suppose), and a few other people. .... Obviously everyone was standing there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The full concept and way of telling the story is the worst thing I have ever seen and will never recommend anyone who misses 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total folly.
