I watched the movie last night and I really liked it. My expectations for the film were going up and down since I heard it being made. Some days, I see something wonderful, and some days I will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, because I am a fan, I had high hopes in this film, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> While I love the films of Richard Donner, I did not like its character at times or the changes it made to Superman's character and powers. <br /> <br /> However, the singer chose to take the worst elements in Donner's films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> While the Lex Luthor car is a little darker, it is still more than just a brother, a crook and a common criminal. It's no smarter than when he played Gene Hackman. Kevin Spacey is doing his best to play Luthor well, but in the end he falls victim to poor writing and discreet dialogue. <br /> <br /> His followers are more than two comic books. Most of them literally do not have a dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is exactly the same as Mrs. Tasatsheer's character. She seems to have been sinister and cool like Lex Luther, but she has proved to be the only god who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and waiting to betray Luther. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Angela Perry White. I was not very impressed with the top Perry White in Downer films but at least he had a spirit. After all was said and done, he is a veteran reporter who cares about the truth and a good story. Perry White Angela is not only companies. He wants everyone to focus on stories related to Superman because they sell the papers, although every other paper does the same thing. He does not care about real stories, real secrets like blackout, and what Lex Luthor means by now, after he got out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Angela is that it's boring! Some actors can be quiet and discreet, yet have a hidden current that lets you know that the water is still deep. Frank Angela is the pool. <br /> <br /> Brandon Roth is not a bad actor. It's fine but again there is no memorable single line in the entire movie. Not an actor's fault. His movements seem to be graceful, so that the smallest movement in his fingers affects the way he flies. But still looks determined and determined. <br /> <br /> While Lewis Sewer was remarkably well-behaved by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager in Dawson Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor in the entire film, because he often seems more Superman than Ruth. Without any superpower he manages to learn the message of Louis Lane, he travels by plane to the site and enters aboard a Luther yacht and saves Lewis and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moment of movement in the movie is when they are all trapped because the store is flooded with water and the ship sinks. You see them being slowly immersed in the water. You know that Superman will come at the last minute to save them but still you can not help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before the plot is very random. Unlike Singer, this is not a film about a supernatural hero coming back and trying to find his place in the world. Once he returns, the world welcomes his return with open arms. Lewis is the only person who is not happy to see him. Even Luthor is pleased with Superman's recovery because he gives him a chance to settle the score with a steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. He stole a large green meteorite from a museum, Lex Luthor got out of prison, and now knows Superman's abilities and weaknesses, yet he is still unable to tie enough points to know that a luthor uses kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only good thing that Superman enjoys is lifting really heavy objects. The sequence of work is all incredibly predictable.
