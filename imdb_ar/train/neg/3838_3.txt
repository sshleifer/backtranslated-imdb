Terry West had a good idea with this film. He just did not flesh through. There are countless shots of exteriors that look like a creepy school that last forever and perhaps to cool down the run time of the movie. There is also only a Taliban in this school. Misty Mundae is as good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to see the film at first). If the script focuses on her interesting personality, we have a movie to watch. It's so cool !! The good news for DVD subscribers, the previous film "Blood For The Muse" (and better) from Terry West is a special feature. One thing I would say is that this movie looks like someone who is not good at making a punching line at the end of a long joke for the end feels the same way. Then again, just watch this for Laroche Laroche.
