Watch a trailer for this other video, and decide to rent when it's shown. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, the acting (apart from Christopher Wakn) is bad, and I did not care much about the characters, regardless of the real desire to see Nora's husband being crushed. The role of Christopher Waken is such a get-off, what a tease!
