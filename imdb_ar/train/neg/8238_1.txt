This was the worst film I've ever seen. I could not sit through everything. I also think that the writer must have some strange fetish for women who are bragging and watching ... I mean what was all this! I can not believe that this has been, and I am disgusted that #ingwasted a rent fee of 4 pounds. The quality of both image and sound is terrible, the representation ... good does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie, and Paul's scenes were, crap, and dirty reminiscent of 2 cup girls. Urghh ....... Avoid at all costs! The girls look like they've been picked up from the street and only got the part they'll be ready to remove from the top ... While these girls have nice bodies, it certainly did not make up for the fact that their screams were terrible and unconvincing and pain in my ears. <br /> <br /> This was (probably worse) than the production of the ammateur school without any proper direction, no need for a set because everything seems to be revolving around a car ?! <br /> <br /> Select no one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment was terribly negative, but I did not find anything positive to say and I wanted to think I had saved someone else who was wasting his money as I said.
