Five minutes after this film, you realize you've seen it before. It is the boiler room. It is the first company. This is demons preachers. There are no new elements here. Except for Bill Gates, everything is clear. Plots are always good things to make movies, but why should they be extreme? The boiler room is a good movie, because - for a while at least - it seems realistic. In Antimonopoly everything is wrong. How realistic is it, for example, to get your boss to work as a girlfriend to make you work harder and control you? I'll give it a 1, but the sound is fine, so 2/10.
