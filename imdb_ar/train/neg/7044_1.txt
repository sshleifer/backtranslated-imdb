Sad to see Tina Louise's beautiful and talented turn into this terrible excuse for a film. Tina still looks good and attractive, but for some reason she looks really scared. I can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd stink rate will be released to the general public. Also, I am Adam West's beloved lover. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in good shape for his old man. His representation here is acceptable, but the script is very bad, so it's hard to even listen to the dialog box. <br /> <br /> The movie is a set of flicks from the classic biker Brando, The Wild Ones; the outlaw biker gang is out of control in a small town of Heck. The drivers here seem to be a mixed group and I'm sure they do not want them yet to identify my sister. The representation is harsh and vulgar, and the story plot is as old as sand. Hellriders is the hell to watch!
