Justin Timberlake, a Jewish newspaper reporter named Joshua (Josh Pollack), is puzzled when the defendant whispers in the courtroom "Thank you" for LL Cool J (on behalf of Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness position. In the opening sequences of this film, you will get an explanation. You will see the demonic detective partner of Mr. Cool J. Dylan McDermott (like Francis "Laz" Lazirov) decides not to kill Damien Dante and Ayans (like Isaiah Charles). The police in Edison were so corrupt that they shot the suspects, stole their money, and inhaled their anesthetic. Whether abroad to impress his girlfriend (named here "Pussy") or winning Pulitzer, the city's corruption is not well matched with Mr. Timberlake noble. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches both the unexpected range and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer / Director David J. Burke saves the film over the water, but barely. LL Cool J won the Timberlake in the lottery "Pop Star to Movie Star" (also known as "Rapper to Actor"). Mr. McDermott enjoys his role. Gravity lending in actions effectively supports actors Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. It means that the first and tactical response is attacked, but it is important to know that Edison is Justin Timberlake and L-Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems to be missing).
