This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and the best of it is Christian J. Molly Leonard trying to act up and down the bar, a kind of thing I wanted to do on a DVD, to spare the rest of humanity the suffering of watching this movie shitty. He has great actors, so you can keep waiting for him to get better. I mean with Sean Astin "Andrew" (played well, did a great job, was so bad in this film), Kira Sedjwick Biffan, Ron Livingston Chad, Zellweger "poet" (they put her name on the cover, she had a total of one line and less than 4 seconds in the entire film ... <br /> <br /> Any dignity, they will go out and buy all copies of this film and burn it with the writer / Heinkelover and writer John Inbom
