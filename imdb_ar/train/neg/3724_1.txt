I saw this film twice during a Pentecostal church attended by my family in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was six years old, my brother 4, then again when I was eight years old. This film bothered me from my brother and I and we formed how we saw the world with confidence. It was not only the film; it was philosophy that overwhelmed many "Christians" around the "mark of the beast" and the rapture. This film, the church, a neglected and volatile education, leads to extreme paranoia toward the future. For years, I lived under the phantom influence of the Church and fear of forgetting Christ. I am now 40 years old. Years of advice passed. I once explained to a psychiatrist this film and the belief system of the church and the family. I was associated with a placebo disorder. In fact, I began to believe that it was my brother who reminded me that this cultural philosophy had already taken place. I no longer fear the future, I have dealt with the fear that was brought into the church by members of the church. I have benefited from this experience to achieve a goal, and I am about to get my license as a psychiatrist specializing in childhood trauma.
