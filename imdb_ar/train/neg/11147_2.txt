I have nothing to comment on in this film, it's so bad that I had to put my first comment on IMDb to help some viewers save some time and do something more exciting, rather than watching this "movie" ... anything would do, even stare The walls are better. <br /> <br /> Because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I'm also telling you a low-budget movie, bad behavior, no actors, stupid idiots like a wolf, etc. ... and the story does not bring anything New, special effects are made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So enjoy! ;) (Do not watch this movie)
