My first attempt to see this ended in 8 minutes, after almost the TV report scene, which I could not deal with. It's almost like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Well, there's a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think it is foreigners. * Mute silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I saw it to the end, and it was not as horrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with this. Nearly half of the plot can be easily disposed of. The other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What is the benefit of mabahith, people of eugenics, and monsters that are disposed of moment by Horus? The scene was more amusing. "We are all powerful" goddesses, "who have lived for ever, and for all the games in the multi-universe, we face monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Eric von Dyenkin seems coherent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is very missing. What did our protagonist to get himself frozen cold? Why was not there a big event when he was finally released? He had these annoying followers, remember? What happened to ordinary humans? What is the deal with masked men? How did the girl with blue hair appear? What is her vision? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually, it is okay, more or less, if the Egyptian gods that look like a jungle ignore the walking with the rotating heads.
