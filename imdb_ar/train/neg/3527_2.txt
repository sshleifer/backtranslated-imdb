He had to see this cos looks like a great scary premise, the prisoners find a magic book, oo misses it! This entails terrible terrorism, and so forth. <br /> <br /> But there seems to be no story that matches the great idea. Instead of the cold horror / physiological horror, it has been based on the effects that occur in the horror of the open body and horror OTT, which is not at all frightening if you have more than 12 years. <br /> <br /> The logic is finally ridiculous, with characters being killed for nothing but individual counting. A waste of good characters - that was the best thing in this film. <br /> <br /> A clearly low budget, do not spoil it, the movie does not go anywhere, I think I'll say this - needs a Hollywood remake. You simply have a loose interest in this version. Certainly not in the same league as other French films that have appeared in the last few years like scarlet rivers were at least a walk / amusing, Malvic can not be seen until the end to be honest. I bet you can guess the end before you watch the movie. Really really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
