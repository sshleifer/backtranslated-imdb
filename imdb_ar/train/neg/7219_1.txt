I still find it hard to understand that such a bad film in Hollywood. The acting and the story is pathetic & the trend is awful. I do not see any logic behind this garbage but maybe the director did not have anything good. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted thirty precious rupees. I was terrified that I would have wasted some time in my life on this nonsense. I bet that the film was made in less than a day. I do not know what category they fall in. Please, avoid this movie at any price, just do anything, so knock your head on the walls but do not go for that movie.
