In every low budget date. This movie must be one of the worst. True, there are some comic aspects of the film, but in general it was just awful. I can not understand what no one can run a bunch of mollusks. I mean they must be the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part worth while while in this film is near the attempt of mollusks to bite a man's finger. This was fairly amusing.
