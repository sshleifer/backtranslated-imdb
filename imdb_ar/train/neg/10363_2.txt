I grew up pouring in on the tangled stories in The Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. It was my dream that the screenwriter would someday meet his child sitting on a big sofa reading Winkle in Time, and thinking, what a wonderful movie would result in. Sadly, the screenwriter has failed, changing characters, throwing lame humor, and all destroyed the plot. I know it's hard to change a beloved novel into a movie. But why can not you stay true to the book? Why should you change the way people think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, look for a soft sofa, and let your imagination fade away.
