Cuba Gooding Jr. is a Secret Service agent who blames himself for the assassination of the US president, and I will immediately point out that this is not the kind of role that this very talented actor has noted, and this film tells us why. He collaborated with a permanent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the plot surrounding the death of the president, etc., Blah, Blah, Blah. <br /> <br /> Even with representatives of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon "End Game" failed to attract your attention and simple and simple; some good actions, not bad representation, and the story though clich√©s have done before may lead To an entertaining movie - well, no! Writing the script and direction completely confirms that it does not absorb you at any time in the story or makes you think of any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
