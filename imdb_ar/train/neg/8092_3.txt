The sprawling Tom Wolf novel, brilliantly observed in sarcastic life in New York, gets a glossy look here, but nevertheless does not offer good services. The film does not only suffer from insulting every man Tom Hanks as an unyielding jubilee, Kyube's puppet Melanie Griffith as a manipulated southern lover and Bruce Willis (the most dangerous abortion in the director's chair.) Robert Altman may have breathed in and made these characters unpopular , But Brian de Palma, because of all his visual development, unprecedented in the nuances of the human experience.The resulting film looks good but seems blah to its inhumane theme in favor of prestige.Ofright, if the spelling does not make the viewer angry, what is the benefit ?
