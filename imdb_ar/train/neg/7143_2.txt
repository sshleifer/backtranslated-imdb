This film contains some of the most wonderful cars I have seen in a movie, and certainly the most hot women, but I must say that it is still one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is the plot, and if you read it with a little reflection, you will also have representation. <br /> <br /> At first, he brought characters, singing a hot woman (a clear sync of the lips). A music client or product comes along and thinks they are wonderfully demanding. She refuses, a lot of bad memories. Flash to hero war, back from war, has many battles, becomes a movie hero with a position that is better than everyone else. Get off in a strange quick car. Brothers racing, then die. Hero to avenge death, cut to get weapons from a friend. (You have not seen this friend before or after, but you seem to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this; yes really; I mean are you really sure? Yes, give me weapons; are you really sure; yes really; well, I think I can not talk to you, be careful, love you. <br /> <br /> Now he goes to blow up the house of his uncle who owned the car that his brother led. He finds a woman, decides to save her, starts off, and does not end up killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the film. Oh, yes, you have to throw one scene when bad people come to hit people who do not really care, but maybe add a little conspiracy. The race is not very exciting, of course it ends with two races for cars, and the other has to win the drums at the end of a sudden. <br /> <br /> Well, I've saved you only $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me, because I'd give you the same fun as this movie. Do not get me wrong, cars are fantastic, Nadia is beautiful, but she's really a terrible movie.
