I usually write reviews only for movies that I really hate or really love. As you can probably tell the number of stars there, I did not like it. Now, I suppose you read about the plot or maybe you saw the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's divide this, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: Concept: The hypothesis has been prepared to be interesting. The use of chaos theory was an interesting subject. However, it did not perform well. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that the theory of chaos was a kind of distortion. The event in the film seemed more like a fabricated coincidence than anything else. I think the butterfly effect was all represented by "God (s) causing a tsunami to restore the statue." The presentation comes really dirty though. Some people describe this with intelligence, but it seems to be another movement film. <br /> <br /> Story: Is this just me, or does it seem that Kamal threw this together to give him an excuse to play? Ten roles? The plot is very fabricated. Juvind has lost the flask many times in mysterious incidents (only happens to confuse his flask with a package he was sending to India, a crazy old lady who encounters a flask in one idol, half molded only for unexpectedly meeting at the same hospital, To mingle with one belonging to a famous singer.) <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh my God, CGI. It was worse than the special effects in Jaws 3, and those that suck. Immediately, I can figure out the moving parts. Even my 10-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look that way. <br /> <br /> Exciting works: Yes, now the scenes of motion in Tamil movies are unrealistic, but the thrills in this film were terrible and really distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I must admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought that Kamal would play people with similar skin colors, so the fake white men and the Japanese man Aikido surprised me. However, it was still so bad, I can easily determine who was wearing masks. <br /> <br /> Songs: Music has been distracting and ending anywhere in many situations. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character may have been the most disturbing in the film. They were loud, ditsy, and irrational about this idol. I found myself wishing I could die. <br /> <br /> Draw the holes and the logic of the refrigerator. Let me get this straight: The lab monkey was clever enough to cross a closed door with a password, but not smart enough to tell him the difference between a piece of chocolate and a bottle with a deadly virus. And then a former CIA agent, after it was found that the flask was heading to India. Instead of immediately following him, he married a polar dancer first. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer tests a small city hospital in the Third World when he can easily afford the best available medical treatment. In addition, he was shot in the throat with a bullet. You think he will kill, but instead, the magic bullet made it clear. I read this right and hit the tumor BULLET. <br /> <br /> Pros ... Naidu's character: Perhaps the only part of the movie's favorite is comedy.
