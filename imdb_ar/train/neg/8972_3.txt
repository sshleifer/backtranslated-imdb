<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this movie is, how can you shoot a cool porter and use only 3 of his 15 songs! Both merman and lahr played the main roles in Broadway, where they were replaced by the red skelton and the weaker Lucille ball. The plot changes and the fun is lost. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
