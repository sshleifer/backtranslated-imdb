It is likely that a man who was called was appended to irreparable damage to the floor of the cutting room. Maybe one of them will ask you to cut the output someday, but I strongly doubt that. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to take advantage of the Western Noodle Market and bring a large group of Americans to fill the cast. Outside. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Aquins, John Marley. Of course we have Vic Moro who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is always loved as a favorite because he is very good at playing. But he played seriously and did a good job in films such as Children's Clock and Venice. It could and break away from its normal typical course successfully. But a "man called a sledge" can not be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has won the title role as a "Luther Sladege" outlaw. After the killing of partner Tony Young at the Salon and Garner takes appropriate measures similar to Eastwood, followed by Salon John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in the nearby regional jail and appeared to be gold shipments placed under lock and key there in a break for people moving things over the normal term. Garner assembles his gang together to steal. <br /> <br /> Here the movie disappears completely from the wall. Films that steal heroes often appear to go into a lot of methodological planning. Certainly this was the case in The Wagon Wagon mentioned by some other reviewers. But in this decision, Garner decided to storm the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause the prison to break while the gold would be stolen. <br /> <br /> It was just a swallow. If getting gold is so easy, it should have been done a long time ago. But I will tell those who love the blood and courage of the Italians, during this prison, there is enough for three films. <br /> <br /> That's not all of it, of course outlaws and we have another Gore Festival before the film ends. But by that time, the entire film had lost a lot of cohesion. <br /> <br /> The best movie singer The Thirties Allan Jones is listed in credits. But for my life, I do not find it in the film. There may be a choir for Donkey Serenade that made it better. <br /> <br /> It could not have been hurt.
