The First Power (1990) was a terrible film that appeared during the late 1980s / 1990s of cheap horror films. I found this movie very boring but very joyous in some parts. This film lacks so much sense and credibility that it is not funny. The rapid justice system in this film makes Texas look weak compared to that. Le Diamond Phillips skips this role (playing a poached cop) and Tracy Griffiths (Melanie's most attractive sister) plays a psychological role. Do not waste your time with this because it's bad. What a minute, and brought back. This movie makes a great concert film. Check out a switchblade, which has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen in a nun who was not in the flick of Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This was the end of L.D.P. His star was smeared and he could not attract flies to a pile of dung. DTV was for him until his "climb" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
