I will try using words to describe this on .... <br /> <br /> I have seen the original version, which was good in its own way, but at that time I had to fear that sequel. <br /> <br /> I was scared when I picked up this, but now that I've seen it, I must say, it's worse, then I thought. Why these films still get the money still makes my mind spin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors; they are not very good, but it must be said that some run their role by being just awful. But what could the actor do with such a text? She is trying to be a copy of the original only this time as the places have changed, and any form of story and any attempt to reach something that has never happened before has failed miserably. In a futile attempt to modernize it, they try to make it exciting by taking advantage of the Big Brother, but this has been worn out for a long time and offers only filler between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by adding a lot of references to the original '83, but it ended up being funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you do not have anything, do not mean anything, do it ... go to watch it, or play Frisbee ... with DVD .... yourself. We will offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise you
