This is by far the worst film I have ever seen. I've seen some horrible movies in my time but these movies take the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It's so bad that I think a word to describe how you will feel after seeing these atrocities has not yet been created. Please just give yourself a favor, if you have any desire to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur, then multiply this vulnerability thirty times and you will still get a small fraction of the horror that you will store it on to. In short, I think you can really call it a horror film, but only if you're ready to feel scared by the worst of the work and a story that's absolutely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Scary
