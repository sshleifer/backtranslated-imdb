From the moment that Christopher Lee puts on sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've been stinky! This film was potential. Under all the sludge, the remains of what can be made in a decent film, if not an interesting film. The final product is a real mess, however. Apart from the unwarranted nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II concludes as a funny excuse for a horror film. Christopher Lee gives her a lot of credibility, but he can not even raise it above the level of waste. <br /> <br /> Since he has not seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will have to accept on his face the value that this is a true continuation of the events in the first part. We start at the funeral of one of the original characters, and during the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight a battle of wolves. The film is fairly good pace, and there are not many dead sites. Work there; it's not just a good shot. One bright spot is the music of a band called Babel. Although their song is often played, it is rather appealing. <br /> <br /> The problems of this movie are large. First, representation is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that is what ends. Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe lack everything they want for such characters. Writing is a miserable, redundant editing, amateur trend. There are tricks that have nice special effects, but the distant cheeses weigh them in the number. Siebel Daning is nice to look at, but her performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omn seems to be the role he plays, but his voice and his behavior are at least unconvincing. A large portion of the dialog box is in an incomprehensible language that may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I always enjoy the true stories of the faithful to fight the forces of evil that are invincible. One scene where a small group of good men roam in a dark forest and drop a bunch of wolves is a kind of excitement. Kind of. Perhaps it would have been more convincing to make a bigger budget or a better way out of the rest of the film. 3 of 10 stars Location. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Side note: As of this writing, the watchers on youtube.com have not succeeded in ending credits by Sybil Danning ripping off her head several times while Babel's song is playing! Take it when you can!
