<br /> <br /> The rest of the planet is inhabited by a few poor survivors who are starving. They must eat insects, insects, or anything, after the poisonous war, or anything, has wiped out almost human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people who are still able to live in comfort, we will call it "all big knowledge boss", has a great effort to prevent the release of some secret spores in the air. It seems that All Knowing Big Boss is the last person on earth to know that these germs exist. Spores are far from any living spirit, and are heavily protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The All Knowing Big Boss wants to keep the secret bacteria in its protected secret containers. Therefore, he devises a plan to send a muscular team to remove the spore containers from all the security systems and the secret location. Sending people to the location of secret bacteria makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to disable all the protection systems makes it possible to release germs easily into the air. What about letting sleeping dogs lie? <br /> <br /> The only good feature of ENCRYPT is Vivienne Woo. Because the members of the muscular team are unnoticeable with mechanically predictable timing, the fascination attraction of Vivian Wu makes the idea of ​​painting about the old employer wanting it so much. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very reasonable concept! <br /> <br /> Vivian Wu fans may want to check out a wonderful B movie that was there a few years ago called DINNER Speed. Dinner is highly recommended RUSH. Encryption is not.
