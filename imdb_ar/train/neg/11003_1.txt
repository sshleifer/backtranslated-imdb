How do I start? This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It does not have any redeemable qualities. I sat in this film and it was a struggle. I failed to get a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this terrible film. I felt that this film was a failed attempt at a horrible joke. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie is the soundtrack, and I'm sure that's why I wanted to watch this film in the first place. I will conclude this while I try to forget the time when I was only lost with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. You do not see this movie, it sucks.
