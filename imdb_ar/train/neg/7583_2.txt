David Lin's worst film. Even "in which we serve" was not as bad as this. Usually a movie that has a really good reputation like this movie, has at least some ransom qualities, making one understand why it can be considered classically. But after watching this, I could not understand why this piece of nonsense was so loved even in 1945! I did not like strong British attitudes, stories and writings (which may be very ingenious at times but not quite familiar) and soundtracks. Elvira's character is designed to be attractive and attractive, but she was actually ugly and had a strange and disturbing voice. Just another film convinced me not to trust the reputation of films. Another very overpriced "British classic".
