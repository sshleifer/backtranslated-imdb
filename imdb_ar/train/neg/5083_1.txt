I find it futile to comment on this "film" for the simple reason that he has nothing to comment on. It is like a rotten egg that has no justification for the world extracts for the fact that it is rotten as the last endless number of eggs before that. But because the commentary is mandatory for such gross negligence ... <br /> <br /> Filth is certainly the right word to describe this film, which was created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists on filming what is called "Roman reality" following the communist era (1990 to present days). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances is it recommended to people outside of Romania as to others (who recently found amateur camera, lack of plot, lack of quality for directors / actors, etc., noise etc. Being fashionable and even like art): View This is a "movie" and I enjoy it (as I know you will), but prefer other IMDb members of good will, do not write an online review because it will mislead and irritate and eventually waste its time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among other things) has some value at all, an educational film because it provides an example of: "How do not make a film."
