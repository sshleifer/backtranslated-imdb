I remember watching the BSG demo. I can describe that exact night. I remember what chair I sat in. This was a magic show. He came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year, and I saw every episode of the fourth year, with all sincerity and great hopes to be converted to some extent. Well, that did not happen. <br /> <br /> I have seen a Caprica pilot and I was grateful. There was hope for something good here. She then began to watch regular episodes and became more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It is very clear, and very predictable. It reminds me of the poignant political health of his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his work on the DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, he was good. This was particularly true early when they followed somewhat the pattern of loops developed by the first BSG series. When they left after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to fate. It was as if he had written the rest of the show without knowing where he would go. <br /> <br /> Maybe it gets better. Maybe just a few initial loops are weak. But I'm very nervous.
