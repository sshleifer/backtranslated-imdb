Skip the task: Galactica and watch live episodes of the original Legend instead. The network took parts 1 and 2 of the Living Legend and its intensity in one piece with the terrifying Fire In Space ring. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and little time to prepare for an appropriate production, the Living Legend is the best in the television series of 1978. Fire in space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical observation, see Galactica, the original Star Trek, then the Trek revival series, and you will see the difference in quality between the science fiction product across the network and the common science fiction.
