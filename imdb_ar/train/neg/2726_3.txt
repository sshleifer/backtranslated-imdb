Considering descent, this movie should be much more fun than it is. Even with a host of strange characters in the film - what do enthusiasts do not expect eagerly for a film that combines Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is going very well, and it is shot warmly, and most often, does not tire. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she continued to emphasize Kiss Me Stupid. James Stuart was a great comedy, where he was so aptly shown in films ranging from the Philadelphia story to Harvey. I think it comes out of this mess better than anyone else. Except maybe the cat.
