I was excited to watch this film after reading the book this week. My 13-year-old son was also looking at her. I hired him and infiltrated him to enjoy a classic holiday story that appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed, O boy. This movie has deviated from the book more times than is acceptable. George S. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this, he seemed to have been a complete figure in just about 20% of the time. The rest of the time was completely flat. <br /> <br /> I realized that this was done in 84, and the effects of pre-CG, most often. But it looked like the quality of B movies, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they ruled out one of the most exciting parts of the story: when the spirit of Christmas Christmas Scrooge took a tour around the world, watching people in the darkest conditions still enjoying Christmas light and love. <br /> <br /> I would like to admit that Mr. Scott has done a good job with his reformed "scoundrel in the end. Tim ... Do not even urge me to start representatives of bad children ...
