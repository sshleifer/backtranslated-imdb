I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it, but after watching it I was very disappointed. Slums are a completely strange film mixed with Todd Solondes' kind of disturbing family reality without Todd's commercial spirit. The story continues along and each scene is worse than the last. Perhaps I missed this point, but if this film is an example of every girl's experience growing up, I'm happy to be a man.
