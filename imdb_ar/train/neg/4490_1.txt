The man expects to take a movie with almost. The budget of US $ 300 million should at least enjoy the time spent in the cinema you actually see. The "Reload Matrix" proves this assumption error. <br /> <br /> "Matrix" worked better, although there were clear gaps with respect to the logic of the story. At least no one can explain to me why it will hit the robot (also known as the proxy) inside the simulation (aka Martix) to damage the computer program in any way responsible ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski Specifically this "understatement" is the main thing in "reloading the matrix": it's a great game. These fighting scenes may be sufficient (or even cold) in 5 seconds. Trailer, but for a long time to several minutes, it seems fake, poorly designed and repeated over and over again it is not more than boring. Despite seeing stunning stunts, there is nothing more than a simple, low-quality, non-imaginative bashing that has already been seen (or better), for example. Van Dam "movies". The post-production difference does not help here (the ether is 5 times faster, the camera floats around and freezes in some scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5 minutes). Not all this helps, all this has nothing to do with the same sense of "martial arts". Alongside these "battles", all representatives refuse to do what they are paid for: acting. <br /> <br /> What is the thing besides fighting scenes? Few exceptions are Hollywood routines. This multicultural group of hippies that have absorbed "Waterworld" as a citizen of "Zion" (the last man on earth) is recycled and at Morpheus's request they begin dancing, because this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered breasts and fagots. Clich√©s are popularly presented by the French-speaking frog who speaks with this idiotic accent "je ne sais quoi", whose wealth is wasted by "liason d'amour". After this (and funny junk) is fighting between Neo and the followers of the 'Frog' villain, because it occurs in Erroy Flynn like entertainment, fortunately featuring a lot of middle-aged weapons for decoration. For Neo posing with hellebarde, just add two stairs and lots of statues (to destroy, throw on the bad guys and the like) and you'll get 5 minutes more conscious and boring. Of this junk. <br /> <br /> What's left to expect? Hell is the usual promotion. And "revolutions" that will happen or not - certainly without me.
