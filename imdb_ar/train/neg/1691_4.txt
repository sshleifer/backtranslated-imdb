This film is not a real thing along with a series of series of armed and recognized serials interspersed with "I caught you!" At the end of each. Indeed, there is no evolution in character and no real plot to talk about. There is only more structural motivation for the characters to do anything while they advance to their inevitable pain. All this is just an excuse to show a creepy ghost child (who seems to have got some of the family cat mixed in his outer body) and his stealth mother (with long black hair hanging in her face like "The Ring") below a set of cardboard clips and a two- Of human characters. <br /> <br /> This English-language version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of unwanted filming; momentarily gratifying, but not really what it should be. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
