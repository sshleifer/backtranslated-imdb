S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs. It was very tight. Before and after this film strikes largely. Representation like the E list appears well in the film. Not to mention that it is a very low budget so that both Breishman and Charlie Charley play the same person. The entire film looks like it was filmed with a video camera instead of a decent half-way movie. The only other reason I liked in the film was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that, if you see this movie in Blockbuster then do anyone hiding behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated.
