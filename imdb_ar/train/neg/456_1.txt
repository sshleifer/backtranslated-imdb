Add to Cart: South Preacher and "The Community", The Flame Singer (Sophie Tucker?), The Dance Choir, Brothers Mills - It makes it worse. <br /> <br /> respectful nonsense for "Negro" performers, who often appear in films and make fun of themselves and their race. Although "Negro Comedy" was accepted in its day, it is very offensive today, and I doubt it was funny at all. Although I did not feel insulted, I do not think I had laughed at the weak attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, I may not have understood some of that.
