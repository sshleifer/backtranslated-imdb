It should not be a shock to you when I say that the movie Alone in the Dark is a crazy movie. To put it bluntly, it looks as though a monster of dung may stand out, eat the result, then vomit. The final product still outperforms this film. <br /> <br /> It seems that based on an ancient Atari video game (!), the movie has something to do with the gateway to the bowels of the earth, unleashing demons, and ancient civilizations. Something about two worlds, the world of darkness and the world of light. (Guess which one of us). Oh, and 10,000 years ago opened a civilization advanced super-deceptive gate, demons came and exploded, then wiped out civilization. That is why we have never heard of them, enough. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, possibly approaching the days of Heathers and pumping the volume, plays the role of Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher who had a bad thing when he was 10 years old. It's hot on the trail of one of the antiquities of the developed civilization mentioned. Carnaby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which tries to find out what happened to that ancient civilization. But Carnaby thought he would not be able to find the answers he asked, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But look, these monsters have come out, they get prey in different ways, such as holding them down, dividing them down the middle, planting their neural controllers, or turning them into zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's a distillation I can make. It's very twisted and incomprehensible. In similar films, one can see the daring researcher / adventurer discover things step by step, and when we are an audience with the researcher, it is very fun. But when the viewer turns from attack to attack without perspective or context ... not much fun. <br /> <br /> Representation is horribly acting, with the exception of Slater, who (although almost embarrassing in the film) has shown he can bear the burden of acting. It had to; get this - Tara Reed cast as a museum coordinator! Frankly to goodness, I thought I saw life when Dennis Richards was chosen as a nuclear physicist at Tomorrow Never Die. But Reed here corresponds to Richards, a passionate passionate crappy. Hightlights Reid, which announces "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land", and Reid offer most of its lines in an awesome monotonous monotony (like the kind of thing she would spend all night last week before filming), Reid - the curator of the museum, keep in mind - spend Much of the film is in short jeans and short trousers. Oh yeah, it was as reasonable as Jessica Simpson to give stock prices. Oh, why should you be pretty stupid too? (Note: I do not think Tara Reid looks beautiful, she seems to be in constant need of food). Everyone in the cast was completely oblivious, except perhaps Stephen Dorf, who played the role of Burke, one of the leaders of 713. The character of Dorf was not superbly developed, but there was nothing in the film, from groups to characters to Tara Reed. But I digress. <br /> <br /> In any case, the perplexing and perilous story is a story strong enough to follow a film that moves so fast, but director Owei Paul is shooting with devastating music. Loud You can not hear what actors say in some scenes! Can not be true. But given the level of representation, perhaps thanks to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and an enjoyable note. The opening moments of the movie include ... the words that are crawled across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? I heard that the subject of Star Wars is now fashionable as the introduction crept. Certainly there was no need to narrate. Why do I need some doofus to read what is on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking for the blind? This may also explain why the sound was so loud - they were also looking for people who were hearing impaired. Also, the narrator had a loss in the first few lines of crawling - and then lost. a stranger. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark is a loud mix filled with terrible effects and incoherent text and the output of pork. Barely memorize the rings correctly. There is so much chaos that the public simply abandons attention to the characters and roots of their rolls. Even in the dark, Satanic creatures look cooler and more sophisticated compared. <br /> <br /> Ironically, since there were only three people in the theater, I saw this alone in the dark. I wonder if Oy Paul had planned it this way? I can not give it the least estimate, because I have low hopes of starting it - and because it did not hold me enough to handle it. It is a terrible act, although Slater rephrases itself a bit.
