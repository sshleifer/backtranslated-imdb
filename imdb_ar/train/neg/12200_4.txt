Usually, any film with Sylvester Stallone usually absorbs the ass. Rambo: Blood The first part was no exception. The only films in which Sylvester Stallone was good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is unrealistic and boring. It has work, but not very good work. I did not enjoy seeing it, and I will not see it again. No wonder why she won the Razzie Award for worst pictures. I would give this 3/10, the only reason for getting it 3 is because it has a fairly good job, but not good enough.
