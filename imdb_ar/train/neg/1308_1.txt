The thing that really raises me about this film (which makes me feel physically ill) is that someone paid for it. There is absolutely no purpose to the existence of this film. It is not scary, does not think it provokes, it is not amusing, it is not good. It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. Comparing this DVD pack to B and Blair Witch, Eddie Dade, and some other decent films, making the director's desperation very clear. It is unlike any other film produced; it's far away, much worse. Allegations of "a terrible end will never forget" is equivalent to one ton of stinking horse droppings. Please do not waste your time watching this piece of garbage, as it may make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should be removed from the membership list of the writer's union and never allowed to shoot anything again. Because if he thinks this is a movie worth making, he may not have much to offer in the future. Stars zero. Grace may ruthless the soul of anyone who is unfortunate enough to see this. I'm going to go vomiting now.
