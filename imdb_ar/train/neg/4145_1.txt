Well, I've seen this movie twice now, I've searched it a lot on the Internet and asked many people about these views. I have even gone so far as to read the original film "Carmilla" by Sheridan Lafano, a book that is supposed to be based on this film. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe the game to play while watching it. Since the plot of the film does not seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Siberia with her father, Mr. de Lafontaine. They continue their lives in peace and peace. One day they get a message from the "General" man whose mission in life is to avenge the death of his daughters. He claims to have supernatural powers at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. In the meantime, chance of chance with a strange woman leads to Lavontine sponsoring her daughter Carmela for months. Laura soon begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to descend into a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmella? And what to do with the case of Laura, the general? <br /> <br /> I have invented this game and wish as many people as possible to play it, let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and I'll have a jingle as well, but I can not bother it. Named the game "This film makes no sense." <br /> <br /> All you have to do is watch the movie, try a complete plot to explain what's going on. I mean complete, all the questions were answered, everything logical, completely completed. <br /> <br /> Will he have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires navigate the day light? <br /> <br /> Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> Why is the girl called Bob? Why do they shoot themselves? <br /> <br /> * When is a movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> Why does zombie killing seem to be an acceptable part of life that makes no one a bat dry? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine discover and break a coma without slowing down as he drives his car, but when confronted with a woman with a clear hostage at the back of her excuse she is also coma? <br /> <br /> Why did the girl, who later publicly revealed that he knew she was a vampire in the head, drive him in his car? <br /> <br /> * Then let her go, with her daughter alone in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the asylum scene about? <br /> <br /> What is the green hell about? <br /> <br /> Why do vampires suddenly start to get dressed like a nurse? <br /> <br /> Why is there no vampire fighting ever zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the importance of the necklace? What is it made of? Why kill vampires? How do you know "Jenna" it? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's great fun to try and ask a lot of questions about this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I have a conspiracy, and I have to admit that it's not quite there, but it's a good effort. <br /> <br /> In the summary <br /> <br /> "Vampires vs Zombies" have no moment in them where there are actually vampires fighting zombies. It seems that everyone in the film knows exactly what is going on, yet it seems very reluctant to let the public get into this. In some way based on a classic 19th-century horror novel. What? why? What the hell is going on?
