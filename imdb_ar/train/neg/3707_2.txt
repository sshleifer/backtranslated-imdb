This may be the worst film I've ever seen, (yes it's worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any Kevin Costner movie). <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this film, and his supportive actors do not seem to be They were trying to act. Chris Rock is a fantastic comedian, but he can not transfer his talent to this film, which is likely to have two tense victims in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, avoid it like a plague. Do something constructive and more interesting like watching a weather channel or watching the paint dry on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give it 2/10! <br /> <br />
