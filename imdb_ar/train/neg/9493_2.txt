This hilarious "Hippie Mindset" in the 1970s, in the walnut case, fills us with this process. Trying to rationalize ridiculous marriages of young and innocent women with elderly sex demons and washing. Hippy is a naive young man played by Wa Len, who looks like a wif and starts off and sleeps with all the bad guys. Then she meets an ironic day (Holden), already at an early age, drinking hard liquor, washing her as an actress and deciding she is "in love" with him. If you think this is superficial, the entire film will wrap these scenes. She continues to say how much you "love" him and only meet him. He dresses quickly and quickly. I could only laugh throughout the film. Obviously they are only used as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to believe that we will buy that there is already no love. The disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, and I had to give it quickly because it inspired me to vomit. The film also features a horny performance of music from the 1970s. Avoid this if you can. Grade d.
