Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winston) has a criminal past, has problems with alcohol and makes up Now the drugs usually make him paranoid and prone to domestic violence for his wife Valerie (Cathy Burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming out like a mop. At the same time, her mother Janet (Leila Morse) is familiar with Ben Ray, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating habit of drugs being driven out of bars. The film follows these characters as they tear them apart. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to enjoy misery, and this will include watching the movies you enjoy in this way. Movies like Nil by Mouth feature this. It's the story of a broken family, torn by crime, poverty, alcohol, and drugs, the kind that Jeremy Kyle will have as a three-course meal. It is also the story of self-destructive men, three generations apart, each copying the other, rupturing the family, and trying to keep them together, though not strong enough. If you've picked up a little bit of spin around, you can see that it's not worth watching the cheerful show from the start and it certainly does not disappoint this. <br /> <br /> It's true that what everyone has said about shows, and prominent stars, Winston and Burke, are doing some great acting. Winston loses her with his wife, hits her senseless after some paranoia caused by coke, breaks down during a telephone conversation with her and unleashes a typical arsenal of the words f and c when she refuses to let him see his child. Similarly, at a special moment, we see Burke skilfully losing her composure on the stairs, the full effect of the night before the start of the game. <br /> <br /> This is another film of those films where there is no "plot" to follow, as such, just a real sense of this desperate life that lasts from day to day. It has been acclaimed by many (including Baftas!) But it was really very bleak and grim for me. I have no right to criticize this and know what I know about it outside of clearing, but unfortunately this is how I found it. **
