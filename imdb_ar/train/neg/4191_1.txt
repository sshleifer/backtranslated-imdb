I've seen a lot of decadent horror in my time, all very bad, but nothing up to the depths that this piece of garbage is cutting. This film made me more angry and angry as I watched him try to get my head around what this movie was about. Now that I've seen him, I understand - to a certain extent - what happened and why, but the film itself is so confusing that it is not fun to watch. Yes, there are the usual scenes of unwarranted violence, and the extremists who show the insight of their exciting characters ("The highway belongs to me ...!"), Enough nudity distracts us from the "conspiracy", but you still have to leave this movie alone It benefits, like a puppy is no longer required and leaves in a roadside box.
