Gods ... where to start. I could only endure in the first ten minutes before putting it out in disgust. Apart from the actor who plays Robin Hood himself, the rest was just terrible. I can only comment on the suspension of non-ratification so far. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the first episode, I have lost the number of errors, plot loops and terrible fashion that have occurred there. It started with some poor peasants trying to find deer to feed his family. Everything is good and good. However, the poorest person must be deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armor, on horseback, managed to sneak into him about 10 feet away. <br /> <br /> Then, as he runs away, he goes behind them 10 feet behind him, into a shot where you can not see them at all, then immediately recite them about 20 feet behind him again. Then he runs in some of the bush, and is run by two soldiers ... who were just seconds away, running on horseback, a dozen feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The soldiers are painfully cloths and obviously they tried to make them look like miles, and they failed miserably. Not to mention that the armor of the main soldier is about 5 sizes large for the poor companion. Seriously, he looks like a little boy wearing his father's huge armor! Finally, Robin is able to launch about 5 shots, ideally guided around one soldier's hand, in about two seconds, from what appears to be a recurve arc. No one can make these kinds of shots, in this short period of time, with a rifle with a range, much less than a bow. <br /> <br /> The "Falah" is digging a ditch ... something that all nobles were willing to do all the time, right? How sorry this excuse for the series I ever got the second season is out of my mind. Production costs (at least for what I've seen) should have gone up by tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think a high school drama break could have done better. This was so bad, even that the terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was the best. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that you go beyond this monster and go to rent or buy the Robin Sherwood series in the mid-1980s. Much better than writing, acting, fashion and production. <br /> <br /> For shame, the BBC ... for shame ...
