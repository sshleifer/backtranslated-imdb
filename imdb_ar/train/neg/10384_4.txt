.. That's it! Very fantastic hypothesis, straight away from the bat. <br /> <br /> Having an excellent first scene, you must be credited when the balance is due. <br /> <br /> He has solid characters and texts decent enough for a hidden story but here are the things that bothered me: whenever ghosts appeared, I really loved her by the way; how it was, how it looked ... the only thing is the relationship of the ghosts. Because of how things go in the first scene, you think their dynamics will be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed a bit in the middle, and I felt crab / spider just not good. But the end is actually very good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically talked about the same story through a polished lens but not samurai and that's what I liked in this film relative. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a temperament is making this movie again. <br /> <br /> The fans of "Silent Rage" love this movie perfectly.
