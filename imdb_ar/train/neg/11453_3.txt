This is one of the worst comedy films I have ever seen. I hate this tear Napoleon Dynamite. Only experienced people have mastered the already dumb humor. Make something new once. All these new comics are just awesome. And out of the SNL Andy Samberg is not ready to take a leading role so far. I hope he can recoil from this terrible film. The Arnettes character is very bad. Hey woe, did you read the script. The plot is really the worst written ever. Now you tell me if this is strange. (This is the film) Frank Rod's father dies from Rod Kimbel and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rudd plans to make this huge jump to raise funds for Frank's benefit. Only so that Rod could overcome Frank in the fight and prove his manhood. Yes, this movie, as you tell me, will spend $ 7.00 to watch this piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 Just Awesome <br /> <br />
