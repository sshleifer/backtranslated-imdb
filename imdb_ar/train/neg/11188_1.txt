This is the worst film I have ever seen. Start. interval. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this feces steaming film. A very boring scenario, lousy behavior, awesome, often incoherent and many scenes that do not seem to have anything to do with the gross film (such as when the partner Heath Ledger is nailed to the wall by a ghost ... What is the point in this scene? On a postcard please ...) <br /> <br /> I had to get a medal to stick to this movie throughout the show. Best kick a strong thigh instead of sitting in this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be at the bottom of 100 IMDb. We hope that my vote will help 1/10 on his way.
