I did not expect much going to this, but still came out disappointed. This was the least production I have in Halestorm that I have seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I just ridiculed 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat man eating cakes and falling over and over again? What was it with the guard in the sky scene? Farid Willard Farhana was with some of his collaborations with Christopher Just, but that did not work. They must have spent the whole budget on the appearance of "well-known" representatives in this because there was no budget for lighting. Apparently he was filmed with a video camera and most of the scenes were too dark. Does it really take a lot of movies to show someone actually shooting and making a basket, instead of cutting the ball and releasing it through a basket? I do not try to be too critical in low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.
