This movie takes what could be a good idea, a 2,000-year-old witch stuffed and completely destroyed. Nora and Jim addicted to alcohol go to Ireland to dry. They go to stay with her Nan and his uncle. A 2,000-year-old witch discovered in peat was discovered. He greets her and takes the shape of a light. They can not be killed traditionally, (more compassion). Nora, however, is working on finding a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely cheap Goth horror film. It is a vast mess. I have to ask why anyone wants to make such a bad film. I feel tempted to learn magic to hide it. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs
