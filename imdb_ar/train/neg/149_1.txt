Well, you know the rest! This should be the worst film I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Biham has some bills to pay when she plays this role. <br /> <br /> The leading role (to me) is completely unknown and I imagine that it disappeared again into mystery immediately after this Turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led martial arts in the early 1970s, and since then fighting scenes must have been either martial arts or at least savage if street fighting techniques are used. This movie uses quick extracts to show martial arts, but even this can not hide the fact that the lady does not know how to punch. There was an 8-year-old boy who separated her in this show. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery here is how he did not win this golden berry for his year.
