I really wanted to like this film because the critics were inappropriate. It was (to say the least) ... but it was terrible. Really bad-tempered <br /> <br /> Done, an unwise, low-key scenario ... I watched watching this movie <br /> <br /> Like watching a car crash - you want to look away but you still You stare <br /> <br /> because you want to see how messy you will get. Well, the car is broken <br /> <br /> There are no survivors. On the positive side, the film industry was nice <br /> <br /> and made me want to go for a holiday, if it was just to cleanse myself from <br /> <br /> This is not holy
