As a silent film lover, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, it seems that the film was very long and long for Maxwell's car. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene was half its length, I enjoyed the movie more. But it got very quickly. And while I realize that reality goes on many times in films, without diminishing the fun of the viewer, what was with the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car across the mountains, a car that drives most of the time at about one mile an hour, but they can not catch up with it?
