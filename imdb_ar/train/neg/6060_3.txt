There is this girl working in the woods but she ends up in this woman's clinic and wants an abortion. Her father is outside in a car and is angry at it. The entire incident occurs both inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really supportive of choice but I wanted to choose to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the baby come out and went in the corner. The part where they were doing ultrasound was very, very funny. I really feel sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I did not really blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him in the end or what happened to the father and his other daughter in the waiting room. I was just laughing hard and I suggest watching "pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode but it was not great.
