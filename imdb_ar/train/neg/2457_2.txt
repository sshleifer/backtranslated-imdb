Some people do not like animation. Personally, I think the animation was very impressive when the film was made. There are a lot of old cartoons that I just love. My problems with this film are not animations, but basically the way they were built. The characters are all just ... well, clumsy. For this film, they should not be. Apparently, everyone in the LOTR has a labyrinth problem (for starters.) Just the way they acted in general bothered me. My sister and sister were laughing through most of this film. I think if many people see this before seeing the latest, they will not have gone. I'm glad I rented this and did not buy it. There are a few films that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst film I have ever seen, although it ranks first in it. Or there, depending on your point of view.
