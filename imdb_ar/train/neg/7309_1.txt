I have rented and watched this movie for the first time on a DVD without reading any comments about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed something wrong in this film; it's terrible! I mean in the trailers it looked scary and dangerous! <br /> <br /> I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film are stupid, the film would be funny ... (very stupid, it's funny ...? wrong!) He must Watching and learning from the best comedy films such as "Night of Fear", "Lost Boys" and "Return of the Living Dead"! This is funny! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is why I signed up at www.IMDb.com so I can launch my thoughts about discontent about it. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie again> AAARGH! <And write notes about my partial "review" to show how stupid the film is. "Resident Evil" (Horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Comedy) I can watch again and again and still enjoy it! but this ...! <br /> <br /> How far can the script be and the output ??? So bad. In the early scenes, we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog is lying on the ground with his tongue suspended from his mouth and his dead glass is dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about the blond, long-haired boy who bites people. <br /> <br /> My answer to an unanswered Marcy question ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing." The text states that the bearded man warns them of the forest simply for "suspense". <br /> <br /> Then, the "smartest" in the five package, Bert, gives us almost an example of how forest fires begin. Henry meets the injured now who asks for help and here in the film wants to break the record in the use of "F-word". Bert begins with fear because Henry seems ill. Burt: "Do not make me shoot you!" (Forget to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert is back in the cabin but what about it? Meet Marcie and Jeff who had sex, but now suddenly decided to go out for a walk! Mursy comes out with the wisdom of the campfire, which was not guarded and which Burt had earlier begun (the moment of clarity for change?). Burt did not mention Henry because he was believed to have killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, while five Estupidos sit around their fire, another strange appears with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the forest is about - it's full of strange roles ... and their dogs!) They let him sit with them just because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely poisoned! No wonder why they are all stupid!) This is the last time we'll see this forgotten character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in his cabin, (note: he was lying all the time a few meters from his cabin !!!) It looks worse, almost coma, covered with a machine! He says he needs a doctor. But young Einstein refuses to help the poor sucker. It enters the closed truck and has its ignition key. Henry seems smart enough to push the hell away from there, but instead starts pumping blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five comes out, armed with: a BB gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* hah? Have already tried playing baseball in the middle of the forest ???), poker, spray (pesticides?) Can, ready to fight one man, Armed and terrible disease. (Intelligent scenario!) Burt managed to kill the car with one shot from BB Gun, which is possible only in the mind of director Elie Roth. "What should I do?" Burt screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to hit Henry with their kettles and poker, but they avoid the windows and crash the truck. Henry goes to the stupid girls who say, "He's coming for us!" (Thank you for the information, you idiots, I can see it! But I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy squirts in his eyes, making Henry cry! And "our hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning record of camp fire, which they left recklessly while burning inside the cabin! (Where did all this wisdom disappear? I think cannabis has begun to influence!) :-) Henry turns into a human torch and runs away, screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Burt and Jeff went out for a mechanic. Marcy decides to "go for help" herself, in the woods, where Paul remains with Karen ... Does not this look stupid? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "seeking help"! <br /> <br /> I have now skipped my comments on how we suddenly saw Marcy in a boat that ran over a huge winding river! How did you get a boat? Do you even know where to go? Anyway, she goes to the river bank and finds a very large and deserted cabin, and as in most horror movies, she walks inside the cabin saying, "Hello, is there anyone?" Burt suddenly emerges from behind the furniture and frightens her (I am at the beginning). Jeff comes as well. How did they get here !? Do they swim across the river ?? Do you see how the script is not mindless !? <br /> <br /> Winston Paul's deputy meets in the cabin. He somehow does not notice the blood on their truck. This happens about 35 minutes from the show and I decided to stop torturing myself afterwards and turned off the DVD. (Before I take my eyes out! Now, that's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do it for you and see "Fright Night" or "The Lost Boys" . Then you'll see they are more entertaining than this ... thing. Even "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a lousy film, is more entertaining than "Cabin Fever".
