In my opinion this film advances any new thought. It seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking at the side! The director seems to have an agenda! Doh! I find that his mentality lacks that there does not seem to be room for alternative opinion. I am usually on the side of the rejecter but this film lacks credibility because it depends on the wonderful observations of the man / woman on the street. Now if you want to have a reliable alternative to a doctrine that has been adhered to for over 2000 years, you have to do more to allow the other side to express its beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film, I felt like I was an assault on the Christian faith. I'm an unbeliever, but I allow the beliefs of others, and I will not wish to make fun of them.
