*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From the very opening credits, this wonderful film records the right record: it is an instant classic film. It does not take long to realize that this is a big movie, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Police 7." I left her speechless silent bone as I walked out of the movie theater and went straight to the ticket table to buy myself dozens of other tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that requires multiple scenes. The first viewing will certainly leave you with that huh? Feeling, but do not feel embarrassed - happens to the best of us. The story is so clever that one wonders about the death of its authors. What seems like a simple story about an idiot sneaks into the FBI, turns into a metaphorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. You will be confused by the complexity of the Earth's structure at first sight, but do not give up! I did not start revealing some of the hidden puzzles of "Corky Romano" until before the sixth or seventh watch. Watch out for the unexpected change in the end. Otherwise, you may be quite alert when FBI agent Brick Davis is found to be the FBI's most wanted criminal. Corky is not a real agent in the FBI, Pops Romano is innocent, and Peter Romano admits that he is Mom, Romano comes out of the closet like a sexual actor. I was surprised by the hell, I can tell you a lot. <br /> <br /> The unique talents of Chris Katan are unparalleled as he leads his character as a Romano cork through a maze of unpredictable positions at all. Reminds us of John Reynolds' performance in "Manos, The Hands of Destiny," which takes countless characters and addresses all the scenes in a perfect comic time. However, Katan is not just about comedy. He is also the master of drama, controlling the audience's feelings with the slightest movement of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in some way. For example, in the scene where he distanced himself from the faces of his brothers, you can see an expression of social injustice and alienation reflected clearly on his tortured face. In such a situation, it is difficult to find a dry eye at home. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriters David Garrett and Jason Ward are the true heroes of "Corky Romano". With a story of these proportions, it is easy to understand why it was necessary to hire two experienced writers to complete this ambitious project. The story-telling and unconventional structure makes the "core of the imagination" seem like a satirical play on Saturday night. The story of Garrett Ward is so attractive and attractive that you grab your hair, swallow you up, shake you, and spit you right away. At the end of the experience of the outside world known as "Corky Romano", you find yourself a different person with different world views and different ideas, with only one question thinking: <br /> <br /> Why, God? why?!?
