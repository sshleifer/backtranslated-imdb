My wife and I thought that this was a thinly tailored version of the Manhattan Murder Mystery TV ... which in itself is good, but not fantastic. The story contains little tension or chemistry, not much of the plot. Personality Woody Allen is just a person walking around running at the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson do not have much to do. It is very disappointing, I must say. The role of Ian MacShane is simply the appearance of an extended veil. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay to Woody Allen for his removal from Manhattan?" He must be in need of money and must be in need of his appeal to expand his audience beyond the two-star youth market. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it's a bad back noise. If you want to get something while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, you will. I will not pay to rent it again.
