When evaluating documentary films that focus on a relatively small group of ugly far right groups and conservative groups like this in the United States, consider the following. The United States of America, with a population of 270 million and its complex history as a democratic, aspiring State, hopes and desires to defend human rights, has its own shortcomings and shortcomings. Of course, the presence of extreme right-wing groups and militant groups is expected in large numbers, but for the size of its population it is small and isolated. On a per capita basis, in Europe, Britain, and even Australia there are actually similar right-wing groups on the basis of per capita share of the actual size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia higher than in the United States. For the reasons mentioned above, it is unjustified to humiliate and humiliate the American people and the level of their discussion in educated American society by presenting a group of these extremist extremists by fraud and extreme deception as representing American society. By doing so, Greenstreet selected small, deliberately isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to build a picture of America as an intriguing and intriguing lie. This film is clearly designed to ignite the views of people who harbor this subconscious and sick and hate the American people and way of life under the guise of the familiar leftist ideology. This film was produced for profit, not to promote the truth about American society and the humanitarian condition. Greenstreet can make documentary films that focus on far-right plots, the military-industrial complex, but fail miserably to provide a realistic and balanced debate, let alone alternative solutions to the failure of vibrant democracy. View the movie as Anti American by supporting this trash. Sensory in its worst anti-US garbage.
