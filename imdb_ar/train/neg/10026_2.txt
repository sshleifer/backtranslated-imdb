I had some anticipation for the film, because it had a wonderful star, the return of Dai Akshay and Saif. Well, I was reluctant to watch the film because it was done by the same guy who wrote the Dhoom franchise story because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Chuan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the credits, I was satisfied because they were put up in a nice way. Well, the first scene itself pis * took me out. Then, the main drawback to the film is the sequence of motion. My friends and I were laughing with the courage of watching these crappy battles. It was like Akshay against about 30 thugs and all the thugs even got the machine guns! Phew ... You have to see this to understand how bad the sequence of events is. <br /> <br /> The other thing in the film is the story that is highly predictable. That reminded me of some early 80s movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing the film deserves is the dramatic Kareena that looked hot in this film. 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Hey guys, please .. please ... do not see this one thinks it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch it to laugh at terrible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> That's it.
