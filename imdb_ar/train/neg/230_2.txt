This was awful. Andy McDowell is an awful actress. Wooden makes it a rocking horse look like it can do a better job. But remember that this turn in four weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film depicts England as full of chocolate bags and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools except Hogwarts might look like this? The twee police station looked like a collection of Heartbeat (a British series of nausea in the 1960s). This film could not decide what it wanted to be - a comedy or a serious study of secret currents in women's friendships. If previously stuck, the scenes of sexual tombs and the very stupid storm of the wedding may have worked (I say only). But those scenes did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it unreasonable that Kate talks to Molly again after her terrible behavior. A final note - what does a nice actress like Staunton do in this pile of feces? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell must adhere to wrinkle cream advertising.
