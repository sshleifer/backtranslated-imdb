"Houseboat Horror" is often considered the worst Australian film to be produced, describing it as a typical feature film, which carried the promotional film "Watch the Oscar-winning movie." Death by burning mania as they tried to shoot a music video on a remote lake in remote Australia. The flick effect is written and written without any suspense and annoying characters. The larynx is cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like bright sinister movies, you can try this experiment, but you've been warned. At least the best of Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
