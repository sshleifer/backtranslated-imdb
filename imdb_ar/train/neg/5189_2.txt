It was better for this series to have done one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Symbol Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. The Diamond Head character needs someone who can handle the role of the beloved rogue, which McShane has proven he can do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond chairman, is really only in this role. McShane is not really as good as a bad guy's tree. The character of France Nuyen, Tso-Tsing, does not seem to decide whether she is the wretched victim or the cruel woman who is ready to fight. She finally got her pay when she was forced to play Diamond Head. After watching one or two episodes, I ended up not paying attention to what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate, but the diamond head does not give us anything to like. Unfortunately, this kind of espionage in the 1970s was not exactly as it was in the 1960s.
