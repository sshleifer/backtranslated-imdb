A police officer (Robert Forster) in a crime-ridden city was attacked by his wife and her youngest son was killed after daring to stand in front of a killer in a petrol station. After the murderers of the corrupt judge go off with the corrupt judge and imprison him for 30 days for contempt of court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of guards led by Fred Fred Williamson. These Robin Hood types categorize any criminal that the law does not want to prosecute, and by helping them track those who offended him. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a big bag. The only unusual thing is the slaughter of a two-year-old boy on the screen and was somewhat ill. Otherwise, the usual business of this type, for example, involves a lot of car chases, beatings and mixed shooting with lots of masculine attitudes. I could have done it without going into the prison battle in the bathroom with all those naked prisoners. Also, did you run out of money before filming the last scenes? I remember this because it ends up very abruptly with little closure. If anyone knows, give me a jerk .. In fact, do not bother. <br /> <br /> To conclude: a file under the heading "Forgettable Nonsense". next one..
