The "Scream of the Skull" opens with a warning and offer free burial services if you have to die watching it - now there is a problem! The story itself has a rather interesting idea about the horror flick: The kidnapped couple marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is mad with loud noise, mysterious roads and skulls that appear at inappropriate times. Add to the gardener version sufficiently creepy and still cherishes the memory of the wife of the first man he dedicated. Perhaps in the 1950s it was not the technology to pull some of the horrific scenes needed to fill this film, and the techniques used here seem to be fabricated and mundane. But again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" at the age of nine, this kind of hippie gave me my pocket in the same way I'm sure this film was presented to young viewers of the same right. <br /> Do not get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it seems to have become boring at times. But there is some tension in the atmosphere at Whitlock's large but generally uncluttered house, the gardens and swimming pool are a nice touch. For me, the best scene was played by Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) as he goes obsessed in the pool trying to retrieve the hidden skull, walking around the wardrobe completely, in a neat contrast to the mentally disabled gardener (director Alex Nicole in a binary game). It makes you wonder who was the real dimmer. <br /> <br /> In his own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing in the film is: What about this road the elegant bridge that Whitlock made in his first appearance - the doors of the Nawras Pavilion in 1958! This at least made me jump from my seat!
