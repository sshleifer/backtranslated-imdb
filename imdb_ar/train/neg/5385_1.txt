I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have not done anything before or since. Scott Debralee is listed in the cover boxes, but does not appear in the film at all. Writing is very bad, even for college films. Obviously it is a very low budget, with a single scene in the house of our organization that has a very fickle editorial. <br /> <br /> The characters are very typical for college movies - shy man, nerd, shiny black man, hard guy, man with mustache, attractive girl, little girl in town, etc. The special teacher is about what you expect ... A middle-aged man who is a heavyweight man easily steps down. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see a college flick, keep clear of this one. It's very bad, it's not funny.
