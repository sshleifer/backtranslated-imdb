This is a real bomb. We should think that Merle Uberon is the broken daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom Delay in the 1930s that he deserves support as a presidential candidate. The Merle poor can not go anywhere, but are surrounded by politicians and crush them and crush their wives and support only by his uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids at a blind date and Gary Cooper happens. Some of the shots Rodeo might have stimulated things, an "incompetent" game, but no luck. Gary wakes up later at a formal gala dinner, chaired by Merle, and despite being invited to sit down and join the group, he reads them a lecture about their kidnapping. Where did the sudden cowboy rhetoric come from? The most surprising scene in the film is a fictional play by Gary at his unfinished home for his absent wife, Merle. will never end? One to avoid.
