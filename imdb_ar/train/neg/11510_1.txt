Not my fault. My friend made me watch her. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this film. There was for many years the idea that Madonna could act but she could not. There has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director but he only mediates. Awkwardness of every round. <br /> <br />
