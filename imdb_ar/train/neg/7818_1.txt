I usually do not go out of a movie, but I did it halfway. This film promised something different, but I kept thinking do not you see it before? Spoiler alert! Back in 1, the spacecraft crashed and landed on the ground, well, all these years after, with an adult on board, this thing is still able to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization can not seem to develop landing gear? For an industry that is liberal, we can see another film by Woody Allen, not blacks please! Superman runs around saving people, making sure he sticks to Europe and the United States, and does not go into the dark areas please. Maybe I could have borne this 30 years ago, but now.
