Great disappointment. This was one of the best dramas / detective shows in the UK from the 1990s that developed the brilliant title character played by Robbie Coltran of Scotland. However, this one time has nothing to add and may suffer from inevitable forgetfulness due to increased expectations when the preferred show returns after a long pause. Coltran is not given much to do, and he pays more attention to the killer who does not care, and in what he does, he seems uninvolved and bored. The story of the former soldier was written through the books and our attempt to update the life of the Coltran family seemed light. Perhaps if the book had a whole series in front of them rather than a two-hour presentation, they would have written it more deeply. As it is, I skipped this and saw the old Cracker of the 1990s which is much better.
