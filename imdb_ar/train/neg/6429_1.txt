Personally I would advise people to stay away from this movie. On the whole, it should be noted that the fighting is poorly designed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD version of this movie, the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But anyway, since when was a Ninja movie worth watching. I can not think of one and I do not want it frankly. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have one golden rule: avoid any movies containing the word "Ninja".
