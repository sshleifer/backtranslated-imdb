Jennifer Jason Lee and Mary Winningham are a good match for two very different siblings, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or essential to her role. Lee, who plays the role of a leading band singer and Sally Floyd, tends to go to the older sister of Georgia, popular singer Johnny Mitchell. Perhaps because of her dual duties as a co-producer in the film, Lee seems to have stuck herself in a corner: she's not credible as a singer, and even if that's intentional, she gives her a very long time on screen in a microphone. Leigh may hope to pull out his driving force, which is a wire, nervous, and fearful plot; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (obviously I have a strong representative, but she makes decisions here that prevent us). If Sadie has got the least amount of charisma or appeal, we may be able to buy the idea that she is getting the (small) breaks she makes. As it is, the prospect of waking up on stage is weak. The director Olo Grosbard makes some dramatic dramas, and the editing at the end of the show leads to a sadistic bar performance with the sold-in scene in Georgia - both singing the same song - it's a sad moment ... But what really is a point? * 1/2 of ****
