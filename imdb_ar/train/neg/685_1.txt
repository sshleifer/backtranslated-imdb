My wife and I thought that with this actor and director, the film should be worth watching at least. We were wrong. In fact, I gave up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young, and Tone were British but spoke in American dialects was impossible for me to go through - it's hard to believe that this is England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly announce their love to each other for no reason is ironic. There is no reason to pay attention to any of the characters, which is why we threw the towel halfway. I found it hard to believe that Hawks had directed this, as none of the representatives spoke with the Hawksian rat-a-tat brand. So save your time, skip this one.
