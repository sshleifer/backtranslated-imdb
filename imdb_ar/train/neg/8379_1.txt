Like some of the other reviewers I've mentioned before, I'd like to know what the moron actually reads the text and go, "Yes, that's it, this is the next movie where we'll go to the green light !!" Whatever this person, his head should be checked to see the actual brain activity. Because anyone who is responsible for collecting money actually has to get this after reading the script, well, I would like to give you my email address and maybe want to give up some money. This movie is terrible in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are funny, at least it can be. They made some good movies and they had some incredibly funny performances along the way. But here, the assumption is not only to defy logic, not only the terrible representation, not just the entire film attack from start to finish, not only the direction you can find amateur, but they really want you to pay to see this film. Maybe if it were free ... Nah, it would be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Usually I tend to write some lengthy detailed comments about why this movie is bad, but just enough to say that let me briefly talk. This is the lowest film we have ever seen, which is just as weird as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. Prepare the top ten list of the worst films of all time!
