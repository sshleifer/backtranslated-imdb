Mercury is usually used and never bothered me before - I liked "Bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo-science or I play inference. The whole film is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and witchcraft. I do not oppose magicians, I loved "curry" (novel and film) but this one bothered me. I think it is because of the main personal developing esp of the electric line. The professor spends his time studying special cases. I was not alive in the 1960s to know whether esp was a fallacy at the time or not, but I suppose any such theory would simply be credible. What really bothered me was how the police described schizophrenic patients as ruthless, unpredictable, and could appear as ordinary people 99% of the time and then attracted only. Nothing could be further from the truth. I hate such concepts because they add to public crap. Many people still believe that schizophrenia is a separatist identity disorder. Anyone who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts for the film. I liked the way the men's witch used it; it was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but did not do when she was around her forced lovers. I found it interesting how her second lover burned his face too. If the script is touched several weeks before production and has not focused only on making its audience more stupid, it may be a good film.
