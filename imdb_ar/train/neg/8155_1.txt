I actually prefer Robin Williams in his most serious roles (like Good Good Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to Garp). This is my favorite Robin Williams movies. But Seize the Day, despite its good performance, is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and certainly the worst of the movie "Robin Williams" (worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). Every good story will have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is one giant down. I do not need the Hollywood Cheese Festival, but I have to get something other than 90 minutes of complete despair and talk. This film reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point in the film is knowing how much one person has fallen. the answer? who cares.
