Good night, Mr. Tom starts in a wonderful village in southern England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of ​​the period when we hear a radio announcement about the declaration of World War II. Soon after, a train blows up a drawing of refugee children from London, and when the shy little William is dropped with the old idle dead Tom (whom you know will completely turn into a heart of gold) our story begins. <br /> <br /> What a load of emotional claptrap is. In fact it's just an old version of the strange couple. Do not write any new stories? <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, there is hardly any feeling in the village and there is not much in London apart from the strange old ambulance. There is certainly no hint of the Blitz's horror as Londoners politely approach the air raid shelters. Even when the husband of the local school teacher who is supposed to have been killed is reported to have been killed, he was later returned to life. <br /> <br /> I found that "Goodnight, Mister Tom" was vulgar and clear, and John Thaw's tone conjured Ronnie Parker's image of Roniz with a straw in his mouth as he chanted "Country of Pumpkin." By the way, my wife enjoyed this film for all the reasons she hated me and looked at his fellow reviewers, and I seem to be in one minority. <br /> <br />
