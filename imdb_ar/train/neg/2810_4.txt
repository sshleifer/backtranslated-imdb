I am surprised by the many female voters who gave this film better marks. I thought in this film that the target audience is adult and male. Women who suffer from skin, torture, merciless retribution and a large number of the body are typical components introduced in the history of films by sub-spaghetti. Conquest and hand break are two DJANGO fires. However, The SHOOTER lacks a style like the Jango. The result, acting and cinematography are modest at best but if you're looking for the ingredients above, you're in the right place here. The representatives have no Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
