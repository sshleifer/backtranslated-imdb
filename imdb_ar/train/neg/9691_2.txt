This is a shallow hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about a jealous young plot to break up her father and fianc√©. Is it incest or just seeing through the eyes of a daughter with Electra Complex? who cares? All the characters, except Ann (Deborah Kerr), are empty and despicable. Seiberg is poor (I agree with the "boys with breast" comment in a previous review). Plot plot. This predictable article was enough for about 30 minutes of movies that unfortunately extended for over an hour and a half! If you want to see the gorgeous gowns and jewelry on the Riviera, recommend "Catch a Thief" - which will give you extra rewards for an amusing story and lovely characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain me. Personally, I do not really care where the film is placed. Whatever time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some interesting characters. It does not hurt if I can call her. Poor Deborah Carer performs well in the habit, as does David Nevine in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The label "2" is dedicated only to Kerr and Niven, and to the cinema - rich and mysterious color scenes, the forerunner of black and white scenes. Unfortunately, not all great film works in the world can save a poor story with characters that are not fun. Ear implants are still implanted ear. So watching this mess was a serious waste of my time.
