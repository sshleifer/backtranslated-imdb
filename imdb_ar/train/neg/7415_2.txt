What do you call horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing in the movie: I felt that the writers did not really decide what was actually happening in the movie! It's a different thing to know, and we give hints to the public and we do not reveal them completely, but here, you feel that the scriptwriter do not know it, and do not know characters in the film, and the public that no one knows! (Remember "The Cube" even this movie knew more about itself.) <br /> <br /> I've consumed many of the 80's horror films, which certainly has its roots in those films. But many important things are missing. We do not know anything about the characters. Keep repeating the blank lines over and over again. The story does not really evolve - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is OK in this kind of horror movies, but there is not much to be used in the script. We do not care about characters. There is nothing to remember. There is not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no excitement, no chills. <br /> <br /> You can only get some common-use items of horror genre. They show Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters do not really contribute anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that so much of the story and the development of character and atmosphere can be achieved with as little staff as possible. Equipment. Oh yes, filmmakers used to do this - and more - about 20 years ago! I felt the public's embarrassment when the film ended. Really very bad.
