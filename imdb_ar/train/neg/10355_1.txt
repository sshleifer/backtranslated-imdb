I have loved this book since it was read by the fifth grade teacher in our class for many years. I have read this in every chapter of the third and fifth grades over the last 18 years of teaching. It's assumed that a movie was made in the past, but I was never able to locate it. Well, I and our students were very excited when we heard that Disney had brought the excellent Madeleine Lingle book to the screen. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, I had the highest hopes. As the film progressed, she became increasingly desperate. He has failed badly! I have never let me adjust my favorite book to film. I understand that movies can not adhere strictly to a book, but they do not need to change things for that! Most departures, if not all, are absolutely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my mind at first and just heard my students discussing the film. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same feeling - deceived by the great story that Madeleine Engel created skillfully! <br /> <br /> Why, as they wondered, was Aunt Beast resembling Chewbacca from Star Wars? Why can not Calvin be red? Why does a lady who does not have the proper outfit "like a witch" that was such a clever play in her name? Basically, we all wondered - why should all the details be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a film is from this book. I'm still waiting for this film. This was one of the wrinkles of the time in the widest senses. I will write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over the task!
