The game "A Gentleman's Game" uses golf in the preparation of the country club to illustrate the adolescent's discovery of honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was heading, just to prove the error. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that filmmakers have ever known where to turn. Perhaps the defining moment in this film is the scene in which Gary Senis ridicules the Karate Kid and reveals any idea that he will become a teacher of the teenage golfer. It is refreshing, in a way, to reject this film follow most of the simplified and excessive versions of the work. However, many of them are still bearing fruit. When the hat falls, people drop all claims of civility, fail to cling to the things they believe in, or experience something far less respectable than their place in society assumes. Unfortunately, there is often no solution to these moments. Except for the fact that the club acts as their background, there is no real continuity or link to them. It is shameful that the writers and directors were unable to save a better film, especially in view of some talented actors and potential in the preparation.
