After reading another review, I think this movie would be really good. I enjoy "B" movies, but it can not be categorized as such. Photography is probably the only thing halfway in the film. But the amendment left much to be desired. He was very fickle and staccato. Whoever chose music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, especially anything atmospheric setting or scenery. If acting was better, they could have pulled the film. Unfortunately, I've seen representation better in sexual clicks. If you want to watch the Vampire movie "B", check out "blood links". You will be more entertaining.
