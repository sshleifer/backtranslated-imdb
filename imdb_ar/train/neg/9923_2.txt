As I write this review in 2008, we have engulfed a new culture. Film studios seem determined to destroy as many classic films as possible with useless updates, including "King Kong", "The Wicker Man" and almost every film starring Michael Caen. This slow restructuring mentality is not a new phenomenon, as proves the "dough for doing tasks". A completely meaningless version of the Surrealist Bob Clapton masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' absorbs life from the original by splashing colors around the original Clambet footage and adding some new footage overseen by Freese Freiling. Freiling was a very inappropriate way to manipulate Clambite source materials, although in fact no manager could hope to get close to Clambe's madness. Inevitably, then, "the dough in order to do the tasks" is nothing more than a classic rape with a shocking new title attached. For lovers of animation like me, equivalent to the coloration of "Casablanca".
