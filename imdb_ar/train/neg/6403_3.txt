... for the level of intelligence that this comedy works on. Barely up feature length, "Can I do it ..." So I need glasses "" are a bunch of dirty jokes (mostly). Many are too short for you to believe when you realize that it was supposed to be the rejection line (eg Santa Claus); others are so long you can not believe it when you realize they need a lot of time to prepare this package Example: Student Scholarship Awards). Almost all are directed without any art. Do not get me wrong: about 1 in 10 jokes can actually be funny (probably the iron / telephone is my favorite). There are also some magnificent full front knots that prove, once again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on the planet (there are some male comedies too). I agree with others that the stupid title song willfully are actually an attractive curse! But none of these reasons is enough to give this movie anything more than * out of 4.
