I grew up on Scooby Doo where you are, and I still love it. It's one of the favorite cartoons with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan, the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. Although this show is useful for children, the sounds are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are both gay like Scooby and Shaggy), and the distinctive touches are acceptable and can contain some great animations. However it is somewhat disappointing. I usually do not mind Scrappy, but when it appears to be the main character, it becomes annoying quickly. With the phrase "Puppy Power" completed, Scrappy is somewhat more troublesome than usual. Half of the band is missing after the first year, somehow not feeling like Scooby Doo. The jokes and story lines were lame non-native, very small chasing monsters or unveiled bad guys. All in all, not bad like Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get an idea, but this offer is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, sounds, melody theme and the fact that it's good for kids. Bethany Cox
