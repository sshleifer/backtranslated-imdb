As an engineer, I must say that the first season of this show began very auspicious. Most of the applied mathematics was fairly reasonable, and the relationships that were photographed between the brothers and Ibiza gave the exhibition an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began to be very humiliating. Most of the mathematics and technology used to solve the crime has now become very jarring and ridiculous to all people concerned with science and technology. <br /> <br /> The actors' involvement is still fine, and I can imagine a fair amount of money still produced by each episode, but in the end, this turned into a very unpleasant tasting dish which is a mix of thriller movie Class C and a CSI-style copier. <br /> <br /> If you see it, go for the first season only and maybe parts of a second. After that I will not waste my time. By myself, I've made the offer halfway through the third season. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 Stars Season 2 - 5 Stars Season 3 - 3 Stars <br /> <br /> To sum it up 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know mathematics anymore, I will not care about my health as well.
