Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Siegel) and Jeff (Michael Marona) cheated in college. When a creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, scares them to help him enroll with the beautiful beautiful student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> "Comedy" is stupid and incompetent - a lot of whining, which stimulates laughter. The film tries to attract its target audience through its disgusting loopholes - but nothing works. What's more, it is full of characters that are worthless and unattractive - and Schwartzman's personality is disgusting because it represents a big turning point. The film tries to use actress / actress Mami van Durin in the 1950s / 1960s in the most horrifying scenes of the film. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> The sheer unpredictability and waste of (once again) the talent of veteran comedian Joe Flaherty - when he stops accepting every role that comes and does something worthwhile - further undermines her projection. <br /> <br /> All in all, the only thing I liked was James (also known as Jamie) King, who was very attractive - and deserved the best. <br /> <br /> This does not get more than one out of ten of me.
