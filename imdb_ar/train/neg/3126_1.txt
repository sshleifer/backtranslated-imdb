Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like football. Unfortunately, the goal was not made. The historical theme of the Giants is a good subject, but pour into Goose's milk and end up with a giant cheese wheel. I say, take the wheel and roll it over the abyss. I could not even watch the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely walk away from any film. I always love giving them a chance to recover another minute. It is impossible to replace something so bad. Well, at least it was a good representation .... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing "falling" in this movie is the rating. 1/10 and drowning in negative numbers!
