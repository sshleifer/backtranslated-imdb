This is one of the worst slashers B I have ever seen. The end is something you should believe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Harry Standing and Philip Stand sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father get out of the chimney wearing a Santa suit. He puts gifts under the tree, eats donuts and milk and then returns a chimney. Philip goes to bed but Harry goes down only to find that his father is wearing a Santa suit that satisfies his mother sexually. After that, Harry climbs the stairs, smashes a snowball, grabs a glass game, and cuts himself off. <br /> <br /> Then you move to the present time. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in Santa's suit and watches young children through binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children and the other for bad children. Write everything they do in these books. The man is creeping. He also works at the Jolly Dream Games Factory. His brother Philip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry discovers that his boss is only interested in profits, he goes and collects all the games and hands them over to a few children. He then travels to the church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts gifts under the tree. Children catch him but return to bed. So, Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he was walking towards a house, a group of children watched him and ran to him. Parents feel nervous and try to persuade their children to return to them so that they do not get hurt. How do they know that Harry is a murderer? Sure, you should be suspicious because you never know who it can be. Harry presents gifts to the children and the father takes out a switch to try to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry escapes, the light of the city's inhabitants shines and follows him to kill him. They do not know he is the murderer. When Harry arrives at his brother's house, he and his brother have little talk and are strangled by Philip. He just loses consciousness. Philip holds Harry back in his car. When Harry wakes up, he sets off. <br /> <br /> The end is something I did not believe. Again, you'll have to see her believe it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that shocked me was Black Santa. That's right, the man in Santa's suit was a white man. So why did they bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip this and watch Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You will get your money worth watching these two films. They are the best of this garbage pile! I give this movie one star out of 10. I wish I would give it a 0 star because that's what the movie deserves.
