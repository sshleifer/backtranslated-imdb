This subject deserves a much better screenplay, the final result, than the screening of this film. The scenario is full of holes because it has never been depicted as a story, but a series of nightmare scenarios are drawn together. Gaps and loose limbs in the story line are numerous. The scene in which the abducted victim is told that her parents have not died, and who have been looking for her since she was captured, is just a strange thing. It is written as an elaborate therapeutic moment with the head of a refuge for fugitives who have handed it a "missing sticker" since she was eight years old. In real life, if a homeless head of smugglers discovers that he was kidnapped under the roof of his house, what he would have followed was an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement issue and not a 12-minute part of an opera. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for unjustified exploitation. Funny, this is supposed to be condemned by this film. In the end he seems to have joined.
