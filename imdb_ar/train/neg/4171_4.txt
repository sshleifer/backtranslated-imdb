I passed that title 15 or 20 times while in Blockbuster, looking for something decent halfway to see it. All I can say is they were all halfway in decent movies the night I chose where to rent this. <br /> <br /> I will give it credit for Connie jumping better than Dracula 3000, but in fact this is very easy to say since this one does not have Capper van Diane in it. Other things that the Pistons lacked were: interesting team, interesting story, good dialogue, originality, but I suspect you can not get it all. <br /> <br /> *** The Misfit crew of the vampire hunters (one of them was a vampire ... goes shape) flew from the mining colony to the mining colony in an attempt to eliminate all the vampires You are a grandfather. The crew consists of: a cocky captain, Noir Doe Will (who dies early), his companion in his book, yet lacks the first experience, the vampire hunter mentioned above (and not typewritten), the truly brave Asian Cowboys, Strong man "... looks like a MTV actor in the" real world ". After the captain's death in a violent confrontation with a crowd of vampires (and as it turned out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) takes his first mate ... Blah, Blah, Blah ... Everybody hates him ... Blah, Blah, Blah ... I can continue, but as I said it is the same story used in about a hundred other "films" of this kind. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this film is out of my will. It was a vampire hunter (still not a typo) too hot, but of course if you wait for it to expose more than just splitting it, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say that it was the worst movie I've ever seen, as I actually hired "Starship Troopers 2", but wait until this movie comes on Sci-Fi.
