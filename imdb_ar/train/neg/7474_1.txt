This program did not do this for me, although I admire this type. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not one scene that was not dominated by the main character. This made it a little bit 2D, and I gave up the program before it was finished. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism because I am not a film critic, however, the IMDb guidelines should be put in 10 lines of commentary. You reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way that the main character in each scene is, and I hope that this book will use more diversity to interact with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, just after watching things like "The Wire", I expect wonderful things from a police drama.
