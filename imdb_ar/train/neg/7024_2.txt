I raced this film because it was not only because its theme was gay but the idea of ​​role-playing really filled me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was filmed in San Francisco because I live near SF. Of course it was good to see footage of the Castro area (although Castro is more interested in gay than female). But otherwise I can not really recommend this film. The characters are not really being developed to care about them, and when I finally started to get into "role playing", I was bored with my mind. The scenes of the roles I saw were a little embarrassing to watch. Acting leaves nothing to be desired. Needless to say, I did not finish the film. I was skipping this one.
