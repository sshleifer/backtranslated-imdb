A cheap and boring story of mind and acting. Not a single good mistake, not a bad enough mistake to be good, not to be delivered in an unforgettable way. Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inefficient the actors were and how little pleasure any of them had. It was false and mysterious, unsupported, and the opponents failed to be creeping or believing. The "homogeneous" tones were undesirable and unsatisfactory, and were limited to young boys who cared about their boxes while being content with boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but little work has kept me and at least my girlfriend awake.
