(Known as TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This sequel seems to have been made to take advantage of the success of the European box office at THE CALL ME TRINITY. This time, Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy wanted to make use of it in America As well. Too bad, they did not go very far because the Hill / Spencer images achieved marginal success here only in the United States, and this largely boring and tedious film does not help him out. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Pampino, their deceased father (Harry Carey Jr.), vowed that they would become outlaws and care for each other. They later get involved with arms smugglers who smuggle weapons from the monastery, who mistakenly believe they are a couple of federal clients. All of this ends with some funny scenes, especially those with Trinity and Bambino in a fancy French restaurant and they do not know how to carry themselves. The scenes with shark cards were rather funny. <br /> <br /> The music of Jane Roman's opening title looks like a pop song similar to Bobby Goldsboro in the early 1970s, while music is all over the film. very good. I'm not sure if I'd like to buy a CD from him but others might. <br /> <br /> It was possible that the film had stopped for half an hour and had not lasted for long. It seems that a lot of landscape is being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in them about 2 / 3rds of the way through. The DVD is also awful, with a continuous sound in the soundtrack and a bad print that seems to have been sent to the big scrap pile in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
