This is the most frustrating entry on IMDb that I have not found yet. All previous reviewers act like this movie. This is not the film. Instead, it's just another feature on the DVD for "The One" and it's nowhere near the 90-minute period listed here. In fact, it is hardly more than 13 minutes how can Jet Li martial arts. And its implications for the film. So yes this IMDb entry is slightly fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews because they are wrong. You can trust me, because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> This is the truth. I think you can say I'm the only reviewer that matters.
