A propaganda film about the Palestinian "cause". If you're expecting an unbiased documentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you are anti-Semitic (or just anti-Zionist - there is nothing wrong with calling for the destruction of a state, is it?) Or pro-Palestinian support (such as mass murder and destruction of Israel), this is your documentary. It should make an entertaining evening at university campuses throughout the UK and the United States. However, anyone who is enlightened and intellectually honest will be angry at the number of lies presented in this video. I only hope that those who are not familiar with the situation are not exposed to corruption because of this anti-Semitic filth.
