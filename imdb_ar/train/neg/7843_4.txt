This is a weak sequence: it lacks the attention and light touch of the wonderful "horse called" horse on almost every side and when compared with each other they hardly seem the same type. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to invoke various Indian celebrations, but it is a very difficult attempt to mobilize the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe loses and neglects, having lost their homeland, modern life has passed paradise and they live in misery and abject poverty. Maybe that was the point: the first film took us to a place where we wanted to be, a simpler time. This leads us to the broken Indians in a miserable world, the white man is the hero and the Savior who denies the idea of ​​the entire film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lies in the fact that the white man has learned and discovered that true civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second film, there is nothing we lack, so we end with a weak film. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment.
