I did not expect much of a film directed by Sidney J. Furry and starring Dolph Lundgren but I was expecting more than just an award. Does not seem to comment one user - motion picture of the second order - very low for me for the film Lundgren. On the other hand, I did not bother watching this movie if it was rated less than 5.0 but hey, the film achieved 5.9 out of 10 points, which seemed acceptable to me for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now I realize that 37.5% of the people who rated this movie as 10 (excellent) were obviously a publicity campaign because DETENTION is the normal trash of the Nu Image image I've seen before, over and over again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren is not persuaded when a former military turned into a history teacher for a rough school. His representation is just awful, emotional and inflammatory. Lundgren's inability to work becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquents. Either they are wonderful actors or, as opposed to Lundgren, they seem to be wonderful actors - just because they seem natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION contains some of the elements that were likely to be interesting for this low-budget film - a closed weekend film at a high security high school, four teenagers in detention with a veteran teacher and a group of criminals who No mercy they try to enter - but the story (something like The BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it a panic room?) Is full of incredible situations, lots of clich√©s and stereotypes. Let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Carisis and Kata Dubo play a couple of Bonnie and Clyde in love and offer the best accepted performances of the film, even if it looks like a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell, which Mila Jovovich wants to be. In a movie where everything failed, their madness and style provided enough fresh air to prevent my interest from landing to zero.
