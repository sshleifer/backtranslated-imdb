It was a very painful film to watch ... not in the good dramatic way that makes you flounder with the emotions of well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I made this last sentence very much with my progress), but in an absolutely boring way for over two hours. Now, you may all think that I am just a clueless reference that does not respect Shakespeare or "artistic filmmaking" ... well, you will be wrong in either case. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo, Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I have seen a lot of "arthouse" movies such as the surrealhead and well made and Philini 8 1/2. .. but this was just over two hours from Shakespeare's missing translation, and the way too much nudity (I can understand nudity in some technical scenes ... but not every other shot of a movie !!! It was hard to deliver and his services were not Something for the story !!!), and basically just an overly enthusiastic film industry. I had great expectations for this film in terms of being said to be "very technical" and adapted to Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was just a big disappointment. This film was given only three due to the presence of actor Sir John Gilgod (who far surpassed all the names not mentioned in this film) and the film / set design group because they made a lot of scenes look like animated boards ... However, much of this movie It was better off as it was just a painting with text moving down it. A real disappointment ... Perhaps if Zverelli was given the post of chairman, it would have been much better. But this is the opinion of one member of the audience, many others may enjoy this much more than me. However, if you can not find this in any of the nearby video stores (not currently on DVD), do not try to go away on your way to find it ... it's not really worth it.
