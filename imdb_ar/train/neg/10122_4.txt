Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock appears to have been executed from a contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paycock, you can tell that Hitchcock did not have much interest in this film. There is almost no style or craft at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, two married young men, bringing some money and going on a cruise that proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily offers an opportunity for a new life with a good-hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the highway and stay with her husband. This may sound more believable if Farid is not unique in that he is recently completely insensitive, jumping at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife to another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the film lacks any real reconciliation scene. The third chapter goes in a completely different direction, stranded in an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry offers a powerful show as a sincere wife to an unfaithful husband. That's all you can say for this one.
