I will not usually write an online comment, but this is the worst film I have ever seen. Not only was it filmed just like soap series ("Youth and Anxiety" is actually filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also contains awful discounts. He has no work. It is full of useless rubbish. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: A man wants to kill the main character when he is shot because of him. So (after a lot of crap) here: the man puts a knife in his throat and says something like "You're dead now". Then the main character says: "If you kill me, you're dead." I told the police that you were threatening me. " So the killer man goes (about to cry): "Oh no ... The police are following me !? Oh ... my God." <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe this movie already exists. So: If you want to watch the worst movie ever ... Continue, I recommend it :)
