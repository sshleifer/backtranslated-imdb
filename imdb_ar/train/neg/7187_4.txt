Here we go with a clumsy movie, good-looking people and the representation of everyone was really good! <br /> <br /> Few children play phone calls with pranks and there are parents killed by the killer in front of children! After 20 years of being friends, they go to a huge house, and enjoy drugs and sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour of the film! Once again, they start making phone calls via slips again! Then the killer returns killing them one by one and the killer in BIG BLACK COAT with the ax just like Urban Legend, <br /> <br /> The scene of death is really strange, and in very strange times too. <br /> <br /> The nice nice movie was given in this part 7/10 but the twisting at the end of the movie made the whole film a kind of indifference <br /> <br /> Twist shot the film for me so I will give it 10/04
