The film was very disappointed. Especially since it was directed by Breyadeshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. The bad scenario (almost nonexistent) and the sequence of songs with bad songs every minute and most of the time alien kill any humor that can be provided by the film. Some scenes were funny, but they were probably only 5 minutes long. The editing was pathetic. bleak! Overall the film was disappointed because the lack of a story was very clear. In fact, only a few people remained to watch the second half of the film after the interval. <br /> <br /> You'll never miss a thing if you do not see the movie. Not worth spending money a valuable ticket on this film. Wait until it appears on TV ...
