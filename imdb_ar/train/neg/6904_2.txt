It seems to me, as a recent film school graduate, that at this time when the New Zealand film has reached new heights, people seem to think that every New Zealand film is fantastic. Sione's Wedding proved that this was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> It's totally overpriced and not funny, and far from the "funny" movie, other users commented on IMDb. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek the Wacky Black Man, but otherwise the stupid jokes we all heard were recycled. <br /> <br /> Being half of Samoa, I wanted to see how the film would deal with Polynesian representation. It was a complete game - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had anything new to say about the Polynesian identity, even if it was in cheekbones. Michael was the only player to play with white women. His role comes a bit when "Dusky Maiden" comes to the city and celebrates Christmas. Maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then At the last minute he rejects it and accepts his position as a fringe of Polynesia for women in Balaji. I did not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see her expecting a good laugh, but it ended up really bitterness of paying to see her in the cinema. Lame jokes at best, acting, especially girlfriend Sefa, APPALLING, frankly, I was happy if I had put my hand on one of those pirated copies of the movie to save the $ 15 ticket price. <br /> <br /> I think the only good thing coming from the film is that this is the second step (behind the number 2, of course, a very superior film on this film) in the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope that future Pacific filmmakers will learn from the Sion wedding in how not to express Polynesia and have something more meaningful and rational. Even if it was done comically.
