"The Big Big Thing" is a silly comedy that hangs out of the wall about a man who yearns to start a magazine called The Big Big Thing, which shows a variety of artists up And the next. This low budget indie makes "Chuck & Pak" look like a masterpiece. Often the "thing", full of bad business, shoddy collections, fashion, etc., has got some horrific comments and so far has been nominated for only one margin prize. Move this one.
