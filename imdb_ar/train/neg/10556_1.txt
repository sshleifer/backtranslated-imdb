This is a good example of how not to produce a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context of events, and persistent differences between scenes that seem irrelevant. The result is a confusing, ignorant viewer. It is impossible to follow the plot completely and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. <br /> <br /> This film is linked to many human atrocities and attempts to show the extent of error, focusing on child abuse. It includes some footage of horrific acts of violence, including wartime executions. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that it is possible to present ideas behind the film without resorting to this extreme content. This film is not intended for vulnerable patients or easily insulted, and should not be offered to minors under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> The height of the peak is hostile to its climate compared to the content of the rest of the film. If you do not hear the comment as it happens, you probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a single shot, "Sit down and let the guy talk, without any cuts" comment. Although this is not necessarily bad, the director will end up very much and sometimes spend minutes complaining at once of his college, filming conditions, co-producers, bad films, and dozens of other things. Undermines ongoing negativity, which is an essential tool for understanding film. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed several years ago on a 16mm film Super8 over four years with a very low budget. For this reason, the quality of video and audio is bad. This alone does not make it a bad film, but it makes the film a bad one.
