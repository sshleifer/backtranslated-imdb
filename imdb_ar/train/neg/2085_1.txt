This is one of the worst films I have seen recently. When a man says that he wishes to have a great power to be able to satisfy himself verbally, I consider the film to be in the world of 14-year-old male delusions. The bedroom scene had ended from the top and reduced the intimate moment to a farce of biological functions closer to passing gas in public places. From the first scene, there was a discussion about how much sex they were getting, how long they had been since they had had time, when their next sexual contact would be, and who they should be with. Moreover, dialogue and representation were too bad and too coercive, they did not feel it, and filled their lack of content with shaky sexual scenes. This could have been really funny because the concept is really interesting, but its implementation is weak here. Please, do not think of taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see him.
