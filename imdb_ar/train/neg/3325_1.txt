Her hatred. If you think everyone in the South is stupid or bankrupt in terms of morality, stupidity, violence, religious nuts, or child molestation, this film might be right for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a public store and one of them says he molested a group of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and obviously the other man considered her a normal part of life. very nice. A teenage girl walks back in search of her sister and no one offers her help - despite the apparent limp and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathran's character is not only disgusting and totally vanity, but he appears to be a religious believer who reflects (the usual nature of Hollywood) the hateful nature of Christians. A great scene in the film reminds us of the end of Cape Fear (DeNiro) - the Bible verses that the bad man launched. I'm from the northwest of the country, but I found this movie offensive because of the wonderful people I know from North Africa, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
