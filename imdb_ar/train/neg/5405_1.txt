I got this as a turkish movie and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Representation - In general, although many of them were in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to act consistently bad on this whole film with inadvertently dropping a degree of representation. <br /> <br /> The plot - to be a vine I can say that the screenwriter originally started with a scheme but did what he could to ignore. The plot disrupted faster and then the Chinese fell off the computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - Now that was an abomination to nature. Failure to flow with any rhyme or cause. The majority of the lines according to the characters were pathetic at best. The script worked hard to make sure that no character could become distinctive. I've seen other films where the additions were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! It was a special short bus <br /> <br /> directive - so you can get out of your steering ability to copy your favorite director style or you will not create failures like this. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family give you 10 stars for this movie
