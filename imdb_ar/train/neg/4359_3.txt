Wow, after smashing Timo Roses' CD of "Rot City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than cursing meaninglessly ... I think some people do not get it) I was interested in this film. I read some very positive things, and it seems that the film refills its appearance away from the total trash that I expected after the "City of Rotation". <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not a complete trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of German horror / film like Olaf Itenbach and the like. This means that the "barricade" in the parts is very detailed and detailed. The foreign exchange market is not really believable, but well, things are going well, but in some cases, things are easily absorbed. The hill chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not improve until it is filmed. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... The movie is fantastic, and it has a typical German ambience underground (including classic explosive shots in the blood), FX OK and a modern feeling to it like the packaging is already promised ?! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is the sum of the BS. You can get a typical hillbilly / lost in the forest story with some gal + camping players outside the house and meet the dilapidated hillbilly family. Everything only leads to torture scenes / distortion and it seems incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" chilly. <br /> <br /> Random is also the perfect description of many of the camera's works (I liked the repetitive pieces of tweezers in the scene of the intense torture ... either they did not have any material or the editor worked at a hardware store). What's worse than editing ... Sure, it's a much better talk than many other movies in this genre but Random. I have overused this usual exposure effect everywhere and without meaning ... it only exists ... all the time. After that, there is the appearance of a grainy film being thrown here and there for it, I do not get the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the above effects there are lots of repetitive things here. For example, most killings are repeated with multiple repeats for stabbing and punching. It's ok once but here is annoying and fake, especially in the end. Annoying annoying "music" that is used permanently without any change in the background. It does not take long to make the movie unlikely. <br /> <br /> 4. Of all this comes the biggest problem in this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a graceful movie with the trash, it feels stupid to polish it with a special FX and edit a new school. They seem to take it very seriously. It's not fun because Gore FX decent gets lost in this context. Where the traditional FX program is fine, an FX computer in scenes like a sting in the mouth or shots in the end seems rather silly (while a 3D machine gun often absorbs it even in budget movies and 3D artists). <br /> <br /> I often wonder if the time of scattering serious movies and the "barricade" is just another example that may be the time to put it in the grave. It is not fun, nor personal to him, nor is he very rude to his appearance. The script is a cheap attempt on "wrong run" and "TCM" does not lead anywhere at all. You can literally take it ... The ending is completely present and random like many other things here ("I love you" with the dust ... Come on !!). "Barricade" tries to merge a lot and fail ... You can quickly confirm through this film for some extensive visceral removal, acidic solubility, and nipple disc, classic Friday, stabbed the couple in his thirteenth style while finger in a bloody tent !). But it's really hard to get this. The total failure is special because you can see that it could have been something.
