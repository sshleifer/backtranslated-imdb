What's up with Robert "buzz" Altman? Was he saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring film that it was laughable. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time with anything Altman makes: it's all a misleading waste of the film.
