Tells us that Hallam Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and presents a kind of complex of Oedepus afterwards. <br /> <br /> It takes about 95 minutes but it will be better in ten minutes. There is almost an hour in the middle where a climbing exercise is practiced on rooftops, and habits in the church tower such as Quasimodo (only is much less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There is a strange love story involved that does not include "nothing to do with it." He happens to look like his mother, yes what about it? We know he's missing his mother, and that's what the first 10 minutes were. Putting the beginning and end together was supposed to be a short film ... Now it's a picture of a person who does not change ... He is a man who speaks things ... His only active choice in the middle of the entire film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There is something Oedepus He 's drawing his face, wearing women' s clothes, and wearing a dead Badger on his head ... Ghirir! You have to see the end! He took it down with the badger on his head (and it was filmed as a vulgar horror film) to kill his new father's wife (who had first fucked her.) And somehow they thought that would not be amusing enough, so they put some independent punk music in the background, However, I feel sensitive to films that want to write myself down on your nose, it looks like a McKenzie man / man trying to show us that he was also studying psychology at school. Thank you for returning all these forgotten theories to our memory! I've really dug! Yalha from the Waldorf! Well, I've realized now that this movie relies on some random books, but anyway .. <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. Lots of talking heads. In addition to that the editor has changed the colors from one scene to another, you are learning to chill, warm up and so on. Why? Perhaps "Hallam Foe" is both an advantage and a film test for the blind color. Or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that it felt lonely, so it increased its blue color until we really got it. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on unique, cute, how-to-clich√© drawings in the presentation. And all sexual things "cute" happens. This whole film is an independent cliche. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a student in the cinema and to see how such nonsense passes through the machine.
