Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding in his Montana ranch after failure The arrest of a notorious terrorist. Then the agency contacted him again to travel to London to get another flight. His target has been captured there and is under intense police protection - but they do not want him to just arrest their men - they want to get him out. Things went well but then the mission failed and when a big police chief, Windsor (Charles Dans) was killed, Dial's feet were blamed. Like an animal, he resorts to a nearby house and authenticates a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with her own issues and becomes an unwelcome friend as he goes on purging his name and working on his own. br /> <br /> These latest Snipes came out directly to the escapade DVD from anywhere, with minimal advertising even for a very small time (I can not remember seeing any ads or trailers anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes' history In a DVD tune effort, this may sound like one that Snoop Dogg will tell you to fall like it's hot. But I felt I had to give her a push anyway. It does not rank among the worst it has, but it does not reach a level higher than some of its best standards (says The Detonator, 7 seconds, everything, really), either. <br /> <br /> This, at best, is somewhat disgusting, with minimal work, unbearable only in the path of quiet and serene dialogue not exactly at its best in the leading role. Similarly, in the main support role, it is quite clear that the dance was only shown in the paycheck too and that in general no actors would shout at the hills about any of their autobiography. <br /> <br /> He often says that in the end, the only "contract" that keeps you interested is when Snipes will end up with Sony and end up with other EL DVD movies. **
