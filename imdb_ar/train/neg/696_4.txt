Er, not a particularly good slick flick. Representation, influences, soundtracks are decent, familiar and non-innovative. <br /> <br /> There are three consecutive deaths near the beginning of the film that make a fairly good scene in which everything seems to be going well. Apart from that, there are a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what is going on, or chasing red herring; killing more time than people. There are other deaths, the killer is an equal opportunity killer, not partially to carry any one. The killer also likes to recruit other people to kill innocent people as well. Identity is not detected in the end, the motivation is too thin, we do not really care. <br /> <br /> The film is supposed to be about Christmas, but that's not a major factor. A torch lights up with Christmas lights, that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie is somewhat bold with a muddy image most of the time, at least in the video you watched. Some dialogue has lost some opening scenes. The end must be stronger than it was. We believe we are aware of what happened, although there is an opportunity for something else.
