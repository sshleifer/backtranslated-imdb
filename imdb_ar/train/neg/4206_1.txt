I was in the premiere of this film at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. After the show, when the author / director and some team members presented the answer to questions, it was not possible to bother anyone with a question. Rarely was the film directed very badly (why on Earth were random frames cut off from some scenes?), A miserable act (David Arquette, to rework Dorothy Parker, does not manage the emotional gradient from A to B. Gardens in A and brings lunch) Feasibility. The characters behave completely without any reason other than to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film reached a completely random and meaningless ending supposed to "make you really think". Unfortunately, what makes you think is, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I will never go back to."
