I will not be quick to look at all the good reviews and say this may be a good offer ... This offer is good only if you do not know what the "talent" is. I will not even say how much the attack is (I know it could be offensive to many people) Because this does not really bother me with the show. What bothers me is that people watch it and think it's funny. It makes me feel like our generation is getting more stupid, and I'm really afraid it will someday be run by people watching this trash. /> Basically, the plot is simple .. It is about offensive women and self-centered (Sarah) Silvermen) Get daily life .. <br /> <br /> That's all in It does not happen a million times ... In fact, almost every joke is either performed or racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing .. I love her voice .. that's all. There are no words .. Her words are awesome..and you like to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you want to see hot women put everyone else down and make not feel like nonsense while at the same time jitter And to say crap about each race, this offer suits you ..
