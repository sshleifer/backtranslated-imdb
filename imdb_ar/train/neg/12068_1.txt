A family of horrible people must stay at home for a week or they will lose their inheritance, which will go to the servants who will get their inheritance only if they agree to stay at home and keep it in order. People die (and so are you if you try to sit in this). If you have any desire to see bad actors - many with bad behavior or trying to act in a horror film, this is your chance. This is just awful. It's very bad that I thought Adamson, one of the worst directors ever, directed it, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It's very bad that I do not want to say anything more about it, not because it is not so polite but because once I start, I may not be able to stop. <br /> <br /> Avoid it
