This inefficient adaptation of one of Martin Ames's weakest novels fails even to make comparisons with other drug sensibilities like Requiem For A Dream or anything Irvine Walsh has written while struggling to determine whether it is a cartoon or a slap in the hallucinatory reality. <br /> <br /> A group of school dropouts are converging in a palace waiting for three American friends to see a weekend of drug abuse. That's it. With the exception of the funny subterfuge that will soon become the nonsense of the main conspiracy around an extremist cult that expresses itself with the violent murder of the elite figures of the world, whether political or pampered. Inside the first pulley, you know exactly where this happens. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor such as Paul Bettani do in this terrible cavity written? Made before his rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly can be sure that if he were introduced to this trash now he might change agents immediately! Avoid.
