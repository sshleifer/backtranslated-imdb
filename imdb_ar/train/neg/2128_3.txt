The remake is unnecessary and can not approach the capture of the original charm. Extreme length causes more than a few parts stimulates yawning. This version is politically correct and ironic. The film lacks elegance and often lacks talent, not only with acting, but direction, collections, fashion and others are all substandard. It has a blatant disregard for more detail period. Vanessa Williams is a member of the only acting team that shows any inclination, and Tina Daly is not so bad. They should have left them alone enough. The singing range is good (Vanessa Williams) with the poor (anyone else). See the original 1963 version and skip this version. There is not much here to recommend.
