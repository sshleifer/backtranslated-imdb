This movie does not contain any humor for anyone living with a family member with a mental illness. Many scenes reminded me of my own experiences. This film was the man's version of "Dear Mother". It depicts graphically and accurately the life experienced by many children from a parent with mental illness. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No, I say! It's a sick humor at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and frustrating that my son had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what we are doing to families.
