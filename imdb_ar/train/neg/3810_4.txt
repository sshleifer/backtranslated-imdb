When I was young, I loved this show, but now ... DISCOVER !!! This offer is happy, poorly written, and seldom funny. The three performances were all good actors and funny people (Sagitt's position was much better than the things this show brought, as Collier was a better position, and Stamos was better than the regular actor). After a while, he wanted to get out of the program because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was finally canceled when many representatives demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the things that drove me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Catch phrases - how often can one person deal with tired fishing phrases like "how rude" "I got this dude man", "nerdbomber", "cut it" and "have mercy" in a 24 hour time period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimi Jibler - the most disturbing character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Write stale and cliche as an oreo cookie. There is good vulgar writing and nasty vulgar writing. Full House had a nasty cliche. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living in San Francisco - Enough is enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Things unrealistic - too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashionable Kids - The girls got the latest fashion in the mall, and you can see posters of modern recording artists who will be inside. <br /> <br /> Now this offer is on Nick @ Nite. I hardly call it a classic. I do not have anything bad to say about the people concerned because I think many of them are talented in themselves. But this offer was very resolved, I could not stand it after a while.
