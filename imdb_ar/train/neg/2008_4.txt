I do not recall whether Anne Rivers Sidons adapted the "The House Next Door" from her 1970s novel, The Same, or someone else's. This film, which is similar to the old age, was directed by Canadian director Geoff Woolno. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take the opportunity when the film appeared on a telegram of what was obviously a movie for television. You know that when critical moments precede commercials, which of course one can not find in this version we have seen. <br /> <br /> The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle, who is wearing a new look that has thrown a curve because of the cosmetic transition that this actress underwent. From new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle can not be identified as Colonel Kennedy, the character at the heart of the mystery. This was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the camera. That applies to the rest of Canadian actors who deserve better. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of the intersection between "Desperate Housewives" and "Stepford Wives" and other known features, along with a light dose of creep. The best thing about the movie is the house that works as a setup.
