When I saw previews of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but it would be funny at least. Well I was wrong. Although the producers in depth have received an exciting message to express parents leaving alone and re-evaluating their lives, the way they tried to deliver them was terrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But in the end, I could have predicted what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I love a total of five lines for dialogue and everything else was at best, which is still at best more than I can tell for the film itself.
