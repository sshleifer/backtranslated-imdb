Reines, Wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amur faces the challenge of making French music from the 1930s in vivid colors. The opening of the soundtrack with the old decorative titles was a nice touch. Then open the camera slot (such as Old Hand Cranks) on a black and white advertising plate. The camera falls back (or rather, up) and suddenly shows us the amazingly brilliant colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. That's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A pretty pretty doll with a group of 3 unattached girls attacking some of the nonsense that is not related to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame it in translation). These characters are crowded from the door and replaced by more people who break into a more forgotten song. Then they leave, Audrey Tautou finally shows up and we hear the first concrete dialogue in the film after 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais meant by starting such a time-wasting time and cuddly music. But the effect on the bidder is that you want to throw the bowling game on the screen and get rid of it. I have endured. <br /> <br /> The situation has not improved much. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no knowledge of any of the characters. We do not see their faces until half the time (Resnais seems very determined to display the supernatural landscape to take care of actual people in front of the camera). People fly inside and outside the theater like moths around a lamp, and our audience is unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It looks like you're going to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and install it in a two-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me watching as long as I (one hour) was that I was looking at camera techniques, lighting and landscape that were all, I admit, excellent. But is this enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to watch the end. AW, who am I joking. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you're doing it too. skip this.
