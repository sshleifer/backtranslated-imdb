Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: mostly Lucio Fulci, Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring and Deran Serafin <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this click and get good basic information about it, I'll start from the beginning. The beginning of this is really George Romeros' Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in the year 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to him and named him Zombie 2. This film is a movie that we know as normal ole Zombie. You know the one who fights the zombie shark! Well, after that click appeared (called Zombie 2 in Italy) and got a great deal of money, the Italians decided, heck. Let's make some more zombie clicks! These things scratch in the dough! So I was born a coma 3. Confused yet? The story in this story is really just a rephrase of the stories we have seen in many of the American zombie films we saw before this story, and the best comparison comes to mind is the return of the living dead. Let's see ... there is a government experimenting with a specific poison gas that will turn people into zombies. The box is released in the general population and shebang! We get amounts of zombies yearning for human flesh. A group of people begin to flee the zombie and end up in an old deserted hotel. You have to fight Zombie to survive. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of trouble filming this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci was the godfather of the beloved Al Gore of Italy sick. So he could not finish this movie the way he wanted. The film was later delivered to two small directors Bruno Matte (The Inferno of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasu (Zombi 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was not really good. You see Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disappointed. He gave a flick to the producers and basically said: "Do whatever you want the hell!" God loved them. <br /> <br /> That is why Ladies and Gentlemen have a flick about the great zombie zombie that the "director" is attributed to. The main problem in my opinion is that this is just tampering! There is no subject at all! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal toxic gases and accidentally launch them, the rest of the click is just a group of empty figures without spirit, and there is no character at all emanating from the zombie. Now, in some cases, this can be fun, if the zombie # 1 and the zombie action well and really enjoyable, the # 2 there is a lot of courage and courage. <br /> <br /> Here we will not get anything! Well, there are some inspiring moments there, for example when some eagles catch gas and start attacking people. That was great. There is also a scene related to the flying zombie head (which defies all logic and explanation by the way) and a scene with the zombie coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and beating the legs of poor girls. But apart from that ... the rest of the click flattens completely in the backside. <br /> <br /> Endless when countless scenes do not work to trigger a plot that does not already exist. That was my main gripe with this flick. Groups seem incomplete and technical guidance is not practical. I hate when everything seems incomplete! I love my B movies, but this one just went really less! It's closer to the flick level z, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Zombie make up? Pure crap. All zombies are Asian actors (filmed in the Philippines) until they get a group of Asian zombies. But this is not a big problem because the film was set in the Philippines Islands anyway. Have a look of the zombies that really suck! They all died in one garment for some reason. What works in the coma of makeup here is a set of black make-up (like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex makeup, but it was not good enough to impress him. It's just a bunch of goo that fluttered uselessly on the faces of actors. So not only is this a slow paced flick but zombies look crap. These are supposed to be dead! However, for those who expect the usual chill in the Fulci flick, they do not hope to expect it here because this is often rejected by someone else. These two implicated people (Matte and Vragaso) did not have a heart or a soul. In fact, when you see the additions on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso asks about his memories and feelings about this here, he does not take it seriously. You can say he's ashamed of it and on many occasions he says "they just had work and done it". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There is no love, and there is no heart in making this film. So, you get half a click from zombie crappy. <br /> <br /> Only for the complete or for people who wish to have every zombie bout or see it. Everyone, do not bother! Rating: 1 out of 5
