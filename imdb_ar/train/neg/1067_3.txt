Only a handful of sectors are engaging here. A piece with a garage escort from Nigeria is tragic. One point with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins is her point of view and evolution until the last shot is over. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few videos call Paris. Others are scatteringly in appearance, tone, will and production so you can see "Best Years Commercials, 2006". It's really everywhere. This does not develop over time, and there is nothing that controls the directors. There is no structure that successfully joins the pieces ... Tedium exists. I'm in one hour, twenty minutes, and Elijah Wood in a stupid state, finished - commercial, excessive shtick vampire. It is as much about Paris as for old knitting women in the South Pole. Fantasy first appears in the Coen Brothers section (oh, thank J & E for sabotaging another movie), and then has a large number of themes. The purpose of your presence in Paris is that you do not need to be foolish to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it into the neighborhood if Cartier de la Madeleine is equal to the vampires of some of the losers? There has never been more of a movie genre than a vampire movie. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Making things worse is that switching from piece to piece is a work of art. Transformations are lost. This does not feel intentional, he feels upset.
