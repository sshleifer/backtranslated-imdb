How this film escaped the anger of MST3K and I never know. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action film, full (or is it empty?) With thin paper charts, stupid characters and rewarding positions. But, take it from me, if you enjoy watching the poor movies, but the idiot, you will enjoy "Gymkata" a lot. <br /> <br /> Events are centered around a gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see that his father was another semi-government agent, he has lost competition in this game, eloquently called "the game." So the gymnast (played by Kurt Thomas nicely) competes in this game and knows what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Does this seem promising? Well, so, still, that bone-bone planning does not begin to describe the joys of this film. They can be found in exotic film details. Like his mysterious Asian girlfriend gymnast, who does not talk about the first half of the film, suddenly start to talk, do not shut up for the rest of the time! Or the bad guy who does not wear a shirt and who loves making and breaking the rules of the game "The Game" does not exist whenever he wants. And of course there are our delightful heroes who enjoy the "Village of The Crazies" (obviously this is the real name of the place!). Nice place to visit, but I do not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines, it represents the scenes of motion. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the manager thought it wise to introduce gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and squares of Middle Eastern cities so that our master in Gymkata could use his gymnastics skills to fight the evil scourge in parallel. Destroyed bars and horses. It must be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> There is something interesting to note. Too often, I say that about half of the cast dies from shooting him with a shot. Interesting because the stock is the only credible effects or movement in the entire movie. If these are indeed effects, it is my main observation to pay tribute to those who have created the very real effects of darts. Most likely, this was the film's way of not paying extra. However, the "Gymkata" is worth a look if you can see it without paying and looking for some absurdity that is an easy target to roam around. <br /> <br />
