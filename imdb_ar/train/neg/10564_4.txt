The real shame of the "gathering" is not in bad behavior, nor is it in the abominable shallow conspiracy. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series I started, although it has one major attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for only five minutes. She has that irony, that wit, that double-edged and volatile personality at the same time. Unfortunately, although the film "Babel 5" demo has an incredibly boring story involving an assassination. Fortunately, Patricia Talman - who is no longer seriously into the series until late - has become fortunately better with a lifetime like Alexandra Lita, who is here a little more than a thin and boring telepath. I will leave you with a final idea - why does Dylan look like a frog man in outer space (although she is a woman)? We thank the heavens for the way that Minbari later viewed the presentation.
