As a Turkish man now living in Sweden, I must admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most of them if I never understand. I think Scandinavian actors work better in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Wedding Wedding" with an outspoken Polish friend, both of whom said it was the worst film we've ever seen. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, nor females ever so-called star Helen Bergstrom. This is a very silly plot no one can believe. I think it's all a mess from the start. Lots of bad behavior except from Seldal and Wollter. Ahmed Salam
