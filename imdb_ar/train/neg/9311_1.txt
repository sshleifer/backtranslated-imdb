I think they made a film about the sweet teeth of twisted metal black that is still a really wonderful idea, but the actors of this movie are the worst, then the performance of Ben in Pearl Harbor, the best porn quality and the best actors. I would buy a DVD, but fortunately I hired it first. The script and the script are also terrible, there seems to be nothing together, so it seems that the film never makes sense. The weak attempts to scare you with the Flashback scenes are worse than those used in the comedic shows of the 1980s and will eventually leave you wanting to hit your head against the wall of your home.
