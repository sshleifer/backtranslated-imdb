Nothing in this funny film. I thought that the premise, which is to give human libido in a horny ram, was interesting and must provide some laughs. Error! There is simply nothing funny about the film. For example, the main character that you pass in the goat's heats in the middle of the farm yard is not funny, they limit obscenity. They are walking around with this film in one level, which is very funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere and anytime. The main character that does this with everything, everywhere, every time is also not funny. Becomes clich√©. <br /> <br /> I think Rob Schneider is acceptable in this role. This means that he is not a bad representative, but with a corrupt material that is difficult to comment on quality. However, Colin Haskell, the other half of the romantic human horse (does one count the number of animals that care about her main character as a romantic leader too?), Seems awkward of everything, as well as should be. They seem to act in a kind of vacuum, separate from all other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to be bored of tasteless, boring and repetitive material.
