I saw him yesterday at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. Before going I came here to see how they were classified, and at that time was 7.4, it was a nice rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to go out (I never did this), but I was embarrassed to do so Because the movie producer was in the screen. <br /> <br /> I did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and do not lead anywhere, the characters are thicker than the dialog boxes, nothing leads anywhere, and the worst and worst: lots of Siemens and Organics advertise the movie. Although I have already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character who speaks on the Internet and Siemens appeared on the mobile phone all the time on her laptop. Or another person bathe or cut her hair just to show the Organics shampoo dramatically on the screen! All this would be possible if the plot, characters and romances were nothing good, but it was bad, and really bad! "Do not know how to do" sex in the city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
