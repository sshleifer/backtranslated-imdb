Back in my days as a prelude to "special lessons" I played at 4 plex I was working. It was a sleepy blow that sells Friday and Saturday nights for weeks. I have never seen it, but I saw that it was on the cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a chance. What I saw during the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, which made me feel very uncomfortable watching. <br /> <br /> The main story is a lustful teenage boy after his sensational maid (Sylvia Kristel). She too, seems to feel attractive towards the boy but for more sinister reasons. So we get the boy watches watching her undress and invite her to see him. And he goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, should be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His "frightening" reactions every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she is touched is horrific. I did not laugh once during this unwanted piece. <br /> <br /> We will not begin with the sub-plot of the servant and the driver who plans to extort money from the child. Let's just say that it involves forging death, burying the body .... I can continue, but it becomes more absurd. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older then he looked, but the truth looked like a child. He seems to have no idea how to kiss a woman (if that's behaving, I might have to rethink my criticism of Brown) and she has come close to approaching child pornography. I did not stop practicing the sex scene at all, although Miss Kristel is beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I must mention the last scene. For me it is quite sick but I can remember that the audience was cheering while freezing the movie and turning it into credits. Our hero returns to school and starts courting a teacher. He asks her about dinner and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise asked her out. She nodded as he walked away smiling the victorious camera. Give me a break! Yes, I am sure that teachers everywhere will risk everything for a easily looking teen child. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal that this film received in 1982. Surely it was more nudity because there was a lot of teenage sex comedy with nudity being bombed at the box office. And think that these same teenagers who made fun of this film 22 years ago are now working in corporate ladders and may be helping manage this country. This is a scary thought.
