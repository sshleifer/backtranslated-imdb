I found that writing in this movie is very awesome. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from me is its rating as one out of 10 is the performance of Lacey Chappert who thought he played multiple characters really well. For me it was definitely the highlight of this film. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was as beautiful as she always is but she found her role very nice, so I do not think one could say that her acting was wonderful. <br /> <br /> For the male bullet, Armand Assante, I was reminded of the role of the doctors in the series of cheese hospitals in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> All this I could have lived with. But the end / terrible, terrible, terrible, psychological and even psychological role were just some of the worst writings I've seen in a long time.
