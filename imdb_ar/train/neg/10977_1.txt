I live in Ottawa where this film was produced and I really wish it was not. This is one God flick. I actually try to support independent films but there is a stain associated with anything independent, and this stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to throw this damn. Actor, writer and director Brett Kelly does not do much to contribute to this genre; it re-divides the cliches from past films. I'm really fed up with the threat of the evil characters that lie in the shadows and obscure the ambiguity, it's way too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I can remember one scene in particular near the end of the click, where the entire scene shines with the headlights. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but unfortunately the budget was showing volatility in this film. As for the film, which it dares to frighten, the viewer will find himself squeezed hard to find any real jar, except for some scenes containing corn syrup and red food coloring. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that pulls this film down is the speed and lack of personal development, the basic plot is that the children are kidnapped and the parents must follow this Bonesetter colleague ahead of time in order to recover their children. This concept does not bother me, but I did not find it really reasonable that when the two main characters, each of them could have lost children to find time to beat each other. This is done in a short time so unimaginable, my first priority is to restore my daughter and at least identify the lady before going out with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is .... I will not face this against Kelly, but the film is filmed entirely on a dull, passionate video, which really takes no tense moments and will only be oozed on the film. Although if the movie was given a $ 1 million arrangement, redesigning the story and boring and lame representation, nothing would keep the film standing. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a supplement, reported on his website, a half-written supplement in one session. <br /> <br /> The Lord helped us all.
