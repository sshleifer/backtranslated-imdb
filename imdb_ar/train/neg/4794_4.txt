Why did they see this? There is only one reason for the greatness of John Saxon. I love his work. My favorite features are Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3, 7 Nancy's Cap as a policeman and Black Christmas as a policeman and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I was looking through my local video outlet, I saw Zombie Death House and quickly shot it but before I finished it, I noticed that John Saxon was not only represented in the film, but for the first time I ever saw it, I heard about the director. This intrigued me (also cheap price $ 9.00) and I and I must have it. On my return to the house, I realized that this film did not live up to the level of other Saxon works even if it was acting, which may be confused by additional output pressures. But he was not only the other actors who were also sucked. It was as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porn exchange and told the players now that you should do so. The film seems even of the quality of porn 80. I can not in good faith to recommend this film to unusual viewers, but if you are a fan of the obsessed 1980s who missed the culture that came from that era through their late birth, who is this . Also if you dig John Saxon as I do.
