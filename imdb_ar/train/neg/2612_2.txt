The only reason I have seen is 101 Dalmatians is his nominations for the original song design and costumes for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than admiring this film. In this sequel, DeVil Cruella (by the way Glenn closes this role very well) is released from the hospital because of its good behavior. She loves all kinds of animals and closes all her fur. From that point, just wait until the crisis begins. Soon after, she is doing and trying to make the best coat for the world of fashion, of course for herself and the magnificent Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glenn Close, I found that all characters are very silly but from a funny baby eye. That's fair enough because his target market is, I think, children under 12 years old. It's good entertainment for kids and families, but it did not do much for me. * Away from the place *****
