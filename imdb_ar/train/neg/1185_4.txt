There is another difference and improvisation in the story of the famous and beloved children, La Bete (1975), also known as The Beast, trying to imagine it (in a very graphic and what may seem humiliating and annoying but actually in a silly and comedic way). What happened between beauty and the beast? I feel entertained by many comments and comments that seem to be looking deeply into this film. I will not go further by saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of subjects such as sexual frustration, longing, satisfaction or cynical criticism of Catholic faith. I would not even call it a horror film. It's more than a parody of all kinds that touch it or remember it, although it got some horrible moments in all the departments that will definitely remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long (very long) scene between the aristocratic and horrifying young woman is supposed to be the most laughable I've ever seen in a truly impressive film creature ... A good dissection, tuned to the stunning Scarletti music which is hysterical. My husband and I laughed loudly at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The significance of the scene is - Beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the film? For the dramatic picture, it's too long; for a technical film - it contains a lot of comic scenes of sheer madness and a sudden ending. IMO, the filmmaker was not a serious drama. As a spoof of house art / horror / erotica, it is funny and certainly original. Laugh well and try not to look for a deep meaning. Surely, this strange beauty story and these lovable monsters are not recommended for children. The opening scene, which could shock a less-prepared viewer than the notorious Behemia scene, could be used successfully on the Discovery Channel for a show like "In the Animal World - Mating Habits and Horse Rituals."
