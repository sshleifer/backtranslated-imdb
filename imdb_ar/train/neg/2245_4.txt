This film is not the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and this is a shame because the 1954 version, in my opinion, is much better. I do not deny Barbara Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and a great singer. I'm not familiar with Chris Christoferson's other work, so I can not judge her. However, this film leaves much to be desired. Slowly walking, with nudity and foul language undue, it can be very difficult to sit in. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a rock fan, so naturally I just want to. Judy Garland's version is better. Watch the 1976 film with Barbara and Chris, and judge yourself.
