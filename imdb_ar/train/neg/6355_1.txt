I could not wait to see this movie. About half way through the film, I could not wait until it was over. All the actors (white) were giving up their lines like Woody Allen just said, "Say so ..." They then said their lines were on the screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was very annoying. We all know how Veril will really talk, not finding his words like Mr. Allen. The comic part of this film was equally boring and certainly not funny or even amusing. I must admit that I have never been a fan of Woody Allen, and this film certainly did not make me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This film will be reduced as one of the 10 worst films I have ever seen.
