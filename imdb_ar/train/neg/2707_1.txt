This is one of the most rotten films of the 1990s. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This image depicts African-Americans as sociologists, monsters, non-cultured, violent and non-energetic. The Fudge (Ice Cube) and its homies do not always respect others in the home, not only white people, but also Asians, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all this tolerance, they continue to moan and cry over the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact, the effect of Fudge is that makes Remmy intertwine with the skinheads, leaving the kidney, and eventually killing the owner's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Headers are presented in the form of a covert group of retirees who take a bounce off campus and generally go away from anyone else. They never blew up their music to annoy people or make fun of the police. They commit a serious crime such as battery and rape, but they are not hateful or threatened like Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There are a lot of articles in this movie that have almost been misused to me or made me giggle. Here are some of the information below. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are described as students at Columbus University, yet we never see them in class and it is not entirely clear how they pay tuition. Only one is left to speculate that the herbs they smoke have to do with their financial affairs. Although they are students at a private university, they can not pronounce one line of appropriate English. Their characters are developed only through compulsive whining and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> Kristen Swanson (Christie Swanson) seems to have known exactly why the drunken Billy took her home. I even asked him to get the rubber so they could start. The fact is that he broke through without a male condom while it would be nice to have sex only if it was useful. Later, Tarien (Jennifer Connelly) Christine confirmed that she bore no responsibility in this regard, and despite the deliberate jump into the man's bed, she was not ready for sex, and had exploited her with sexual predatory brutality. Then after a week or so, she met a very sensitive delicate growth she knew how to avoid rape and bring condoms. The director stressed the contraception completely. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and the ultimate garbage that makes blacks look like thieves and women who look stupid and weak. Cole Hoosser's and Lawrence Vishburn's tone is the only reason I can think of seeing it. It is clear that the writer / director is a man of limited intelligence. Keep watching yourself if you want to, but keep in mind that neurons do not grow again. Just follow the tips in the end and ignore.
