Luckily I did not pay for this film. Also, I can not even detect any spoilers because I willingly left forty minutes after the film. That was bad. I laughed once, when Yahoo! The plate fell on the man, the theme song came. However, it was only because I thought he was making fun of it, but then I realized it was after another placement of the product. <br /> <br /> I liked the animation. I used to see him almost religiously. (Although I missed the last episode.) I heard she showed Dr. Chloe and was no more than a claw, someone attached to the show page) the animation had a much more benign and brine than the film, regarding this point. I hated setup for everything, Robocop reminds us. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of the tool inspector. It's not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon. Another fact is that his tools are working as far as I have seen, except for the oil slick. He also screwed up with the tone "Wowsers" that were in an excited tone. I was very disappointed because they slaughtered the carton severely. Everyone felt that way too. Our children aged 14-17 remember our cartoons with admiration and loved every minute of them. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie with an open mind, knowing that they were drunk with animation. I was surprised how the film was delayed. It was based on sight gags, stupid dialogue of humor. Disney relies on the pain and physical humor of a movie for children. The placement of the product is meaningless in this film, and this shows. The wise car is not good at cracking wisdom. The tools looked nice, but they were almost glossy. The carton had a better look. The silly scenes were foolish. In 40-45 minutes I watched the film, heard no laughter, and laughed at the preview of Dudley du Wright. This movie should not be seen by people who want intelligence in family entertainment. I highly recommend The Iron Giant, which was sad, but very good. This film is a farce for the whole family drama
