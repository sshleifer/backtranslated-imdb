How unfortunate, I have a lot of my "a" list, and the good actors on the "b" list agree to do this, but they did, and that's what prompted me to watch it. I have never heard of this film, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. directly on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background to what extent could it be bad? In a very word! This film starts with some twists and turns, then puts an egg. The end was very weak, as if the writer had summoned him and his 4-year-old son was sitting on the genre clerk and broke the end. How ridiculous it is for a film called "The End Game" that you have such a poor. These are the types of movies that can move the "a" list representatives to the "b" list in a hurry. I hope that Cuba is not usually Gooding JR, James Woods of the habit.
