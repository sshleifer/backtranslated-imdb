This was the first Iwan McGregor film I saw outside Star Wars. Since then I have become one of the biggest fans of Iwan McGregor, but I still can not forgive myself for having this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a great fan of Jane Austen, and that's why she has been exposed to many of the classics, Emma being one of them. I've always considered them annoying, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible rendition, I had to admit that the original Emma was exhilarating and charming. Ewan McGregor hardly serves a purpose in this film after they broke and smeared the Frank Churchill part. Gwyneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is remarkable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone interested remotely is in the English period period ... Go to see the originals. If you are a fan of McGregor Ewan ... Believe me, by skipping this movie, I did not miss anything except his five minutes collective in a silly hat and a bad hair story.
