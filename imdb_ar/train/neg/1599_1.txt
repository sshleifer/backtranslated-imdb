The LAMPOON CLASS REUNION national game was lagging when it was released. It was not long in theaters in my big city. why? Because it's bad !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painless way. The entire group of actors was mostly unknown and remained unknown after Turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea was really great (a parody of jagged jokes) but the implementation is not very much on each side. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending nanoseconds watching this embarrassing embezzlement.
