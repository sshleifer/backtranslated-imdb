I've been using IMDb for years and never wanted to participate in movie commentary? Until now. This documentary contains many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic studies expert, but I know enough to shed some light on the one-sided view adopted by this documentary. <br /> <br /> The problems of this film begin with the fact that it is a documentary film. Most of the documentaries I have seen are based on some valid points and then surround these points with misleading and misleading interpretations. This is certainly the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, some of whom are Muslims, but building a documentary about Islam around a small percentage of extremist people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary film about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who want to explore some of the issues in this documentary more objectively, here are some points that might help you. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside the region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> Translation of the Koran used in the documentary translated. I watched the documentary while watching another translation and the differences were striking. I was warned of the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. Navel 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Sura says the infidels will go to hell. But the translation I read instead: "Those who reject the truth between the people of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in hell." The difference is that those who reject the truth are those who know God and the truth of God and decide to reject Him anyway. <br /> <br /> The film stated that there is no inherent morality in Islam, but this is not true. Although much of the Qur'an and Hadith are true, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf" or "normative behavior". Clearly, normative can be interpreted in several ways, but "Urf" is meant to be "good" behavior, which the average person may consider right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary shows "Sharia" as a unified entity of knowledge followed by all Muslims. This is simply not true. There are many schools of Islamic law ranging from progressive and modern to fundamentalist in the interpretation of the law. <br /> <br /> Tradition is similar. There are thousands of conversations, and every school of rights accepts some and rejects others. Using Talk without a serious grant to determine which is accurate, real and applicable, is a random selection and selection of quotations from a date that suits what you want to say? That's what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people will realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on. I know that this is not the same suicide bombing, only realized that extremism is the problem. If you feel like you have an answer, everyone should be wrong. But if you feel you have an answer, you can work with the opinions of others about politics, religion, God or anything else.
