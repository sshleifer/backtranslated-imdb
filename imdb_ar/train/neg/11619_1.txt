I watched the whole movie, waiting for something to happen. Maybe it is my fault to anticipate evil and terror rather than psychology? Is it a strange recount of the Odibal myth: I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and create a musical play with him? I did not understand why there were some elements of the plot: why was the top floor of the building, why was there that big staircase with an ideal place for someone to be punished if no one actually would, why are there scenes at all with the father at work, Why do you have such a nice kitchen if you will eat food just outside the house, and why the boy wants to baptize and the parents are the ones who resist rather than vice versa. I see a lot of good reviews of this film ... Have my tastes been damaged by increasing the number of films from the 1970s and old science fiction films?
