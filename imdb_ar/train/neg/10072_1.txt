Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the cinema to watch this shallow film meaningless. My point is; <br /> <br /> The film depends on two things. <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic View: As in most American films, the author thinks himself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. Unfortunately, this is not enough. Knowing kunefe and two other food names does not make a person understand the culture. For example shaving is a sign of clean life in Asia, but everyone was trying the girl to stop it. The Lebanese are Christians (well, they did not) and their forms, cultural beliefs and styles are quite different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not make ethnic centralism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our lives as the father did in every film. <br /> <br /> 2) A sexual revolution for a girl: There is nothing to be said about this. Show me 10 girls have more in their sexual health than I would say I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please see Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. Black humor must reflect the truth and focus the audience on the ridiculous parts of it. where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film.
