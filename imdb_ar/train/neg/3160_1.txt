You know you're having trouble watching comedy, when only the parts are full of Animal crew. It is unfortunate that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support and not vice versa, because humans were very bad all the time. <br /> <br /> If you are Paul, Eva, Lake (any kind of name), Jason, and Lindsay, I would forget this camouflage camouflage and do something else, because you are all funny like watching dry paint, horrible actors to boot . <br /> <br /> The main muzzle in the film is one of the characters who scream, I'm not gay, which is funny as if you were not, you can change your mind if you have to deal with three bosses, boring and dare to say very ordinary women Perform in the film. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years, and hope not to see anyone bad again, although I do not expect it.
