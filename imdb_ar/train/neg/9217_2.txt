Yes, the only thing memorable for this film is that he starred young Tom Hanks, who was only a few years later a related star in Hollywood. Although it is not a film that shows his talents much at all, and the only other thing that can be considered a bit fun about this click is the scene where he thinks he sees monsters and runs a young man. Yes, this film revolves around the evils of playing a game that make a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, there is a special after-school type about the evils of the game of fortified towers and dragonflies that are cleverly named here as mazes and monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film believed that obsessed people should not enjoy any kind unless they would go out and practice alcohol without legal age, drugs, unprotected sex and harassment of weaker children just like all famous children. No, these wicked people were playing a game that actually requires the use of one of them, no paradise! Not this, if they have a brain they may actually be able to think for themselves and not wash their brains by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and time consuming. Granted, it could be a film against addiction, but there are far fewer people who died as they took fortified towers and dragons to their fullest extent than to say what the drunk leadership claims in a month.
