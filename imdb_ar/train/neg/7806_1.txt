Poor Michael Madsen has to kick himself to find out that people have discovered about this terrible flick. I really can not think of anything worse I've seen, except amateur porn. This is bad, and everything here; wooden representation, bad writing, crazy moral end, hate it and it is in this film. At least we could have seen Virginia's sister Michael naked in a scene, but I do not think this would save this stink ... <br> /> <br /> For a wonderful man making some extraordinary movies, I want to know what the church is foolishly sponsoring this piece of crapola.
