I was very excited to see that they made a movie of my favorite book at all. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was amazed at the many omissions of important parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a film from the fourth-grade book report on the novel. Meg did well in school and did not wear her nor her father's glasses. Ms. Murray (Meg's mother) was never portrayed as a scientist; they left her kitchen laboratory and replaced him with the Internet. And this is just the beginning. In the middle of the film, I found myself screaming on the screen, which aroused great alarm from the other people who were watching the film and who did not read the book. I wish I had more thumb so I could give four thumbs up for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for someone who has not read the book, this movie is quite fine.
