Who wrote this? Someone named John Cohen. I think this was his first scenario. Someone should tell him that you are supposed to write a dialog that looks like something someone might already say. <br /> <br /> Who directed this? Scott Marshall? The son of Jerry Marshall. My nut fell off the tree. Maybe someone wanted to let him know that you could actually shoot a scene in a New York taxi, and it would look real, and you would not have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. He may also want to tell him that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but we hope he has learned this lesson now. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson ... Naturally she can not act. It's hell, making Jessica Alba look like Audrey Hepburn, yet she's starring in this film. Oh wait, it was produced by her father. Well, that's why she got the part. That's the only reason I think about it. <br /> <br /> So, should I be surprised that it's bad? No, will I be surprised at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would have seen as many of them as I saw. I mean, you expect a movie from Jessica Simpson to be bad, but that's not just bad, it's the opposite of a classic film. Think of the wonderful Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as this good movie. It is the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy because I did not pay for it, I stopped watching for 10 minutes at a cus I could not continue. No doubt I had come out of the theater sooner. In fact, I wonder how many of the six people who saw him in every theater have already stayed and watched everything. The film begins very badly, then goes so badly that it becomes a kind of Chinese torture with water. Then, when the first chapter ends, you realize that it will get worse, and that's when you need to either leave, or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film falls within the category because it is too bad to be used instead of riding water at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer to ride the water.
