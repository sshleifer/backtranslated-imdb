I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And despite the laugh of my ass in the jokes, I do not think this film was so bad. Sure, it was a bit difficult to understand that it was clearly low budget, but it had a very Hitchcock-like plot and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MST3K version, I was already enjoying it. This movie screams for a remake of Hollywood.
