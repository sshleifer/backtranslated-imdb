First, there is no place near other Sci-Fi fluids; that does not mean that Grindel is a good film, in fact, it's very bad, but it certainly was probably much better. The drawbacks of the film come from personal, personal, and silly additions to the story, visual effects, music, and the bulk: acting. <br /> <br /> When talking about character design, I, of course, mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes like the funny Vikings, instead of the brute-force warriors, seem to be wearing the helmet of our main hero wearing a very silly. Grendel looks like a skeleton but with strange claws attachments to his elbows. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from start to finish, yet Finn - the useless owner - has achieved some dimensions, thanks to his romantic sub-plot, and Unferth gets some idea as well, because he becomes less cocky. <br /> <br /> Like the Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it own, while still clinging to the source material. The talented bow for Beowulf is very ridiculous, and I am surprised that the cast has not moved away from the group. Besides additions, there are omissions, such as the core themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> Special effects are terrible. Grindel and his mother Hagg are ill-conceived, and as such, their portrayals on the screen are less than believable. <br /> <br /> The music is arrogant, especially when the character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst film in science fiction yet. No, it's actually one of the best movies, although it's still in the trash mode, but it's no good, making it fun guilty at best. The only thing that works is dialogue, which is still woody here and there. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended to skip this film and to watch Robert Zemikis's film about Beowulf's old story, simply because this film is only half the story, and not everything, which got a three-star review.
