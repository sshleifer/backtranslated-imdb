Some people might say something like "Baby Geniuses" with his giant robotic children or "Dumbo" with a narcotic psychedelic nightmare sequence that would win the most disturbing film award of children's making. You might say that too, but you'll be wrong. And here, to come to you: Santa Claus, the most impulsive family movie ever since ... well, never. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes that show children from all over the world singing their indistinct songs (seriously, this band is about 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the chart!) Conclusion that Merlin emanates from outta anywhere And save the day (do not mind, it's Barcelona), this is the shock of childhood at its best. No matter how hard you try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I'm just ... I can not ... get ... those ... reindeer animals ... laugh ... out of. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid the mind-boggling piece of junk as if you were avoiding a sex-hungry whale during the mating season. However, if the flaming gay devils infected with a serious case of excessive flu is something to you, I think you should try it. But in fact, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
