This film seemed to be entertaining and fun to describe. But for me it was a bit of a let down. Too slow and difficult to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the director took individual pieces of the film and threw them into the air and made them share whatever the way they landed (certainly not sequentially). Also, none of the result was filmed. I have seen a good number of different Korean films and noticed that a good part is well made and requires some thought from the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one puzzled me endlessly. I watched the movie for the second and third time and still did nothing to me. I still do not really understand what the director was trying to convey. If the goal is to show only a normal part of a person's life, I think he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
