I saw the mother ... Well, she did not accept Santa Claus completely; he put his hand on her thighs and evil thoughts in mind. <br /> <br /> This was enough to scare a passionate boy who wanted to believe in him. He grew up to be a bitter man disturbed by the quality of the games being made, and the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> I expected to flick a real shiver, I was very disappointed that I was less than a handful. Of people die, and there was no nudity at all. What a problem. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this click, but it was too slow and did not have a good text. I did not expect a great representation, but I definitely wanted to do some action. There was not any.
