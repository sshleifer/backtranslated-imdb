I do not know why this behavior was tolerated in the field of cinema! This film (short) is gross (to say the least)! She is a handful of children aged 5-7 years wearing diapers with large pins, like adults (and very many!). However, it's interesting because it's a good example of how "old days" are probably not good after all! (Thank God, we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This short one from Shirley Temple Festival}
