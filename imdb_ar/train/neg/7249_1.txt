This film is competing with "Plan 9" as one of the dumbest films ever made. Always be concerned when the person himself is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Outlet 3. Product 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Crenbrink did all six jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were "tricky men" in the West. So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example of the film: In the film, Sharif must take a certificate to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys are discovering and waiting for them. But what happens? Good men ride the bell and shoot a tree near them. When our camera shows the bad guys, they all just sit on a record, chatting. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I can continue. This movie was supposed to be a comedy. If so, they did not do it too well.
