When I saw this film, I could not believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures, dustbin dolls with big pointed teeth, really mean to be scary? Or where they are designed to laugh well (I sincerely hope so). If you watch carefully, you can even see the strings you're working on (best; drag them across the screen). It was all more funny than scary, and I had a good time watching the film because I was amazed at its inability to get just one good part. It's one big joke from start to finish, and I think this movie belongs to a new category: therefore, the laughter will remain unreasonable from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on acting or all other things)
