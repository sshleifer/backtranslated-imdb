This is a simple story but it feels very manipulative. It lacks a pathetic because it leaves no room for imagination, personal thinking or time to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but I feel it is very accidental. You'd better get more pictures from behind, and have more space in the background, and maybe you will not feel this is quiet for me. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie, it works well but is very derivative of Aardman's movies and this bothers me. Maybe a longer film will test whether this product can dispense sound. <br /> <br /> I think the sound is over.
