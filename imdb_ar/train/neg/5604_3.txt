I heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it. Mass killings of fans fans in 1963 and 1969 ultimately caused the closure of the camp to encourage. Bambi, a former student, opens a backup of new recruits, including Candy (Carole Keane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold), and Sandy (Debreley Scott). One by one, they are killed by the killer, so only one remains. Then we discover who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the film, Tom Smithers makes a terrible hymn as a mountain Canadian, and Paul Robbins plays Piet-Wee Herman. The plot was not developed in general well, and very lame, but some funny scenes occur, namely House of Bad Pies and Induction poker scene. The end seems to be thrown together, and this is shameful. <br /> <br /> In general, good for ten minutes or fifteen minutes, and the rest you can only progress quickly. Maybe you can catch them on TV, but they are not worth buying.
