I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the film is that in some parts it makes you think for a short while about the spiritual theme, sophistication, sincerity and your role in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film breaks easily and there is very little connection between the scenes and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in the release of this film. Events that were supposed to show honesty occur almost unrecognizable. A lot of thought has to be done in order for the viewer to see that the scene refers to chance, and even to imagine more that it has to do with larger purposes. <br /> <br /> Enlightenment enlightenment scenes do not create a better sense of being supposed to be. Do you remember Enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in the Little Buddha)? Well, that's something like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are a lot of scenes that do not work on story development nor do they help create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film, especially Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jurgen Brusno, can not. Save it. It seems that the first 2 has got more scenes from her characters in an attempt to save the movie, and because they got more pay, but that does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and the story does not help at all. <br /> <br /> Jurgen is good at watching him and selling as a villain (as always), but the script does not help him at all. The scene that first tries to persuade John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad scenario. Execution of the scene when he dies in a very bad explosion. You can not even comment on previous videos throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great medium for time, read the book! I have not read it, but maybe better than a billion times, it should be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment on IMDb.
