Unless you are mentally ill or more deeply sympathetic, you will tire of this heinous excuse for a film in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Plot - Even for Seagal, the plot is stupid. I mean, it's not only bad, it's barely coherent. <br /> <br /> Representation - incredibly wooden. Literally looks best acting in porno. Ironically this film tries to benefit from this audience "Lesbian Love Scene" worth it. <br /> <br /> Special effects - will not appear in the movie "The sword and the magic theft" in the sixties. <br /> <br /> Unless you are suffering from insomnia and exhausting all other treatments, do not make the same mistake as you did and purchase this DVD, asking for that hour and a half of your life again. .
