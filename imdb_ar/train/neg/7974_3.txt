It's interesting at first. A naive guard in the park (Colin Firth) marries a mysterious beautiful woman (Lisa Zani) whom she has known for a short time. They seem happy, and then disappear without warning. He looks for her, and after a few ends, stumbles on some of her abused childhood and her near-lean past, which may include criminal activity. After that, it seems that the directors did not know what to do with the story. The starters, although not as impressive as they seem, are at least watchable. Then it stops to be interesting or even make a big sense. The result is very lame, too boring, and devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the scriptwriter did not know what they were doing and tried to get bored. What a waste of a good idea!
