All I can really say is that I am happy because I loved you socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry with the loss of two hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious and my husband and I laughed loud. I highly recommend this movie to people who want to make their own copy of MST3K.
