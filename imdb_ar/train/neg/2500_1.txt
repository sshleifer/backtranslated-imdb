Van Dien must be embarrassed by the memory of this ridiculously poor film, and everyone involved should be involved. To be honest I am embarrassed to admit that I saw him from beginning to end. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original series of Crossroads and Prisoner Cell Block H. Most of the five-year-olds will be able to come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more logical plot. For presentations, if you can imagine the most pornographic movies you've ever seen - one of those events where the game is filled with some endless "story" to explain how some old boilers of blonde peroxide have become spit-roasting a few blocks with mustaches - you'll have An idea of ​​the level of representation in the "virgin journey". Worse still, you can not even progress quickly to sex scenes, because there is none of them. Awesome horror film.
