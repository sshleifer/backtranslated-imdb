Anurag Basu, who co-directed KUCCH TO HAI, appeared for the first time in this film <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time, although it contains a story that is no different from each other. It has come close to HAWAS, One week ago, fortunately, this was better and done better. <br /> <br /> The film starts well, Malika's comet appears well at first although the scene with Emraan-Malika is very strange / tacky /> <br /> The viewer is treated between Faith and Malikah well and twisting the story where Ashmeth faces a wonderful faith <br /> <br /> The pace moves fast and the viewer remains on the edge but the second is the path of a friend of Faith Is not quite convincing <br /> <br /> It also seems that the path of the cop is half baked <br /> <br /> The end is very filthy too <br /> <br /> Anurag Basu is a good music winner, , And the camera work was amazing <br /> <br /> Emraan played his naughty line very well, and that was the role he gave stardom and although he continued to play these roles and got annoyed in this film was fantastic, where Ashmith was good at His role was one-time, he did a great job and one of his only good performances and he looked good too. Malika was wonderful in her role in the second half of the year but did not deliver the request sometimes up to the mark unfortunately rarely showed this potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is fine
