What's wrong with this film? Many, many things. The adjustment tries to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer while also giving it a strong headache. The plot is confusing and clearly extended to what began as a short story or film. The plot makes a good short story for less than ten minutes, and the story has stretched so painful that it has reached the minimum length of a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we provide them, do not we? exactly. They become thinner. In the end, the chart is so thin that you might miss it, if you do not care, which is difficult to do when watching this movie. Acting is not even a little moving. The characters are written bad and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things in this film is that apparently, whoever was responsible for the result / sound recording had no idea what the film was about, or what it was supposed to be about (and not that I blame it, I could not "t" Also, what was with all the sexual tones between Eliza Dushko and the main character? Of course, this was in order to attract young males, but was done cheaply. Does the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film, at any conceivable level? They had nothing to do with the film, they were there just to get some chase scenes ... I doubt that anyone would really enjoy a very bad film and such a horrible Hollywood-like attempt to some fairly interesting idea, but I digress. Low-minded people who do not mind raising a really bad horror as long as there is some sex and fatigue in it (although this may be true only in the Killer Cut film that I saw).
