Wonderful! This movie is really wonderful. I can not imagine how anyone could read this poorly written text and give it the green light. The cast rate is uniformly second with some really horrible performances of almost all cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. Hate, lead and predictability. No wit, no charm, no teaser. Not sexy at least. The figures are still flat like pie pie. There is also a strong stream of dislike that has become increasingly difficult in the stomach with the continuation of the film. When your leadership (Karel) is unfamiliar and unattractive it is arduous from there. Although the false rotation ends where love triumphs over lust, it leaves me feeling sick in my stomach. If this is up to humor and social commentary then we are definitely doomed.
