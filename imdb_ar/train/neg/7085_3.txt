I really tried to love this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, because of non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, alien, nervous), jeopardizes his marriage, his job and even his life. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are terrible. Mainly representation. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are in very bad taste and you might think you are watching a house-made flick. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot is not just a sensation. How can such a smart and beautiful wife bear all the bad things of the husband? How can you believe it ?! Triple position is invaluable and will make you laugh for a while. <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with the black theater theater attendant is useless and will make you think of "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like these will find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; it is not a soft foundation, it is not a documentary document, not an exciting feature. It's a tonic effort to call it the so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's legs are displayed. I held it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not return.
