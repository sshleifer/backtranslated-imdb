Despite some original touches from time to time, such as "virtual collections" that provide a background on Victorian interior designs that show Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film is short and ultimately disappointing. The newcomer Francesca Ferdinandi seems talented, but is lost as Amy, a character that is curtailed in the middle of the film to just stare at the screen you see Ada Adri Troy's biography. Ada Concepting Ada begins briefly when Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera continues to express its facial expressions and behaviors, and even makes it appear transparent or invisible for a moment, divided into scenes to film Amy's "virtual" show. <br /> <br /> A clear autobiography by Ada Lovelace will be interesting, but this film, sadly, makes the lives of Ms. Ada, the contemporary computer scientist (and her full-fledged friend).
