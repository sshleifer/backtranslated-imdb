This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I looked at it mainly out of curiosity because I loved the novel, and I wish I did not. I stopped him after less than an hour, although I wanted to stop him after five minutes. I wish I had. The novel largely ignores and changes all kinds of factors. Unless the film can recover itself within the last 50 minutes or so (which would be impossible), I would not recommend this in any way. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. I do not think, as many people say, that "bell bell" is necessarily unbreakable, but this particular recognition could have been done without it. I would like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it in a fair way.
