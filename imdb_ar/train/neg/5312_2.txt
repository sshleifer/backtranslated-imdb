Usually a terrible garbage from the director Fred Olin Rai about the fisherman of Cyborg (Teagan) commissioned by Warren Martin and Michael Vincent to find and execute a foreign alien runaway Ross Hagen who charted the course of the Earth. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxious university children led by the grubby Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his sheep on a subversive journey. Soon, Cyborg will explode away by the arm that burns an innocent doctor called alcohol (Robert Quarry of the Count of Georgia-Vampire) to prove that no one will stand on his way to recover the convict's hide, which is surrounded by a tracer that weakens his body. Lou finds an ally in Leo Gordon, a Vietnam Veteran Veteran with weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> It may have been made with terrible intent, and this is characterized by the cravings of "Alien Cinema" fans - the effects, the representation, and the hypothesis. At least, the film contains PJ Soles for some eye candy. Even in 89, she was completely smoking. Sure, this laser gun is funny. It can burn some houses even when Cyborg fires the law, it barely leaves a mark on the site being launched.
