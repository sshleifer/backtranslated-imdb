Not bad but also not too big steal the film. Kirk Douglas is recently released from the safe prison who, after refusing a offer from Mob, decided to withdraw the job himself. He is a circus recruiter for gymnast Juliano Gemma. The chaos ensues. Douglas and Gima soon found themselves in the midst of the truly love triangle with Florence's impeccable friend, Florinda Bolk√°n. Director Michelle Lobo keeps pace with moving fast, and there is at least one excellent and innovative developer sequence that includes Puppo & Gemma. Although the Italian production, it seems that most of the film has been in Germany. Douglas is fine, not only landing in Giallo a quick hit. Polkan's eye-catching performance gives a wonderful performance. The music is written by Inio Moricon and filmed by the great artist Tonino Deli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Fermolier and Fellini to Bassolini and Leon).
