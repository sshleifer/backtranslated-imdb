Cash (now played with Angelina Jolie Khrystyne in the Angelina Jolie) wandered to the barren land after the end of the world (after her governor died from old age, she said the garrison played Elias Cotias, a respectable real actress) and now find that people wandering in rubble looking for cyborgs for metal trade Scrap and cash. She leads a group of burning cyborgs (including William Katt and Evan Lurie and a human world played by Zach Galligan) against the hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 can not be better than other entries, but it is still a very boring feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used well, that sequences of procedures are routine and little names are given, such as McDowell, Katt, and Galligan. Haje is a fantastic heroine, Lynch has gone beyond the upper part (as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be so bad as his favorite predecessor. (One with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which strongly resists any good idea they have. Since this is a routine procedure and B-movie numbers are efficiently manufactured, this is the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 - (Poor)
