It looked like it would be better than it was. The filming was good, the acting seemed solid, and the dialogue was not very harsh ... but after about twenty minutes of this long scene with a doctor who already knows a patient in the asylum pretends to be a doctor - he goes south from there. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the devil revolves around the finest forms of hell because of the appearance of Godzilla in Satan's curse. There are also some strange worshipers wearing masks resembling teenagers who have been exploding since the start of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, filming could not save this movie. Despite some powerful presentations by actors, the story does not go anywhere. I think the word "Hellbored" was a better title for this.
