When I was a kid, I remember seeing this during my visit to one of our friends at Phil. We are back! The story of dinosaurs is a silly cartoon about dinosaurs called Rex (expressed by the wonderful John Goodman). Tells the story of a small dinosaur about the story of the return of dinosaurs to live on Earth. He explains that it was part of the thing that brought them back, with some friends. Doctor / Professor Evil of this film, I think he may have been responsible for their return, but I do not care about him. Children may like it, but personally it is just cheesy. John Goodman may have been the only decent thing. poor!
