"Malcom's offer of FOX really kills ... can not we do our own version?" I guess and rephrase it, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and the only thing NBC has added to the Malcom scale is sex. And boy, have they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thacker, 13, gets Bonner and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally stuck his aunt in the bathroom and accused him of watching and beating her. He spies on the nice girl in the next door from the window of his bedroom. She knows he wants to see her naked, but she bothers him by smiling and closing the window. That's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from puberty - Boy boy is very crazy and perseverance on the testicle and it is impossible to be fun for a popular audience. The only times anyone approached were in movies, you can count on them by hand. So it is not surprising that "Tucker" has the warmth and attractiveness of the strip club bath. Did the network really think we would like to see children wrestling with puberty? Are not these the things that people go to prison for? If you suspect that the show is being spoiled, consider: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled them after only 4 episodes; then they made the unprecedented move to "burn" the remaining episodes by broadcasting them in the middle of the night so that no children from See it. Ironic since the children were originally a target audience. <br /> <br /> Regardless of her general screams, Tucker has a constant voice from the leading character to poor writing. Even in 2000 it was terribly dated, with it's occasional ska music and super irony. I did not like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes were not up to exactly one minute ... Shame on NBC because of this dirty tear ... it's better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
