I love Brad Pitt very much. He is a representative with brains and intelligence, not to mention his face, chest and all that remains. Ever since I saw him in Thelma and Louise, I've had an idea, who reminds me? "Troy" did it for me. Is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious of course. Male, American, but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind. He is so beautiful that he is at his best when he plays against her. Kalifornia "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" makes it a self-denying sense of humor that makes it humane and almost accessible. Fortunately "Troy" will be forgotten soon. Only the still photos with the house, semi-naked in the charming enemy locations will adorn the walls of hordes of fans saliva. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing? Well, I think it would be very hard not to say the opportunity to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
