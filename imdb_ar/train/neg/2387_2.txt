I could not believe how lame and useless this was. Basically, there is nothing you can laugh at in the movie, and hardly any scenes attract your attention to the rest of the movie. This movie was pulled in some huge stars but all of them were lost in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must have taken some acting lessons after a few years of this film before staring at The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked simple and modest. Luckily, I got this movie at a very low price because it certainly is not a movie to remember for any good reason. I will not write anything about the film, but as you know, you are supposed to be the most famous contender around America because of her big thumbs. I will give this movie 2/10. Before I watch this movie, I was wondering why this film got only 4.0 / 10 and now I know why. Very disappointing film. Do not buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
