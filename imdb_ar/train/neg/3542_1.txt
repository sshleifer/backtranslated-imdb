After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write it for the first time. This film looks like Marmite has divided the audience. I must say that although I agree with the movies, it would not make sense to be fun (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), but they still have to involve you in characters. Now that I'm completely absorbed in the murderous sexual relationship in Lynch, I must say that I can not give up Mr. Green or other cardboard gangsters who inhabited this dialogal world. <br /> <br /> Also, while many people seem to be trying and saying that you did not enjoy it because you did not understand it, I would be different - I did not enjoy it because I was bored. I wanted to end the film and constantly listening to those quotes again and again did not help. Call it a smart name if you want it - I think it's repeated. <br /> <br /> However, the main reason for writing is to ask a question to all other reviewers - there were no final balances on the movie you saw. Only music on black. Have you seen a printed copy or is this evidence of a GR claim? Or did anyone who took part in the film secretly watch and remove his name ??
