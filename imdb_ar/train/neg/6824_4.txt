After I saw Koyaanisqatsi twice or twenty-three times and loved every second of them, I finally had the opportunity to see it as a sequel to Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed because it was hardly in line with the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their heads is not my idea for a good film. Philip Glass's result was not the beauty or strength associated with the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film looked slow and meaningless. A diluted version of the pond, which is the same idea but has been implemented better. I really hope they do not follow this third film in this series.
