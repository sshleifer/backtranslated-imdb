"Well, Chuck Jones died, allowing his characters to add his characters with cheap explosions, and an anime from the United States swallows his style and gives them super powers." "But sir ?, are not we all ready for the many offers in the business that really resemble this - much less do not give up the dreams of the original creators." "Yes, these offers make us a bunch of money, and we need more!" "But do not bother every man and woman who grew up in this period the least of the characters?" "Hello, you're right, set it up in the future, make it all characters from the original characters, and change all the names a bit ... but not much, we still need to be able to stimulate the success of the classics." <br /> <br /> Well, that's the only reason I think about why this is. If you look at the past of the terrible desecration of the beloved Lonnie Lunz, it looks like a good show. But there is already Teen Titan, which is the same bloody thing. All the characters wear clothes like Batman, they roam in a kind of ship that fights superheroes, they have super powers, the only difference is that they speak like chromatic tones and have similar names and attributes. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing falls into the category of "It's ridiculous that it's good". Think of Brother Super Mario, Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check it out. If you are from the younger generation (what this actually means), and the greedy CEOs can look very predictable, run with him and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this cartoon, we do not have a problem with you, it's the people who calculated this thing together, I'm crazy about it. You know how to say that piracy is like stealing a car; this exhibit is like stealing a grave. They may have also dug all the people involved in the original animation, removed it on the screen, put on their clothes, hacked the pirates, and deducted the money. If this show does not use characters (those that did not look like Looney Tunes in any way) that have made millions of studios already, that would be good. but not! For the Warner Brothers shame, for shame. <br /> <br /> If you see this thing as a 30-second quantity on a ring from the Simpsons or the Guy family, I love it. As I can not believe that this has been at all. I bet 80% of the people working at this show hate it. But regardless of its true importance, this exhibition will be forgotten in 10 years, while original copies will remain forever. Or at least until the world ends. <br /> <br /> "Coming 2008, Snoopy has returned the peanut ring, now they have deadly laser rays and can become invisible! Can Charlie Brown defeat the strange warlord Zabar?
