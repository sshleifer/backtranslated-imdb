In 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a galaxy, far or near. He was trying to complete a movie titled THX and so on. This date is a re-manufactured history of certain George. I'm sorry he has only gravity to defend it. This is just a promotion for the manager, representatives and others. Allah. It has little intrinsic technical value. It is a booklet. Lead play George is fine, as with Lia's character, the character of Darth ersatz. Everything else is plain slag. O wasteful. However, I have accomplished the task I think. The rest of the film is just a water tread to kill the time I think. Booklet only.
