If you are after the real story of the early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you pursue a repellent crusher placed reasonably with a technical theme, you have found that you are a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is an inaccurate portrayal of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, making me almost cry. (Write in Artemisia errors in Google and check out some reality vs. fiction articles.) From a purely artistic point of view, the film was fine: collections, costumes, and special chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive 17th century experience. Although the FACTUAL FACTUAL GLACTING errors listed above slightly disappoint them. <br /> <br /> I wonder how the director / co-writer Annies Merlet defended her film at the time? You may have refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which he would have regretted, because it allows you to confront him.
