You can not even say that this movie is bad because it's sad, it's just painful. Lacks any real intelligence or imagination, extends an extremely thin plot, and "jokes" (predictable and threaded) are woven into such an excessive length in which the boredom and the lethargy overcome the viewer quickly. There is another step to celebrate John Waters' sharp decline and remind us that what we "shocked" or ridiculed 30 years ago does not work the same way now. We have seen all this before, and no longer breaks any taboos because they have evaporated for a long time. Great Miss.
