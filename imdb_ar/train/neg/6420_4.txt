Well, I'll admit, I've started working pleasantly and well, but then just landed, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gillard may have finished reading the script after about 5 minutes of the movie and the only reason I was fully seated was the movie, Seeing the evolution of the ned, I am surprised, well, people I can not even tell you whether there is Vin, because the end leaves you puzzled, and then the role of credit, you like what the hell? This was not worth a play tour, I'm sorry, but that does not mean it was terrible, the only reason I gave it is 4 is that it had a few parts of thump ... that's it! You can watch it, and I'm not telling you not to do it, hey you might like it or even like it! But if you hate her, do not say I did not warn you!
