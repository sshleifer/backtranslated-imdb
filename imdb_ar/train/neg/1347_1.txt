Perhaps the inspector's favorite cartoon instrument was the 1980s. I enjoyed the first and second seasons of the series in addition to Christmas 1992 "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas". Some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but need to compare it with DiC's 2002 "Last Case's Last Case: Claw's Revenge" so they will find the second season to be an absolute gold. <br /> <br /> Being a gadget lover, I could not resist seeing the animated inspector tool in something that was not associated with Gadget Boy. I bought the film and swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I was not even ready for what I was about to see. <br /> <br /> There were hardly any objects from the original display still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some of the downsides of this movie: * Humor is not present in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Benny and Brin (originally having an almost equal part in the serial as a tool) are still missing from work for 15 years. To 20-minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * The original music for Saban & Levy does not exist, and the result is a sub-par. (I realize that Saban has its own production company now, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any of the gadget tools that made the show so enduring, gadget-brolla, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which has already been used but has not been named the same), as well as other tools for the hat and hand. In this film, the legs of his instruments were overlapping rather than springs. This kind of thing disturbs the real fans of the show, which is simply not necessary to change. <br /> <br /> * The original string gadget is now fast convertible, presumably convertible. All fans of the original series enjoyed turning the gadget into a toolkit and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimby has become too short to mean the tool. He was always angry at the original series, but that drives the situation a lot. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer notebook. <br /> <br /> Are there any pros to this movie? Well, here goes ... <br /> <br /> Maurice Lamarch does a good job of taking over the role of Don Adams as a great inspector. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby hints at a real villain from the animated series: Great Wambini (the classic "Gadget" of the second season, voiced by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for more recovery factors for this movie? Well, you're lucky. Life revolves around making choices and living out. Most situations in life have a purpose even if they are to teach the lesson. Lesson learned here: Maintain the original version! "If it is not broken, do not fix it." Fans must direct the real tool to this film; surely you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, DC is screaming! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1", which contains the first 22 episodes of the series. As a real fan of the gadget, the 80's and many other DiC enthusiasts, I urge you to buy "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas", which are excellent discs and will certainly bring back good memories.
