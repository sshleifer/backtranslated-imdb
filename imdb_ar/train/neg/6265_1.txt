I happened to be the nephew of the manager. It took me years to put my hands on a copy of this film, and I can confirm that it is already one of the worst films ever. My uncle does not have a copy of it anymore (I asked). I look forward to bringing a copy of it. <br /> <br /> The average movie rating is currently 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, I should put it somewhere in the mid-30s at IMDb "Bottom 100", but with just 206 votes, Put it down. <br /> <br /> In any case, I give copies of the film to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best / Worst Gift Ever?
