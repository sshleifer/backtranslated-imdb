This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and finally got a chance to see these gems that are hard to find. They even came with original play reviews of other Italian horror classics such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this film. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is inherently alien to Lucio Fulci's famous "ZOMBIE" which began in 1979. Similarly, compared to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a heinous conspiracy and a handful of very bad actors who They keep this trash "horror". There is almost no (unless one is afraid of people running around with green algae on their faces) and English dubbing is less embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This plot is somehow a secret military operation with a group of incompetent scientists (a stupid male and his stupid female head) who are developing some kind of chemical called "one death" that is supposed to restore Activation of the dead. Unless there is a need to check my ears, I do not remember a reason to search for "one death". It seems to exist only to harm the poor souls who made a mistake in choosing the "star" in this laughter film festival. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Death One" is tested on the body (of whom I swore like Jules Brenner), and after being injected into his system, sits upright and explodes his head! The sound effects are also very fun - as the bubbles of the face of the corpse are green, you can hear the sound of "breaking up the paper". The "first death" is moved outward and is "fixed" by a group of thieves where one collides, but it hits itself after cutting itself on an open flask. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, a man turns into a zombie, but not before he flees in time to a cheap hotel, strikes a humble porter and kills a maid by pushing her face into the bathroom mirror (!). The army arrests and takes action immediately before "judging" anyone who is unlucky enough to be inside the "pollution zone" and turns the hotel upside down. They find the injured thief and burn his body, but the smoke affects a herd of birds flying over the chimney stack (!). <br /> <br /> We have made an introduction from a group of men on leave from the army, listening to "awesome music" coming out of a crowded little box while leaving a broken load of naked girls leaning out of the windows and showing their breasts. Can someone say "zombie food"? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a stop-car to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that have been hit by "zombie" smoke! <br /> <br /> Birds attack their boyfriend and the girl goes to an abandoned gas station to look for water. This is one of the hilariously hilarious moments of the film. They are walking around this dirty old building and clearly rusted rust where they still ask out loud, "Hello, is there anyone here? Please, I need some water!" I encounter a group of zombies, one chained to the wall (!) And the other swinging a sickle. After a bit of waste and retreat on the ground, it evades, but not before the gas station blows up. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the birds attack a trailer load from the whale and click one girl and the injured. They all move to the same hotel where the original infection occurred, and this is where the happiest moment in the film takes place. After a few hours (at most), the motel itself became drowned in the dust, planted with chroma all the time, and seemed to have been abandoned for years. Anyway, what's the best place to go from this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to collapse as many people go out together to fall stuck in an incredibly stupid attitude about a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most exhilarating moment relates to a man and a woman exploring an abandoned village, in which the woman hangs, "This place is a dump!" Then proceed to get "pushed" from the balcony by zombie to the infested waters of Perina where her legs were bitten and turned into a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile, her friend who returned to the hotel after she got the effect of HOURS in early turn into a coma! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a lot of contradictions in this film which makes this movie very stupid for words. For example, the rate of time experienced by people with "ascites" varies greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds, sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies run, others pull their feet and walk very slowly. Some even make kung fu moves, while others hide under haystacks to surprise people. Some zombies even talk! The most horrific moments of course are the infamous "zombie head" in the "refrigerator" that "lifts" itself into the air and "attacks" a stupid man looking for food. It is interesting that his girlfriend gets upset by her throat through a "broken head" (LMAO!) Part. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was the lack of story lines that included people in the fact that zombies had killed them. We have never been able to see them return as zombies, in fact, the only ones who see "zombies" are the birds and the only girl who hits her legs. Other than that, I expected at least that the couple who were killed in the kitchen and / or the man who was killed on the bridge would return as zombie. It is also amazing that these zombies take "a few pieces" and then move on to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moments of course were the zombie fetus. An infected pregnant woman lying on a hospital bed. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" is trying to give birth to the child (!) And her face is shivering with a coma, before pushing her head to the woman's stomach where her hand bursts and begins to crept. Rest her face off. Eternal! <br /> <br /> As usual, all characters are ideal templates for this type. The huge military officer, the useless woman who is trying to scream for murder, the obvious characters being killed (watching the man chasing the chickens!) I think this is really a comedy. There were many laughable scenes, such as a grenade launcher (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climate scene where the man screams, "I'm thirty ... thirty for you blood!" Fashion is very bad - the same zombie reappears throughout the film, wearing the same "Asian" clothes that can be found in Bruce Lee's film, and watch out for the 60th blue skirt showing the girl in the hotel. She is wearing when she and her friend collide with the injured man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open as usual to the horrific story line. It turns out that the DJ radio narrates throughout the entire movie is a zombie itself and warns its listeners from "the beginning of the end" while the survivors take off in a helicopter. Barely the "dawn of dawn" if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this film offers a lot of laughter. Minimal, and what is there, is very convincing, not to mention fantasy. The usual mixture of black blood and thick green goo is shaken from crying sores and "coma makeup" consists of green moss. ZOMBI 3 offers a good rental service for a night or night party of beer and popcorn. Other than that, horror lovers must stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
