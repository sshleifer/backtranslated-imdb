To be honest, I heard that this was a very bad thing before I saw it, but I never allow others to influence my views. In fact, I'm likely to see something challenging! Bullwhip had one thing happening to me before watching anyway, the fact that Ronda Fleming and those wonderful eyes were immediately interesting. The picture is not very good, it is actually morally questionable, all characters are rotten and dim in form or form in one way, all driven by greedy or selfish victories, all good and good if the ocean movie manages to do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a tight picture Shivering. Unfortunately, you can not, and because the end fills your eyes with sugar, you can not help yelling that you have been deceived to watch a very bad movie, no one in the team gets out of any balance, with the main guy Jay Madison painfully wooden in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Even the beautiful Ronda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
