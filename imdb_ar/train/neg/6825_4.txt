Once the star of the great excitement that has fallen on the face of the earth ends in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reunion with some former co-stars to clean the city. <br /> <br /> A low key, often to the brink of brilliance, does not often act as a "motion comedy". Part of the problem is casting Chris Klein as a former movement hero. It's not bad, but it's really incredible to be someone who is considered a strong man. As I said it is not bad, it is just a mistake in determining the cause of his background story. The real problem here lies in the combination of the script, which is really funny and sometimes artificial, and the direction that the infantry is to the harbor of malice. There is no life in the way things are prepared. It's as if the director had a list of shots and went on that list. It makes for an unattractive film. However, the film spreads from time to time to life, as in the final show which ends the film. This sequence succeeds, but since the earlier parts of the film have stumbled because of its depletion of much of its power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. It's worth it if you're a fan of actors or a great admirer of independent cinema in all its forms, but that's just a disappointment.
