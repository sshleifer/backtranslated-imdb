Play Becky Harris The role of a female shopper who is sad to be in the store at the wrong time, obviously the sole purpose of your presence in this movie is to provide a reason to wear remote controls! Miss Harris looks to me in her fifties or older when she comes to the place for the first time. Once you have bullying red hair with it, it becomes clear that this is not AARP queen. If these are not some of the coolest assets that have been shown on celluloid, I want someone to recognize me. She was amazingly captured in my opinion, and I wore a VHS copy to capture her charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not really worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something convincing and somewhat intelligent, yet I was disappointed by either. God bless you Becky Harris!
