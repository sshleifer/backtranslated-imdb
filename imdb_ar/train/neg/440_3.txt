There are no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three main areas. 1) The embarrassing humor based solely on the characters fool themselves. 2) grief and 3) anxiety. This step focuses on the last step, forgetting the first point almost with the continuation of the film. No loss though, because the humor that there is no funny. I think the cast's performance is good, despite his loss behind all this pain and is soon forgotten. I hoped there would be new ideas and influences, but there was nothing. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend time watching this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
