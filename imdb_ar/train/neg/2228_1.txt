The film is weak, says the cover of the box that the gang of East Los Angeles is the most difficult gangs and it really Santa Ana, and that James Cahill acting like a queen of the closet brings down all the powerful men in the gang Chloe difficult. I tried to restore my money from the video store this movie was very bad and boring and meaningless and beat it up. He was also on the abnormal sexual end away from what the video box advertises. James Cahill must act in the film "Gay Pornography". James in every scene, can not save his life. The movie features Eva Longoria hot, but James can not even score with her !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt that I was watching gay porn and was turned off by the entire movie. James obviously wants to be with the men, but he gives in to his anomalous wishes, and he knocks the gang members over and over again. His martial arts skills are very slim at best, some real gang members will take him and his weak skills and shred him with new ones.
