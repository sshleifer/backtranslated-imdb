The only reason I remember this film is that it is (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We withdrew and felt insulted, and we wanted to recover our money, but we could not get back the time. <br /> <br /> It was the amendment that took the life of this film. When the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles equipped with rocket launchers, the film completely offends the public's intelligence by these rogue villains in the launch of the Volkswagen 4x4 Bugs firing rockets on the truck. Please, rockets on a truck known to carry plutonium? What's worse than this VW managed to get 15-18 shots of the 4 rocket launcher. You'll see on the Volkswagen with 4 missiles firing 2 of them, the truck is cut off with another one attached, and back again with two later attached rockets, Another, then moved in front of the truck and now returned to the entire range of 4 missiles. <br /> <br /> We have made it difficult in the hope of a great end that never happened. They seem to have run out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just a ridiculous thing.
