I probably watch 200 films a year, both in theaters and at home, and I can confidently say that this is the worst film I've ever seen this year (if not ever, I've never actually seen "Quest of the Delta Knights"). This movie is just a bad joke after a bad joke addressed to the age of 13 years and because I was resentful to see it on a bus trip I could not get out of it. <br /> <br /> You prefer yourself and skip this one in the driveway. The four dollars could be spent better on any film with numbers produced by Jerry Brookheimer.
