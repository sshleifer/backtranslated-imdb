Do you want to know the secret of making a slanted film in a fitness center? Just show the movie with beautiful ladies in very tight exercise clothes and make them bend and grind the ground as if they were in a polite club. This is what the makers of this horrible, terrible film did. This little trick made me watch until the bitter end. This is the worst film I have ever seen, but each time I was ready to switch the channel, they would add another scene with girls and I would stay. As a sponsor, the Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a show for the beautiful girls who work, it's a success. A strong recommendation to avoid unless you thought half the movie is a great T & A show that appeals to you.
