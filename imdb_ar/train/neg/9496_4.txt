Clint Eastwood's romantic drama revolves around the loving relationship between a beautiful hippie (Kai Linz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly reliable in this very interesting arrangement). The text is simple but not without some studied sections; however, the script is clich√© in middle age so far that most of the picture comes in childish form. It's probably a lot better with different threads: Holden and Lennes do not meet well (they're too weak and seem to be flying over), making their intimate scenes less exciting than uncomfortable. Dated, hazy romantic, most memorable. ** from ****
