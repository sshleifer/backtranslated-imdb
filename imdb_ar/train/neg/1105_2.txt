Oh my. How can they make films of this beauty, but that's very bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll doesnt make crap like this. There is not even a hint for a decent story or multi-layered or attractive characters. It's just a random series of senseless chatter that joined together to make a "film". I assume that children up to the age of 3 are the only ones who can enjoy them, because the world is not completely dimensioned and the story is incoherent, so that anyone greater than it can harass it. But again, it is very scary for anyone under the age of 6 years, most likely that no one should ever watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little girl can make a better story, and although she may not be able to draw pictures beautifully, her stories are worth listening to. Please, on behalf of those who believe, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I will give it 2 out of 10, and this is for graphics exclusively, because the development of the story and characters is so bad that they deserve a negative evaluation. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch it anyway ... remember I warned you.
