The satire of Monobi Mitchell in Chopis has some laughter and some deliberate violence. I will not say soaked in blood. But there is an insult and injury. Max Mathieu (John Cassini) is a representative of characters who has a strong adaptable presence on the screen, but has a track record in his selection of the parts he follows. There is always a nephew of a producer or seemingly trivial reason for not giving him the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such ideas. A rewarding career is just a swing, push and shoot away. Other cast members: Ren√© Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Belles, Frank Cassini, and a veil by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, this is a business show ... or is it?
