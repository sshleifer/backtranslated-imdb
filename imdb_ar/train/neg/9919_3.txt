In the opening scene of "The Story of Malta", Guinness is amazingly similar to Noel Coward, where I fully expected his first words to be "some women need to hit regularly - like the cogs" or some of the weary boredom makers of the world. His dialogue is hardly a prose, and even Mr. Cain would have a problem bringing him to life. In fact, Mr. Guinness wanders in the picture as if looking for a focal point and fails to find one. And here lies the deadly weakness in the entire film. Mr. J. Hawkins is up early and ends up performing "Jack Hawkins" without an ounce of individuality. He could have been filmed from any of more than a dozen British war films. Their schtick for very little purpose. Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta in the same way that it failed to put London on its knees. The courage of the Maltese people was recognized in the face of the continued threat from the king and the island was given the cross of George Crosse. The theme is worth thinking about in a film, but the "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most caring sense. It gives the impression that it is cobbled together to meet a deadline, perhaps before the actors lose the will to live.
