This must be really worth the "O" rating, or even ten negative. I have watched this show throughout the ages and the show has jumped on the shark around the 7th series. However, this episode is proof that the show jumped off the shark. The writing is lazy, silly, tolerant to herself, and not even worth the trash like Peaves and Boothide. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be silly and still fun - the Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy of Monte Cristo - all the "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is something as ridiculous as in "This is the worst thing I've ever seen". Indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate that I have ever seen. It's absolutely horrible, and this comes from a person with a Stargate in her cage. <br /> <br /> It makes me want to sell all my Stargate stakes more seriously.
