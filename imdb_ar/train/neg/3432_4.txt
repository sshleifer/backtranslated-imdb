Killer and rapist cannibal killed by a crazy cop in the place of his last murder. In his grave, he met worship with plans to revive him by urinating on the tomb. This works of course as he wakes up ripping the men's penis and returns to the old killing ways with a new zombie look. Two policemen who are a bit mad about the city's scum and have a drug problem have returned to the case. Two members of the original community also try to stop the murderer by reviving another kind of dead. Thinking that they had made their departure but outside the tomb comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. It looks a bit confusing indeed but not just in the trash. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible and one of the policemen is the same man who plays Dr. Vincent Van Gore in the faces of the Gore series and is just as bad as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just struggles to get his terrible lines out. I am now with low budget cinema but this movie is very bad. If it was not so easy on the ladies' eyes and also his nudity, I would have fallen asleep. There are a few gaps, but nothing more than some animal courage on the victims' stomach. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his long penis that he uses to rape his victims is kind of funny at times. There is also a decent half scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The squirrel doll is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic game on the fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad. You expect the killer to fight more than he does. God knows how they raised enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
