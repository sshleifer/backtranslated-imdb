This film was announced on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every version. So when we went to Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But boy, how sad this film is! It's a Hollywood movie about a movie in a movie. The shadows clearly show that we are not ready to produce "big Hollywood movies." I'm not a film critic, but I think the good film starts with a good text. The text is a nightmare. As my subject line says, nothing, and then shaves. You can stare at the TV too, without really seeing anything. This was our feeling when we saw shadows. Shades is a bad production!
