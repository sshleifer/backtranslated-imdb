I suppose any novel that has largely fallen like Moby Dick will not find much interest with the Depression era fans who have enough of their own problems. But any similarity in Herman Melville's classic novel is just a coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is an introduction to the main story as we know it, not many of which were saved for the film. We meet first with Ehab Kareli (who has his last name and his brother) as one of the happy spirits with two feet and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, daughter of Father Maple. Drake, who plays Lloyd Hughes, wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in superior performance. Barrymore did not master the soundtrack entirely, and he gave all his history of silent history as well as a theatrical sound that would shake the rafters of any movie theater in which this film was played. <br /> <br /> Leg to the big whale Moby Dick and I must say that the amputation scene was very outrageous. Of course this was all before the blog. I am still sure that the 1930 audience trembled. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of a search for a lizard was thought to have made him loathsome in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly motivated by Melville, in fact there are no female characters in Moby Dick as he has written. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was to invest the crew of Ihab Pequod with characters. Unlike Queequeg bayonet bayonet names exist, but not characters. Starbuck and Stubbs may be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I was seeing this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
