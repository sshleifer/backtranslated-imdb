This film is a good example of the extreme shortage of writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people have paid for this unwanted piece shows that there is a lack of original talent and ideas in the entertainment field. The idea that the masses paid for watching this movie (and like an idiot hired a movie) is also discouraging. <br /> <br /> The madman (3 years ago) kills the teenager's family because he wants them. For no reason kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see bad representation and direction. Years later, the obsessed teacher escapes from prison. They - the usual bad writing - no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. The obsessed teacher becomes somehow a seal of the Navy and can sneak around it and sniff the people and the knife is the supernatural killer. Certainly !!! Now the obsessed teacher kills the hotel maid for no reason, and the bell rings for amusement, and begins to search for teenage friends. Now there is a perfect way to make the girl love you. A frantic teacher sneaks out of the hotel - again it's stupid, the policeman knew his face - but he walks beside him. Now two policemen are killed outside the teenager's house and somehow sneak into her bedroom and kill her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not one positive thing about this piece of trash. If you put any other profession under this low quality, they will be separated. However, these idiots earn hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this garbage.
