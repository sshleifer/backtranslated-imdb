This week, I thought it would be good to catch up with Kory Haim, watching two "Lost Boys" last week. It does not mean that I am a fan - not quite - but I liked these two basics in some movies in my first teen days. <br /> <br /> So, I prepared myself for three of his starring films. Unfortunately, I chose the Dream Machine as the first (I had not seen it before), and it was very terrible. I decided to lock Curie back in my wardrobe and let him restrain me first, before I go back to something else. But I managed to fight my way through this film first. I had the impression that he wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Beller" (1986), but fell into her own delusions. In practice, the entire film wants to be a comedy, and eventually tries to be a desperate film. The only good thing about the "dream machine" is the premise: dead body in a Porsche car box. All the rest failed very badly, it is embarrassing. Even more Haim. I can dig him up as a young enthusiast, but at least when he comes with some form of guidance. Obviously this was not the case in the "Machine of Dreams". So, we have a perfect car, yes, black Porsche. Haim is a perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick barely has any lines in the film. Perfect murder ... almost? Some dude who falls on his ass as the villain of the film, trying to film the entire body to steal back from the trunk, did not really succeed, and then at the end of the film he thought Michael Myers (minus White William Shatner mask and Corrie Haim's mistakes for Jamie Lee Curtis. They may have made this flick any lame if they tried a stupid movie that is not funny with a story that leads to any director who does not know how to run his team ... A final question for Mr. Haim: Who was the idea that You smile directly at the camera in the last shot of the film? You or the director?
