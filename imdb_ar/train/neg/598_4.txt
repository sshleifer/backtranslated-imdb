Please, be careful: this movie, although it's a very bad story, was one of the ugliest movies I have ever seen ... never. Just remember that before you settle down on the couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So, officially begins with a ceremony. Just your average party but there is someone out there. It's beautiful in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Save face. Will help you later. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, Kate went to find George Clooney (less pain that the chart was bad?) and thus takes the tube. This is London underground in the middle of the night, but stupid like that. So say the following schedule, and last, the train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, a stupid party girl that is, decides she can take a nap in an additional 7 minutes. They usually miss the train and find themselves closed in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie starts from there. Blood, guts, limbs, and even some parts of the body that I will not remember are cut, crushed and eventually dislodged from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a typical horror; a pretty girl but thick in women of the type of distress and psychotic and strange patients. Or, as it may be, Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say they offer if you are in Saw or Hostel or in Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of the US, Scream with pleasing horror needs a lot thanks.
