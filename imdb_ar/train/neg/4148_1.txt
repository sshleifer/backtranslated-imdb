I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting. <br /> <br /> The movie began and a world of pain and visual torture was quickly invaded. <br /> <br /> I finally know what hell looks like. It is this film. forever. This film has no value. It was not really a plot. There were things happening in every scene, but there was no comprehensive explanation of why anything happened. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest that you line up with the nearest blender with the oil and try and put as many bullets as possible. Can. You'll find that the result will be more fun than this movie. <br /> <br /> You do not even see it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, it means they win.
