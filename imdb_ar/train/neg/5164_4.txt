The main plot in this film is not bad. A lady makes her big and goes back to her mother to be enthroned. But in spite of the good acting by Robert Young and Ive Arden, the film is in chaos. This was blamed on Jean Crawford or the director or both, as her performance was so bad. Instead of being a real person, she impersonates a wonderful figure of deer caught in the headlights. In other words, you stare into space and have the expression "golly I am SOOOO awesomeness". After a few minutes, it became really annoying to me. Now, this certainly is not the only Crawford movie I do not like for its performance, where it has done more than its share of exaggeration in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of its subsequent films, such as BERSERK! My advice is the experience of a different Crawford film - definitely there was better.
