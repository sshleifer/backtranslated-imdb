1993 was the year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won the Oscar. Who knew I would be extra in a movie with him? I was actually driven by an additional "My Boyfriend's Back", filmed in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, Texas. The original title was Johnny Zombie (thank God the producers had a change of heart!) I was in theater theater. I rushed to watch the movie the day it was shown in the theaters. It's more a comedy than a horror film. But ... for a good laugh, you may want to check it out. Nothing is close to the quality of "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Dead Shawn", but the cheese factor is good enough. Zhao
