This movie contains a stinky TV spread everywhere. However, it has started with fantastic intentions, featuring exquisite collections of props, props and original costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a terrible cheesy nose dialogue, and television dramatized melodramatic television. The characters were so happy that I sometimes thought they were about to turn into an opaque pool of goo, and the work was so twisted and so badly cut that it looked as if the soldiers were standing around and taking turns shooting at each other. The Germans were so unrealistic that it was painful to see him. The only thing German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans were. Please take my words for this purpose. I am a big fan of the type of war, and this film is nonsense. However, this DVD has an excellent additional feature, covering letters from the front lines of World War I, making this lease not a complete waste of my time.
