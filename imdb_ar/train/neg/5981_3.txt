I have only seen this film (mainly because Brady Corbett is in it) and I must say I was not pleased. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the storyline needed little follow-up. Also, I think this film would have achieved much better results through more insults and blood, and also if PG-13 was rated. <br /> <br /> This will certainly attract more people to see it -> Teens. What might also attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls), would be a great close-up of Corby Brady on the Thunderbird sticker! <br /> <br /> Although the movie has low points, I still see it and I think it was fine!
