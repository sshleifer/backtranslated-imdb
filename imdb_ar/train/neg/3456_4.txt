Everyone in this movie tells Ravi Carothers how talented she is, what a great director she will one day be, and so forth. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "Next Jane Campion," they call it. Even apart from the fact that they are overly classified, they share a lot. Both are direct films. They are ladies. They are both Australians. (Well, give or take out.) <br /> <br /> Yes, it is one of those films where she is a wonderful character, and we have to swallow it and accept it. But I'll tell this to Carothers: It's nice. And wonderful. Later. Here are some ideas about her lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of the director's talent is to deal with people. Why are Carothers so bad in making her crew notice them? So that it is easier for everyone to walk around the group and kill, I expect. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most unconvincing images of a series of movies you've ever seen? After all, you must have been filmed on a real movie set. How can they make mistakes? If the Rendall group represents half of the shame of the lack of staff, it is no wonder that he has completed his film at all. <br /> <br /> (3) Caruthers - the fictional director - created a brand new 1980s horror flick. Fat Opportunity. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - the actual and most talented director - set himself the same task, realizing that he could not be done, and settled (sigh) to learn a parody instead. Of course, not enough parody work. Once surrounded by the cast and crew at the isolated mansion, the film spends most of its time doing what happened badly in the horror films of the 1980s ... well, and worse. <br /> <br /> (4) So far, however ... the film begins without parody but with good frankness of horror in the eighties, and starring (this is so unbelievably good) Molly Ringwald. This cramping is much better than anything followed. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you could see the movie in the movie, instead of the movie.) However, it was also filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it is still possible to raise the horror of the 1980s. You just have to give up knowing the sarcastic things you care about. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what the horror of teenagers would be in the 1980s if all the characters had Australian accents, but I know now. Strangely, I'm glad I know. Need I did not know I had achieved.
