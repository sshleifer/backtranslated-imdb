During the first two seasons, I thought the Apprentice was a very exciting and attractive show. The combination of Reality TV and an innovative 16-week work interview enabled program producers to maintain the importance of the show and not "there." <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and has nothing to do with the business - at all. In previous seasons, they used to focus heavily on business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the meeting room where contestants are expected to do everything to keep them in the fair (that is lying, talk about waste, backstabbing, etc.). The meeting room can be fun to watch, but entertains in its low time - sometimes you wonder if you're watching the old Jerry Springer ring again. Tasks at the show, at most, boring, are often an offer for companies stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. What is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in the sixth season? This is just stupid and has nothing to do with working in real life. <br /> <br /> I do not respect any of the contestants this season, it seems they are all stupid to me. In the previous seasons, at least some of the contestants were honest, and now the contestants seem to be killing their mother to keep them in the show. It also seems that the huge ego of Donald Trump becomes bigger and bigger every season he goes through. Frankly, I can not see why anyone with common sense wants to work for it. His mentality in the meeting room is mostly meaningless at all, and at times he seems to like to chase people for what he deserves. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The apprentice. Please NBC, for God's sake, get the supply of air as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to watch. The apprentice was previously a great TV show, but now it's just a big joke.
