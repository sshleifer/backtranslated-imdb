What stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time evaluating any points of this offer. Not worth the time. The only comment I will make is - why make such DUMB, doofus inarticulate to be a star? FOX said it would not return John Doe, but would return the death engine group, such as Joe Millionaire, to another round of brain cell death for the American public. I lost it, IMHO.
