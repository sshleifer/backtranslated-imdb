The land is destined to be no more thanks to Father Bergado and a handful of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was tricked into appearing by producers who told him that there are many great actors involved) is Father Bergado and gets his usual serious and frightening routine. The cast is not too bad, although most of them are now retired from acting. The movie has awesome sound effects (created primarily by pressing the keys on an apparently old computer), and he sometimes thinks ironically - showing a scene from the sky, for example, for what looks like hours in every-time. Despite this, the story is somewhat funny in a world of some kind doomed, and the production is appropriate. One interesting scene includes Albert Band and his wife Jackie. The Meda band is written by Frank Ray Pirelli and Charles Band-Benah-Burton assistant. Despite its stunning nature, I really wanted to see how everything was resolved and so I completely liked it.
