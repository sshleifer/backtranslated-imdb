I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley, Piersy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Awesome! That would be great!" I was very wrong. The story was all screwed up. In fact I still do not understand it. It just seems to me that all the characters did not drink, smoke (opium?) And have sex. Those qualities are not good movie, but please! Where was the story? I made myself the most complete film, and yes, it ended to the end, but by that time the film was almost finished. Hire them if you really want. Just do not trust the back of the box.
