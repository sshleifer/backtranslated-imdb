This "movie" is similar to a music video. In an interview in 2004, Kostorica said that when he makes films, he feels like making music, and when he makes music, he feels like making films. The best thing to "promise me this" is the music written by Storipur Kosturica. <br /> <br /> In the same interview, Kostorica said that the dialogues in the films were like noise. "Give me this" with a little "hype". <br /> <br /> Like "Life is a miracle." He also looked like a music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but he had a beautiful plot. "This promise me" has no conspiracy. I was waiting for this film with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozik - one of my favorite script writers, who also participated in "Miracle Life". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise", and much to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, recognizable as written by Ranko Bozic. The director used the other part of the script to make an anarchist music video of his son Stribor's music. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the texts "Gypsy Time" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kostorica does not follow the text. The Black Cat was the only scenario that Kostorica said he would not touch. According to Jordan Mihić, after all, Kostorica returns to the text, and if he does not, he does not make a good film. I think this is the case with "promise me this." It should have followed the scenario of Ranko Bozik. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is described as "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. Comic moments are the same as "Black Cat Black Cat", but they are not funny at all. I think the difference comes from the fact that "The White Cat is the Black Cat" written by Jordan Mihić. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people who liked "promise me this", they found it a very positive film.
