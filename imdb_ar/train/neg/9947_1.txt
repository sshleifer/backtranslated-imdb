This movie was terrible. I swear they did not write a text until they managed to get the whole movie out. Ice T was annoying as hell. * Phth spoilers are like reasons not to see it * They sit and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. He had been gone for a long time. The ground was very difficult and it was impossible to track them with the dogs coming out. When the ICE-T is on that hill and the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN is used as a sniper rifle (and then cuts a tree with eight shells it will take 1000 shells to cut a tree of this size.) Handguns are inaccurate at 100 yards. They even saw a reflection. What reflects light? I have not seen room in this thing. Also when he was shot in the gut and continued to walk, it was delayed until death there. In addition, it ends where a rock or cigarette is stuffed into men's comrades. It will not explode and kill him. The bullet still shoots on the T ice but the barrel mess.
