I could not believe my eyes once I saw this movie. There is no point in either blood and violence. Unlike other scary films that had a big impact on the film, this film is just blood, gore, killed one by one. This film is not fun at all, and does not contain any plot or line of a meaningful story, nor does it have intelligence. Blood seems very fake and this film in general makes no sense. Do not waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of reckless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary but just disgusting. This was probably the worst horror film I have ever seen of all the horror films I've ever seen.
