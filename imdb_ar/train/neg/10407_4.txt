I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins, boring and boring. All the scenes of the movement were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" is reduced to the size of a modern house cat, if not smaller. This film was just an unnecessary film in the epic Tremor, because although it tells the story of how the gerboid is formed, the story is stupid and futile. Well, if you want to tell a story, let's go back in time. SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) is used as a person in the past when he is a person present in other Tremor movies. Geez ... If you have not watched this movie, do not waste your time. To Tremors, 1, 2, 3, for a good time. However, make sure that the remote control sits right next to you with the STOP button that works quickly to undo this nonsense.
