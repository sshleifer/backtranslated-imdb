So, when Herbie reappeared for the first time, I was very happy to see Dean Jones. I just wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat popcorn with excessive butter. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of an interesting / interesting story whenever I see a film, if I do not take some kind of medication. This is another good film for therapy. There are no big laughs, no complicated plot lines, no difficult transformations. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the full download. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw La Lohan on the screen since I shared places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent at that), and I can not say I was very impressed this time. Irrespective of the color of her hair, which is constantly changing and unnaturally unnatural, she did not ring as if the next child who had spent his life was wandering in the racetrack. Her "need for speed" was not consistently portrayed in the film - perhaps somewhere else - she seemed older than her role, and apparently she was always looking for something (a concert? The designer directs a new place to spend money?) Sat down. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; it seemed that romance was mandatory at best. The only time Lyndsay was engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was on top appropriately like the Eiffel Bad Guy Try Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herby again, and she liked the intro of the film with the stuff from old movies. If Disney appears with some Car 53 jewelry, I just wear some clothes to be loyal. His new feature (?) Was a bit inconsistent (does he draw his driver's ideas? Is he now a skateboard?) But whatever. We all knew how it would end, but I hope he ended up with someone just below Maggie. My head still hurts me from this Maggie lesson and we viewers got home. <br /> <br /> What would have made the film worthwhile? Make Herbie old in a real story with a real plot - at least, Herbie is as good as Lassie - but obviously this asks a lot. Why does Disney always go back to the same "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "The Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's a great movie for kids and those who do not have expectations. For the rest of us ... it's when you have the flu and you can not afford to hang the rear window.
