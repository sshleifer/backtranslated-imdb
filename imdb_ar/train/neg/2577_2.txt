This story had a different angle that aroused my interest, enough to buy an unprecedented VHS scene. This was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very beautiful story - about the paralyzed people in the hospital and their various personalities - it quickly turned into a soap opera that was very desecrated with unpopular characters. <br /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe), a white racial racist, who says the word "f" in every other sentence is so mean that they did not give him a first name in the film. It's a lot of fun to be around. Then, there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-talking women's minister. Snipes should have loved those arrogant "hip" speech-quick roles because he played in a number of them, such as "white men can not jump". Then there's the cute Helen Hunt, who plays "Anna", that lovely, personal character who has an affair with the leading character in Joel Garcia (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, this is an intimate, feeling kind of good stuff. It makes my heart melt by watching these nice people. But if you're a person who likes flamboyant characters portrayed by people who are flabbergasted in this hilarious movie, you might like this fact! Add Hollywood's correct political dose and there you go! What more can anyone want?
