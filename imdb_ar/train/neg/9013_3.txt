It is hard to praise this film very much. CGI has been a good dragon, but lacks proper modeling of light and shadow. Also, the same endless shots of the dragon stole through the passages that have become a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in acting credits, and I wonder what the former emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film! Such as "Whoopie Goldberg", must be an alias, and can be blamed for using it if it appears in this stink. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the representation is flat, the direction boring. If you have to watch this movie, go to your friend's house and immerse yourself in doing so - it will be fun.
