I liked the silent movies, but this was a bit too much. As much as I wish to say that it is worth the hour I stood in and I can not. I do not think any version of the movie is even close to the book. Do not try this on children, it may frighten them. The lady who played Poliana, how old was she? 38? I know that the labor laws were different then ... but come to people.
