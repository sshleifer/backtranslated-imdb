I like the horror movies that bring out a real amount of mystery like "Silent Hill" (which I found very good, but still, was missing) and movies that keep you guessing, I think this was one of those movies. At first, the film starts with some really good suspense and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then it rolls down the hill and from there it runs faster and faster. I mentioned the silent hill at first for a reason because I can see a lot of "stolen" subjects from this film here .. Overall I would say, watch the silent hill instead, it's better and more scary, it has a lot of suspense and the end is much better .. Best of all, you will not feel as disturbed as I did with this .. It seems that this is one of those "I love this movie, so I'm gonna remake it in my really bad version" kinda movie .. Oh and nothing else ... Lordi .. In the horror film ... This is like trying to scare a child carrying a care bear "He hugged me and will love you forever" written on his stomach ..
