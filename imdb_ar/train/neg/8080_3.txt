I had high hopes in this film, because it contains Charleston, Houston and Jack Palance. But those hopes crashed on the ground in the first 20 minutes or so. The Balance was ridiculous. This movie can not save even the beauty of the Houston or beauty of Anabel Schofield (or short naked scenes). Some of the effects of space were very good, but others were cheese. The plot was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans must skip this one. Grade A
