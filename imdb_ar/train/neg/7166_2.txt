This movie could have been very good, but it is still long. Cheesy special effects and so on. I could have looked at the past that if the story was not too bad. If there is more background story, it would be better. The plot revolves around the evil witch of Darwid associated with this migraine sufferer. The film continues continuously and does not explain anything at all, but continues to play it. Christopher Walker has a role, but it is completely meaningless, like most of the film. This film has potential, but it seems really bad for TV movies. I would avoid this film.
