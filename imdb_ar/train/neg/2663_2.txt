In an interview, David Duchovny said he was not able to watch until the first hour of the film - and you should not. The scene in which the owner of the house in which he committed a murder is asked if he can look around him - other than the name he launched and he could raise his performance for any episode of X files. It's on autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt flops horribly.
