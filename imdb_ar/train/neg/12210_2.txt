This movie is a joke and it must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever made. This is a typical film in the 1980s where you have one man who destroys the entire army himself. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very much like the commando of Schwarzenegger, but there you have Arnold kills the terrorist while here you have a certain nation that appears as bad guys. This film is anti-Soviet American propaganda. It is true that this was the height of the Cold War, but I am tired of the Communists or the Nazis always appearing as an enemy. There are a lot of American films that share this one thing. Why is there no film that shows Americans as an enemy? Who will believe that one soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think that such a thing would have happened? From his looks, he will certainly be seen by an average American exhibitor brainwashed.
