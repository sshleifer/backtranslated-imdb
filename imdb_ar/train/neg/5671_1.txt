If you want to see the animals exposed to the skin alive, and broke their heads, and the dogs were crashing, men shouting at them, this is one for you! But if you are fairly normal and do not need to see real shots of cruelty on animals, pass them. This film tries to shock the viewer, and it certainly does. And with animal snuff at first, the children were killed in the film (at least fake) was enough to turn it off. I have seen films like this before the footage of the abattoir (BTK) appears and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror film. We see horror and horror because we only know its own intrigue and effects, so we should not sit watching a film and watch the real killing of animals, not what the film rented. If there is anything, there should be a big warning sticker placed on these types of trash films so people will not be surprised. As a very fearful fan of terror, this one turned my stomach. The entire film crew and crew need to check their heads.
