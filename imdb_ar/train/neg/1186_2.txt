It is clear that Alrian Borukzyk did not house (1975) received in different ways: some are appalling, others are lamented for their courage. However, I did not get bored and bored, and I can not stop asking myself why the presentation of inconsistent and inconsistent images mysteriously revolves around a central subject, an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was actually going on about this film? Increased sexual activity in women? I've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a girl's growing sexual life without at least trying to describe him as a person not only as a narrative tool for a dream (in naked) monsters. Where there are no characters, there is no study of the characters. The woman who was persecuted by the beast was not a teenager, the girl who has sex with the black butler (also considered a beast?) Has a very big attitude towards sexual activity, where is consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes, we will need a little more objective material than a priest without a job, personality and attraction, but with a strong desire for young boys. <br /> <br /> Is it Bahimiyah? The metaphorical sense of the film prohibits any realistic examination of the Bahamian, especially since realistic examination requires realistic characters. So there is no real behemoth here. Some mythical monsters and priests speak with each other about the sin of the beast. Enough for the college essay on the subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I do not know, I do not know. I just know that a shotgun shot does not make a movie a war movie. Working with a topic should mean more than displaying its links to the topic. <br /> <br /> So, you can see the controversy. Do not be afraid of ignorance, nudity, libel, masturbation, and things. I'm not. Look at her as you look at any other story and you may discover that this is a bad-made story, badly edited, badly behaved, poorly written (really, some very nice pictures, the main character is a really beautiful-looking girl) Around the bush in a slow slumbering way will make the story smart. No. Makes them boring.
