The plot, personal development, and the gags in this film are all very weak. Completely waste of time. The end of "saving grace" is supposed to feel as warm and ambiguous as if the characters grew during their struggles. There was no such development to make such warm feelings as mysterious as possible. Drug gags are vulgar and much of the film does not ring the truth. This plot builds what is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then rushes through solving all pending problems in about a minute of screen time, leaving the viewer feeling like he has wasted his time.
