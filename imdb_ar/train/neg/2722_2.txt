For the big thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is an insanely insidious film from France and gives so-called "artistic films" a bad name. The story revolves around a bitter old story, Louis Trepor (Michelle Sobor), who is researching Tahiti for a heart transplant, but then I have no idea who was in the film or why they were doing what they were doing. With no coherent story to boast of, we lose the film early, although I am quite willing to admit that there may be someone already getting some deep messages from this film. <br /> <br /> This chaotic, slow drama lasts for two hours and five minutes - although I seriously suspect that anyone with any kind of life will remain suspended because of the final appropriations.
