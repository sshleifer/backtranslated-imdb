I did not like this film for many reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I was very disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this film saved itself, at least for me, it would have to pull itself out of the huge hole it had dug. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The film's draw for me was to see Gene Fonda and Felicity Hoffman. I do not know enough about Lindsay Lohan's work to see what she will attend to the film. After that, I was disappointed and all of them despite having "moments" in each of their shows. I imagine that finding "moments" for each of them was a very difficult task given the staggering lack of personal development and uninspiring dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film in general is badly written, directed and edited so that anyone suffers as an actor and hits him. I think that the non-respectful way in which I dealt with sexual abuse and the degrading and humiliating view of small American towns are the main reasons why this film failed to achieve this goal. As one reviewer noted and agreed, it is almost impossible to market the film because of its final form. I think that, or at least I hope there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting room (for the actor anyway) is sad for us, but if that's true, actors can feel solace in it and feel good about lending their talents Time for such flipping. Oh yes and something else ... I only once wished I could see an American movie that included sad settings that unfortunately disappeared, like those in this film, where the main characters did not inadvertently disappear and / or the Qatari side was not scattered with Pop cans, crashing CDs and other garbage!
