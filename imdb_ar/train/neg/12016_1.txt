If Bob Ludlum wanted to see this small series, to weep. This was a waste of time and money. I have read the book, and although the movies are not exactly what the book can be, CBS has wasted a lot of time and money in this, and it is embarrassing to claim that this was the work of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> The creator of the originator may have verified Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and watched the quality of the television series. <br /> <br /> Poor Meera, Blair, Angelica and Colm, why have they fallen so bent? <br /> <br /> Terrible !!
