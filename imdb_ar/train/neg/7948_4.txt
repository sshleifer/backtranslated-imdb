"The Seventh Mark" borrowed a lot of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Omen" (it really mixes the two stories). Even its title recalls BurJuman's "Seventh Seal". <br /> <br /> However, it starts well enough, with all the scattered seeds on the whole earth, and parallel, there seems to be a conspicuous conspiracy with Moore's husband, who is trying to save a poor boy (killing his two parents) Two brothers and two sisters) of the death penalty. Time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to save (even a Jew wander), making the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (did you go to Sunday School? But they taught me that God was love!). IMHO is the short dialogue between the priest John Hurd - who does not seem to take things seriously, which is very bad because he did not give a more important part because his relaxed demeanor is priceless - and the young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore may have registered the same desire as her ex-husband, Bruce Willis: Save the World. He does not save the film for all that.
