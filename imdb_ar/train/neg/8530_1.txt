"Her Cardboard Lover" is the latest film by Norma Shearer. I've left movies, and I think they joined the board at MGM. This was a good step for her. Their "cardboard lover" was attractive and boring in parts. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors who had parts of speaking, so they had a lot of dialogue to talk to keep this turkey standing. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea that a rich woman (Norma Shearer) hired a man (Robert Taylor) to make her fiance Playboy (George Sanders) jealous. I am surprised that director George Cuckur did not cut much of the controversial scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Kokur served Ms. Shearer well in "women" but not in this film. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor made the best performance in the film. During Mr. Taylor's career, he received his best comedy roles in this film and "When the Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942, he performed his best comedic performance in "Her Cardboard Lover" and, until then, his best drama performance. In Johnny Eiger. He had a busy year. Thinking of all the actors at MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all major and minor actresses on the draw. Also, Mr. MGM gave Mr. Taylor all kinds of movies to make - most of them were successful. That is why MGM has kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was as good as a social dog. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve," which won an Oscar for its supporting role. For Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, and it was not very funny and exciting for this comedy. Curiously she made a wonderful comedy in 1939, "Woman" and gave her the best performance. She was obviously older looking for her younger men in "Her Cardboard Lover". Also, it was not helpful to have some of her clothes awful. <br /> <br /> It was not too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic film like their last film, The Wonderful Escape. The same comments about this film can be told about another film, "Personal Property", presented by Mr. Taylor in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was very fresh and boring, and the actress looked old. Mrs. Harlow looked sick throughout the film and no one in Hollywood could tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937 she died at the age of 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.
