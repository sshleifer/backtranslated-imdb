Why, oh, why would not they learn? When you get a nice and exciting exploit trick, use it! Do not mess with trying to get everything deep and thoughtful; you'll just end up looking like a fool. <br /> <br /> Christmas is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw very little mother kissing (Santa Claus) when Santa Claus returns. He was a child. Of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disappointment becomes so great, he turns out, dressed like Santa, walks around the city playing games for good young children, and brutally kills anyone he sees as Shakia. <br /> <br /> Simple enough, not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other horror movies carry the same theme?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be "Santa, a picture of the serial murderer" rather than "Silent Night, Deadly Night." Two-thirds of the film documents Harry's slow but unavoidable collapse, when I wanted to buy the hypothesis by the time the opening headlines were circulating. You know that a tilted film has a problem when you find yourself urging the killer to really go ahead with him. <br /> <br /> Harry's madness may have been convincing in the hands of a qualified director, but unfortunately, we have some men named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and this shows. The action moves abruptly from one scene to another, without creating clear footage of the actors to let us know where we are and what we see. <br /> <br /> Even once the movie starts, we are still treated with Harry's help piles for self-pity, insecurity, and nervous behavior. Most of the blues are scary, evil Christmas is the one to avoid.
