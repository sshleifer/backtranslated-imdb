When I was 11, I had 2 grease like crack. It was a non-class experience, shameful, ecstasy, and powerful addiction. I was my sister and I watched her back and watched her again and again until we lost or we became confused and hostile to stand each other. So, if you are an 11 year old girl and you have reviewed this movie as "gorgeous" or "fun" or "better than original grease", you have your emerging teenagers' hormones to blame them, and you can rest assured that this is inexhaustible Installation will end with absolute garbage. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a young girl, you have no excuse at all to suggest that grease 2 was just an awkward, unusual, unprofessional, and shabby thing for all participants. In its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For criticism, I will honor the film now by explaining the cause of the strikes? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical song, the songs must provide narrative or character evolution. In Grease 2, with some debatable exceptions, music is useless. Most of the songs seem to relate to the overly generalized sexist ("Night Records", "Reproduction", "Do It to Our Country" and "Prowlin") without making a single concrete statement about any of the film's personalities or themes. In addition, all the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the acting team makes it even more like being able to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T birds should be poking, and if that is not at least rather popular, but instead, each one is considered a troubling loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogreely shows Michael on the sacred T-Bird jacket and initiates it to the gang, Michael must kick it on the ground, spit it out, and stick it out to clean any part of his body that has been touched. . But of course, he accepts it as if it is golden because, despite the fact that it is a bunch of trivial auspicious prey, there is no greater honor than being one with T birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is beautiful, intelligent, cute, resourceful and above average (despite his musical disability), Stephanie can eventually embrace him when he reveals himself as the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a rickety gum and crumbs, bubble gum, wearing a dirty shirt dressed in woolen clothes, rude and rude. So, apart from being beautiful (I think), they do not retain any gracious characteristics, and therefore, the masses are given no justification at all for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. <br /> <br /> I could have gone ahead, but I do not want to mention the vile inferiority of her predecessor because there seem to be a lot of cranks that seem to feel such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, for those of you who think you want to go back to this mess for the old time: Grease 2 is a similar experience to re-kiss you first kiss. You are now only 32 years old and you accept a 13-year-old boy with acne bows and cutouts. Magic went and you left feeling forced and disturbed. Trust me.
