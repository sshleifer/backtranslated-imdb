Carlos Menesia yells constantly, violently, shouting "B ** ch!" When women look like shouting "N ** ger!" When black, it is worse. Remember that the word B, unlike the word N, is the only motivational term that is still associated daily with violence. "B ** Chapter!" Is the last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten or killed. This man perpetuates violence by using the language of violence through hatred. It looks like a gay man trying to cover up a woman bashing, so it sounds like a different. What about all the white Nazi men in his audience who give the fascist salute while the stupid white women wearing Bembo wear their hats beside them, clearly terrified to protest against this tide of hatred that hates women. Loaded hee hee. The forgotten bet does not believe or support the freedom of expression! Come Carlos? Do you want women to get freedom of expression to check you out loud and loudly and as loudly as you do, or do you think that "freedom of expression" is reserved for men only to ridicule women ???
