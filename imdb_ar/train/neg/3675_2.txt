Really, everyone in this movie seems like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder, the casting process is not done by the left hand, but not at all. I have seen nothing worse than Natasha McLaughon who somehow sufficed from a client who was carrying a gun. Do not use a pampered look at the city in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is portraying Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also horrifying, and perhaps Hurt is the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did you mention that it was a completely crazy story? Threaten the lives of many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, the reason should be that German (Wheeler) guy? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography may be worse.
