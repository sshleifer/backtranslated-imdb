Greenway films are smart, smart and innovative. However, his style and grammar arise and remind viewers of the films produced in the First World War era of filmmaking: framing, and the use of a medium, fixed camera. It may be good to face mainstream movies in this way but it is not new. Perhaps like that other "innovator," TS Eliot, he draws much of the past more than looking to the future as he does or can the original creator. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest failure in Greenway is that he can not write. His dialogue and even the structure of the land plot and logical but without vitality to one another dramatic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most visible in his mouth, which is gearing up and logical, so the humor has died before it is delivered. The result is tedium: If it is not funny, it fails: Ask the comedian to stand up to justify their behavior if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the readable director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenway used his representatives over the years to act like clones. They speak lines with dull, dreary air like narcissistic teenagers. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is highly appreciated.
