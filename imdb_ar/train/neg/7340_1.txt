impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I have ever seen! I did not like the novel, but it made it worse! Music is very bad, worst actors (apart from the SRK of course, although it does not succeed in saving the film), not much sense. The director makes it seem very confusing, and God knows why ... maybe he is trying to make it seem surrealistic too, but reliable. Well, do not run any of that. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not watch this movie, please! (Say this for your own welfare!) Keep searching, you'll find something else to watch!
