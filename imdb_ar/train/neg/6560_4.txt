"Shadrach" was not my favorite film type. I found that they were overly emotional and had less representation than par. Harvey Keitel and Andy McDowell were good, but some of the other actors were unbelievable at all. Nor did I believe that Paul's parents would go and leave him with the Daphnis, especially when they had a housekeeper at home. Social classes were so far apart that this could not be considered acceptable. Daphni's lifestyle seems to have been exaggerated. There was a scene at the beginning of the film showing Andy McDowell coming out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was he? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? He has nothing to do with the rest of the film and has never hinted at again. It seemed unjustified and inappropriate to the story at all. There were a lot of contradictions in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was nice, but I was not convinced that the Dabnes family was as kind and generous as it was filmed.
