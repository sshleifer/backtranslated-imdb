Raymond Pour plays the role of lawyer in the assassination of his best friend (Dick Furan) thanks to his love for the wife of his friend (Angela Lansbury). It was a full year before he started Perry Mason, so the film might be of particular interest to his fans if that was the inspiration for his voice. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else interesting here though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional and the motives behind her crime in the puzzle are quite clear. There is an impressive performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who also likes "fatme fatale", but Burr's character is fairly clear. It's strange to see a actor like Bor performing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his hand-picked delivery does not match his character here as well as in most of the movies I've seen. There is no mystery at all really supposed to be a complete thrill about the title of the film and the way the character of Burr set up Lansbury's character to implicate herself (a double risk prevents her from being tried again on charges of original homicide, supposedly). He does this by recording a very large bar that you do not notice when you arrive in the room, I think. <br /> <br /> A couple of fun moments may have been unintentionally, and it was possible to do the rest basically a TV.
