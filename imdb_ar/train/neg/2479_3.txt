I learned for the first time about Wendigo many years ago in one of the "scary stories" of Alvin Schwartz: According to that story, Wendigo - after you named your name in the wind - pulls you along, then pulls you to the sky and you crush. Although it seems somewhat strange, Schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" does not. It consists mainly of all the cliches of terror: the family moves into a new home and strange things begin to happen, and everyone who hurt him asks for it, and everyone listens to the old Indian man. I have seen these things so many times that I no longer bother counting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Eric Beer Sullivan (Dewey for "Malcolm in the Center") have done much better than this.
