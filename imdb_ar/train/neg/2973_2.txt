I have a big complaint about this film. <br /> <br /> 1. My local rental store has compiled a very clear soft brick in the "thrill" category. (If I knew what it was, I would not waste my time renting it in the first place, and yes, this film is a soft porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the film. No one in this film does anything that is oblique or obsessed, let alone a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> In fact, he made three major complaints: <br /> <br /> 3 I have watched the movie for some reason for a long time to discover point number 2 in this list. Boy Do you regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my fault. This film has no value on almost every level.
