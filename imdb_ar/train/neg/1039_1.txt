This "movie" is one of the most horrible things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please support yourself and avoid this inefficient fabrication. <br /> <br /> Shake the camera and get the reps you have to adopt Mujahideen is not considered a "trend", which this movie needs in mass. It was not that the writing was wonderful, but that we were left with a group of fully artificial characters, oriented in this artificial way ("the false" documentary style of those who do not know how to direct). <br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it has been Do it cynically to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about filmmaking (which is mostly). <br /> <br /> Too bad, you say a lot about Sundance and what Victor Vargas has been showing there.
