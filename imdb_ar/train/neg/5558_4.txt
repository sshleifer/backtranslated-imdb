I will not take too much time here, I just wanted to mention that Darkman 3 is wonderful. I have all 3 on the DVD and added these to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks first with the best, such as Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars and Die hard, get a point. There is not much good horror, excitement, and there. Thanks a lot to the whole crew and set to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if you wonder how this one came across on DVD. I bought it online, yet it is Region 4, as you know most DVD players in the US are Region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it is the operator of the entire region. Go to Setup and choose Set the charming area you want (1-9).
