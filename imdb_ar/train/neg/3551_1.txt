This movie is just plain terrible! Slow representation, slow access to the point and wooden figures that should not be there. The best part was the screening of Iron Maiden in some of the videos in one of the plays. The finish was worth watching and waiting but that was !! The characters in this film put me on almost sleeping. avoid it!!!
