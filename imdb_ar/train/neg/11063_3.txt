I have the "courage" to tell you to please stay away from the movie "Dahmer", a biography based on the real life story of the serial killer vicious. "Dahmer" is more compelling in relation to the mentality of his subject matter. Jeffrey Damer, who has killed more than 15 young men and eaten some of their bodies, may have been the most unusual serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers in this horrific scene whose heads were supposed to have been examined before deciding to shed light on this horrific project. This is not an easy-to-digest film, although Jeffrey was easy to digest with some vibrant appetizers or even some actual reality. Peel the potatoes'. * Failure
