The first Cube movie was a technical film. It has established a world in which all the main patterns of humanity have been represented and demonstrated how they have struggled to understand a hostile world they can not understand. On the non-literal level, it was the plot of "man against the harsh nature", where the person who looked like innocence and good came in the end, winning a new world that could not be determined after the quarrels of the little man; I rated Cube as out of 10 out of 10, a film that was never meant to have any results. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube was very disappointing. Some ideas were rather wonderful, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the preparation were meaningless and meaningless. However, because I am fairly amusing, I categorize them as 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> While the third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like the reproduction of a B-commercial film less intense than the first No Avatar. There is no "greeting" or "greeting" here; there is nothing but tearing. The same type of plot, with some elements that have been foolishly altered (such as the presence of characters instead of the prime numbers between the cubes - an idea that clearly shows more than anything else that this is contending with no originality at all and nothing to say). <br /> <br /> To see something from "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because the monitors are just part of the big bad experience, and do not hear about the architects. In this film, those who go out (as Kazan did at the end of the first film) are killed - where * bleep * is the meaning of that ?! This is just a stupid 'flip'. I'm glad I did not pay for seeing it. <br /> <br /> The production and acting values ​​in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and ideas are completely devoid of any inspiration that makes this movie just get me rated 3 out of 10.
