This film is a perfect example of a recent horror series that has not been fully realized. There are two ways to take horror movies: either you do not really explain what happens (or who is the killer, like the Texas Shainsu Massacre) or give the characters a lot of stories and background descriptions until everything is explained (Halloween can be an example). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep failed in this area. I see no reason at all to present a small story of Craig's background story without capturing the essence of his character or his motives entirely. No personality is fully understood, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is mostly unpaid and does not offer any of the life offers necessary to make it charming or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that pulls the film. <br /> <br /> This movie will be reduced as another example of a film (as in most) it may be much better though it will never be great. The only thing that was properly used in the film was the setting: characters, story, direction, and writing were very much benefited from face-lift. <br /> <br /> Creep does not serve a purpose as an aspiration, a horror horror film with no intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately, this is about it ...
