I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see the rest. I will record it by saying: <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as "the most fertile man in Ireland" but certainly does not stand there with other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are already funny, like the American-style Kulm Minaiz. But the film itself was filmed completely wrong. Trying to rotate around the camera and zoom in and out give the movie a flashy look as if it were an exciting drama. But it is not. This is Irish lock, stock and two barrels of smoking and you should call it like this. It must have a smooth movement from one shot to another. The film looks dirty and thrown together. <br /> <br /> The shows are okay, given the terrible scenario. A friend of mine told me as if he was following Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He makes a decent show like Dirtbag in Dublin, but in no way compares to his performance in the Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. Was the best performance of Dierdre O'Kane who plays the role of a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been thrown by her husband the bank manager for a young woman. I think she should leave her delicate position and focus more on her representation. <br /> <br /> In general, it does not live up to the expectations of the Irish press. So take it as one of the best Irish movies ever. <br /> <br /> I expect a violent reaction from these comments because most people I spoke to said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Do you think about this film if it is shown in England or America?
