There is a soldier on the side of the road to make sure everyone obeys the speed limit (he does his job); then he attracts a woman who shows she is a mother (there is a child in the back seat); then tells her what is wrong and Bam ... they are killed. Well, this is the beginning of what I thought was personally a good film. When I was watching this movie in the theater I was with some friends. This was our first night after summer so we wanted to go see a good movie. We all decided to see the suspense / excitement that seemed good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I did not spend just $ 7.00 on a movie ticket, but I had to be tortured for the brain. This film began with mystery and suspense and I seriously think "This can not be bad" ... I was very wrong. The whole problem in this film is that it makes no sense. Even if you manage to overcome bad behavior, the story "is not too scary", and most importantly the terrible mess that this film is exposed, you will still be puzzled. Not because you are not smart enough to understand it, because no one with a mind can understand what this stupid movie is about. Now you might think, "Hey man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says." Get what you thought of your head right now! I'm trying to save you the problem of watching this movie by telling you it's so bad that it's useless to think about watching it. Please do not commit people the same mistake that I thought this movie has potential ... no. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I can give a zero I like), and I do not recommend anyone watching this movie at all, you will save yourself many nights that you do not sleep and try to think about. That movie is dripping around.
