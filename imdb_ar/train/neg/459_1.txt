I was looking for a nice and simple comedy to spend time but choosing this movie proved to be a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a single good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, as it relies on tired, recycled jokes and an annoying tortoise for laughter. In my book, this is not funny, it is pathetic. <br /> <br /> "Low budget" effects (even if I can call them effects) with terrible cinematic portrayals. In many places, it looks like a Cindy movie without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richards desperate for some money they have agreed to participate in? (Considering their last film, it seems so.) Despite the clothes, Pamela shows her age and fullness, so she does not encounter it exciting, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even in bad bad class is funny. It's just bad, as if everyone was involved. <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
