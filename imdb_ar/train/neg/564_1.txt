Producers made a big mistake in casting Mark Leicester, who could not play or sing, starring. Apart from the very bad "acting", Leicester was singing to be called a girl. I do not know why they threw it at all, because there were a lot of boys who could play a better role without limits and they also sang. Shani and Alice were too big to play Nancy, who was supposed to be only 16 years old. The current version of West End is much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best dowry of all time, and certainly better than Jack Wilde. It was clear that it was political to give these old musical Oscar many Oscars after the bustling events of 1968.
