I wondered why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until I saw the film. Bad plot, bad science, bad representation and generally a bad film. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original War Games if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I did not like to bend the plot to overcome the idea of ​​terror threat. In the first film created in WO.P.R because Russia had thousands of warheads directed to the United States. Aside from politics, one of the good things in the first film was to highlight that even a stupid computer could realize the idea of ​​useless war in the end. Such insight is not presented in this film.
