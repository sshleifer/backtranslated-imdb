I was resentful of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This film sucked down right! It lacked the charm of the first. In fact you can understand every word spoken by mice, cartoon crappy, the palace is very different from the first film, there are new characters not mentioned before and were bad, and fortunately the prince did not have many lines that kept him from dumb sounding. Basically its like a 1 1/2 king lion except for its various stories all narrated from mice. The reason I give this is 2 out of 10 because the songs that were not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.
