The text is very funny ... and this in turn makes the actors' lines look strong, unrealistic and unbelievable. There is a repetition of the phrases - "my sweet little daughter" and simple forms of that line that comes to mind ... it's just a dirty soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the music is too wrong! In addition, the "theme" of the main blues is terribly strange and completely wrong for this purpose. And feel over-used mostly because the organs of this appearance and texture and arrangement never changes, even when the emotional context of the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Thus, whenever it appears, it looks like a painful inflammation as if it were a major transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The sophistication of music, it seems as though the writer was writing music for soap or a comedian - the Canadian Canadian low-budget comedic at the time - that makes it feel like we're always about to throw a commercial. <br /> <br /> This is a fatal mistake, and there is a lot of exaggeration which is so real stretch that many of these characters use only one type of New York accent - thick Bronx tone. I do not know whether the issue is about the limited ability of actors to know only one New York dialect - or whether it is about the director's ability to observe such a blatant anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an amateur script with its brilliant lines that make this movie "whole" ... a blow. When any foundation is shaken and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without flaws that reveal themselves in more harmful and less disturbing ways.
