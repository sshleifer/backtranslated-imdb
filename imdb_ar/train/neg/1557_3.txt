The film is basically a boring series of appalling cliches that do not offer a true cultural vision. The eastern part of the trip is described in a particularly disturbing way: it is clear that there are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women wearing black robes and oriental dancers. I wonder how camels and palm trees were missing from the whole picture. The character of the two main characters is a very sketchy sketch and many positions are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea may be interesting, but at the end of the day if you're looking for a cultural vision, you have to skip this film.
