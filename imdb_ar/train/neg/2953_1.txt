These reviews claim that this movie is very bad. This film does not enjoy the bad deeds of Leonard Bart 6, Bethfield Earth and Gigi. Those films were amusing in their horrors but the pile of dinosaur dung was very bad. I have not been in this severe pain to watch a bad movie since I saw Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a bust worth $ 35 million. New Line Cinema refused to enter cinemas. They reduce the loss of sending it directly to the video, making it the most expensive direct film to video in decades. Whoopi surrendered to be in this disaster after huge salaries. <br /> <br /> Plot: A millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can fire rockets at the sun to kill humanity and start another ice age. A policeman named Katie Coltrane and an idiot dinosaur called Theodore Rex reluctantly cooperate to stop him after the death of a friend dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The plot is presented to you at the beginning of a movie that steals a movie with all its pleasure. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually very awful. Whoopi looks troubled and tries to support her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is very upset and his weary behavior wears five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hit his tail (by chance and intentionally). I thought Burgler was bad but it needed Theodore Rex, the worst film in the career of Whoopi. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that this monster is bad enough to be fun. I did not see it when I watched this movie. All I saw was the wreck of a train written by people who must have some admiration for the disease for the Howard Duck movie. Humor at this level seems Theodore Rex as Barney's cousin. Completely painful from start to finish.
