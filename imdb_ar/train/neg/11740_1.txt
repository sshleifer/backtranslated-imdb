George Sanders' terrible vehicle is positively transformed from being a thief to a police czar. <br /> <br /> While Sanders had a wonderful role in character, he was certainly not a prominent man and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> He is beyond stupidity. Jane Lockhart did not offer some comedian satisfaction until he caused him a moment of anger in launching his weapon tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and his co-star, Carole Landis, committed suicide in real life. After making a pitiful movie as such, it is not awful. <br /> <br /> The usual attractive Signe Hasso is not really something here.
