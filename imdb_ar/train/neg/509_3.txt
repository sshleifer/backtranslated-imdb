This film revolves around British POWs from World War II fleeing a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find the Wooden Horse boring. The subject could have been exciting, stabilizing and feeding adrenaline, but the "wooden horse" was said very clearly. It is a collection of simple and unpleasant events, without comment and suspense. The first half clearly shows how prisoners of war dug up tunnels, but the events were very clear, with not enough mistakes and a haircut to make me on the edge of the abyss. The last half of the film is worse, they move from place to place without chasing the cat and mouse. Can the characters speak a bit and talk more of the action in Action! I am disappointed because of the Wooden Horse, I missed the possibility of being a great film.
