I have to say that this movie is mork and mindi stops, when i watch it i got chills, but i've wet myself a bit. When this Korean man started with the spiders in his neck kicking people, you like the Asian masters smell the smell and suck them because they eat dogs all the time. In any way to get back on track, Chuck had a rather terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non-robotic man. Some people compared her in his previous days when he was a car wash analyst and believed in the Holy Ghost and the ghost of last Christmas. This movie is very bad. I put my newly born baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris' mailbox. He can raise my child and I do not allow him the world where Chuck Norris is believed to be an expert in karate. Let him see something like this breakthrough in real life for the rest of his life.
