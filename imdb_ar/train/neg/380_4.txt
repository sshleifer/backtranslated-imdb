I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this film. It's a big joke. Good .. It's amusing .. You can see the most stupid plots played very seriously in the form of a film .. I wonder about the audience that the target of this film mainly. <br /> <br /> Priety is an alternative mother to a happy Salman / Rani couple who want a child but can not. I wonder how it would be if this drama is a real distraction from the life of the real couple. <br /> <br /> Rani looks happy with another beautiful lady in her home brought to have a baby. Her and Salman. She cares about her and tries to push her husband Salman to Preti so they have some romance. When the public tired of jokes in Salman. <br /> <br /> Although the time is unprecedented, this movie is unbearable. silly.
