I've been through a friend for some time now (to choose a lot of the most awesome horror movies in the video store to entertain in an evening.) For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably against v. Cheap). <br /> <br /> Cheap Soundtracks There are also some very entertaining scenes, including a scene in which a man attacks and defends himself with a number of improbable things, making me laugh at the time (does not seem very funny later but there you go). < But it may be worth watching if you like movies like "Chopping Mall." Yes, I've seen it. That too.
