Doppelganger enjoys its moments, but it is few and far between. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a combination of Grade B of popular excitement and the story of ghosts and horror. Drew Barrymore plays the role of a young woman chased by her past demons (most of her family members were killed, and in at least one case, the main suspect), or is she suffering from a really bad case of multiple personalities disorder? George Newburn is her new roommate, and most events focus on him. <br /> <br /> The character of Newburn is very sympathetic, and he and Barrymore do a good job (although it is not quite good). It seems that the average to (at times) scenario is quite shocking and the ineffective guidance has been combined to sink the rest of the presentations into oblivion. Leslie Hop's personality is memorable, but it's so annoying that you'll want to forget it. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy eventually breaks down in a form (from a cruel story of psychological realism, and the other is supernatural horror), a strange climax that was designed, photographed and filmed so badly that it effectively addresses most of the film's previous value. <br /> <br /> In general, the film feels what might be expected to be the first movie by M. Knight Shamalyan. The representation and text of the minors make it good enough to make you care about them - at least until the film gets out of its way completely and completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid meeting someone first.
