A diligent comedy that has IE. R. The client Tony Randall who is investigating with the eccentric farm family in Maryland who has never paid her taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the girl's girl farmer who puts pressure on the uninteresting tax man. Debby certainly made her share of the poor sitcom play during this period - and this is no better or worse than the rest. The picture begins brightly but the flags are halfway up and become hectic and unskilled. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the car itself is defeating chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H. E. Bates, with a mix of poor sound that makes all actors seem to be stuck in a room echoing sound. ** from ****
