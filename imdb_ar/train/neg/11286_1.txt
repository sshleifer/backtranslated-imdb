Where do you begin with such a bad film? <br /> <br /> Do you remember representatives of unwanted heroes? Over-representation? Horrific scenario? <br /> <br /> No. You just say that anyone who pays the money to see a bad film needs to see it. I know I do. I respect these poor men who saw it as a word of introduction from mags like Empire (usually a bad sign if the preview version is not available for high-quality movies). However, cinemas should really start thinking about refunding refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after opening it with two other colleagues. The only other person in the cinema was a single blow of his own. <br /> <br /> That was a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the ad campaign has failed horrically or the word has spread through most of the country that is a person who smells foul. <br /> <br /> The Avengers have not changed a few days since watching a movie. If your friend is talking about this in a video within a few months, be sure to pay your electricity bill while watching it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking her - or getting out of the group; Keith Allen retains some dignity amidst the film carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested while performing his performance; Rhys Ifans is not a favorite after the success of Notting Hill, Behr is the only lover in the middle of the road as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> Your interest, you used to be in the Word, any viewers' expectations of their ability to represent should be pretty low to begin with. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not bad given the clearly limited budget but this text is very bad. If you want to hear a bunch of unwanted characters, say "Fak!" For a few hours, this must be true in your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles should be needed. <br /> <br />
