Honestly, where can I start! This was a low budget, and it was a great film, it was very cowardly, which made us all burst into laughter to what extent we were completely backward! The sword fighting scenes were not fighting the sword, but they were playing with some plastic swords they had bought at Wal-Mart, and all they were doing was just whining to try to make it look as if they were fighting !! My family and I were in the mood for a really great movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one movie, and there was the movie Saw Sawtooth Island. I mean it was very wonderful, but when we saw it at home, it died practically after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Hey, movie plot, storyboard, script, etc. Of garbage that I do not even know why the director and producer waste their time in making it !! But if you get stuck on this movie..Not get it !!!!!
