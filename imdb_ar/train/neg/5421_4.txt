This is one of those topics that I can relate to a little more than most people because I hate hype and have no idea how they are in big cities, especially New York, how people ever sleep! It amazes me that people can afford all the hype there these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting subject. It's too bad and that's about it. Tim Robbins is considered fit, although with the exception of a few scenes (especially with the absolute model model looking for Margarita Leva), it seems he was not quite there. My greatest hope in this film is that representatives of acting will see the stunning and very talented actor of the take-off, Margarita Leviva. She does not have much to do, but she's a pretty model. Even when trying to take a look at the neighboring girl. It saddens me that there could be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world who do not have the skills or the recoverable talents, to get fame and success more than this talented beauty. I did not care much about this film because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I've seen some new talent. I hope the producers and directors in Margarita think when they need a beautiful new actress to be in a big budget movie. If they can make Megan Fox a star (she's not hot, and her "talent" is worse than Disney TV) from a single movie, it should happen easily for her, because she's gorgeous and has talent! I recommend changing her last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. In the hope that this will make her career, and if there is any justice, she can appear in a big summer movie or two films in the next few years.
