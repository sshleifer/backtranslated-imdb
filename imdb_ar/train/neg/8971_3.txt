After the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and overcoming the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in a trilogy, Prequel Cube Zero. <br /> <br /> In the depths of the bowels of a giant and nameless institution, space and time are unknown, Win (Zachary Bennett) and David (Hubband) sit and watch the behavior of the observers. Placed in a giant network of cubic rooms, some of which are forged with death traps. He told us that the people watching them were convicted criminals who had chosen this terrible or deadly disease for a lethal injection. They had no problem with their jobs until Wayne, a sports genius, discovered that a prisoner, Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) Cube. Suddenly, we realized that their "jobs" may not be as they seem, and they may be part of something that is deeply ill and twisted ... <br /> <br /> For people who have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this may not be Brikwell as you wish. It's not that the story has no potential; it's simply that the first Cube never needs to be expanded. Standing alone, it is a small and elegant psychic excitement with very interesting concepts and confirmation of his message. It was also nicely self-contained. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the original puzzle, in an attempt to answer questions more questions but actually creates chaos for what needs no repair. <br /> <br /> What this new film has to ask, questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and tyranny of evil, are certainly good questions to ask, but perhaps it should have been done on the merits, rather than a continuation of a film that was not He has these aspirations. <br /> <br /> After saying this, other features of the film, such as acting, direction and writing, are not terrible. There is a dark and dark look of the film, which is like the movie "The Matrix" and "The Dark City", and they certainly managed to recover the horror of the first cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to keep.
