I read the book a long time ago and do not remember the plot specifically, but I remember that I enjoyed it. Since I was sick on the couch, it seemed a good idea and oh !! It's a life-long film. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with actors and representatives of class B. <br /> <br /> Female actors were selected directly from desperate housewives. I have never seen the show, but there are a lot of commercials for this show and I get the essence. Is there nothing original anymore? Certainly, but not for life. <br /> <br /> All male actors are fairly active and representative but girls need to have husbands I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a female struggles with a male, her life, and what to do ?? Kick him in the testicles. What then? Women love it but let me tell you something about girls ... It was not as easy as always in appearance. <br /> <br /> It was not bad. I got chills a couple of times, so I have to figure it out for someone.
