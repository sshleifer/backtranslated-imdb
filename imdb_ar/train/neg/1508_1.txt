I watched this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and do not know what kept me in my seat. I guess I expected that the film with Gir would have some value in it eventually, but nothing of value was displayed on the screen. The story is a silly excuse to pile up shot after a shot of bondage and torture. There is no character in the film doing anything like real life. The "cutting" method relies on jumping, mini-back and overprinting to give weight to this rotten setting of a gang of sadists who seem to be working for free for years, and the surprise that the leader is a "victim" of a murderer executed. I do not see how Gir, a Buddhist, engaged in this violent sexual litter.
