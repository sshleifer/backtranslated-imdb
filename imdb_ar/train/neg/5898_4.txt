Basically, take the concept of each horror Asian horror movie and destroy it in one movie and get this movie. The story is like this: a group of college students get voice messages from their own phones that predict their death. There are some things that happen with ghosts, which if you've seen any Asian ghost movie, it's not scary now. This film was quite disturbing because it was a clichéd. It is the same clown, a different film. <br /> <br /> The acting was good. Unfortunately, actors are placed in a very reverberating position, so nothing we have not seen in the past. The two main actions have been strong. <br /> <br /> As far as gore is concerned, there is not much. We get a wonderful sequence that includes a crooked arm (I do not know how to explain it), but it was cut so you could not see anything except the final result. You see some blood sometimes, including the cropped and zombies (which looks really great and I've added), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The fears in the film are few and widespread, and this is really not scary. You'll get some scary pictures sometimes, but it's not enough to think of something scary. There is nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them scared me either. This is really the fall of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if fear is not delivered, this is not good. <br /> <br /> As for guidance, Takashi Miki is still doing a good job. He seemed a little tame in this film compared to his previous films, but he still portrays much of his corrupt style. There was a lot of pictures like Miike (including a scene with a set of jars from dead embryos), and it seems that another 15 to 20 minutes from Miike then the rest of the film. However, the film is defective due to its irregularity. <br /> <br /> I recommend this only to the huge people in the Asian horror movies (even if you are as well, I can recommend much better) or the Miike adult fans. Warning for those wishing to enter Miike, this is not his best job. <br /> <br /> I give it number 4 because it's just modest. Maybe if this was released 4 or 5 years ago, it might be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like to see Asian horror movies quickly and quickly. How does it happen if an Asian horror movie is supposed to be good here (US)? Many of these films are the equivalent in Japan for Scream and Urban Legends and I know what I did last summer here in the 1990s. If you have seen one, you have seen them all. Many of these films rely heavily on horror and images that, if they do not present the concerns they are designed to do, are not good, and nothing will change that. More Asian horror movies should be more like the Odyssey and Tale of Two Sisters. If they do not scare you or scare you, at least they have great stories, action, direction, cinematography, and much more to support them. Two movies are not just great horror movies, but movies are great in general. More Asian horror movies need to be like these instead of clichés, "The ghost just wants to find it even revolves around killing people through their phones / video / home / electrical appliances / water pipes / Google search engine / vibrator / etc."
