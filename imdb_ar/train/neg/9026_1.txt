This must be some of the worst direction I have seen. The close-up shot can be very powerful shot, but when each scene is made up of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its effect. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has very beautiful landscapes to work with, the backdrops of Mexico, the quintets, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities where Costner travels on his journey of revenge. Unfortunately, we only picked up a quick glimpse of these places before the camera turned into a picture of a big and giant head. Even the transition scenes led by Costner alone across Mexico quickly. <br /> <br /> The result was too extreme and intrusive, dictating all the feelings we should feel. The story itself should have been dealt with better. Among other things, a lot of people pop up from nowhere to help Costner along - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting story, but many others took the same premise and did great things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a fairly similar story, but it was a much better film. <br /> <br /> The end was completely antagonistic and suffered the most melodramatic points in the film. This movie will never be great, but if we see more Mexico and less giant heads, this film might be watchable.
