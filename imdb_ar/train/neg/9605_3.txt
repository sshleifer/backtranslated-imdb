This Italian film of the seventies of the last century is not present in classes with dog soldiers, or howl, or even the terrible American wolf in Paris, but it is good to see. I'm talking about watching a leading actress, an amazing blonde, running in her birthday dress. We're talking about cartoons, full nudity ... obviously she is a real blonde ... Houma Houma Houma !! The story screams, and SFX childish, produces representation (for the most part). The only value to redeem this movie is nudity scenes and sex (and there are many). Tame by HBO standards, but it's still fun to see when you find yourself without an appointment on a Saturday night. Well ... here is the spoiler ... There is no wolf in the wolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine 's predecessor.) The girl imagines that she is an anointed ... In other words, Lycantrop is my bed.
