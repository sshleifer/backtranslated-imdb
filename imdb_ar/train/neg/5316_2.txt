Throw this lame bone dog. Sooo bad ... you may see anyway. Cole (Ross Hagen) is a bad intergalactic man escapes from his exhilaration The captain of a very excited spacecraft (Jean-Michael Vincent) Cole managed to steal a shuttle crash the Earth on Earth. The robot killer is sent unstoppable to bring the dead or alive villain. John Philippe Le, a forest guard / parker, urges caution in dealing with these visitors from afar. Fashion is outrageous and the scenario lacks intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of effort. Also in the staff: Diana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
