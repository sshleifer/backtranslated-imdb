This series has ups and downs sometimes, and the latter is the case, here. There is an acceptable amount of sprays, with an innovative implementation of the stroller's weapons, but the editing film is seriously dismantled, making the film itself tougher than usual. Sometimes, the action slows down in crawl as the camera follows the silent roaming of the "cub", which is almost lost early. All in all, disappointment. <br /> <br /> However, there is oriental quality spaghetti for music and motion that may have the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of her time following the simple adventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death that his father opened for him.
