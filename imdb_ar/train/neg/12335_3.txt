Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the class of actors I always want to see, despite reviews. I have always found that Ms. Ryan is a charming and profitable actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Klein is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because of this film. <br /> <br /> First, Meg Ryan does not play a beloved character. She plays a modest, weak will that begins to scream your nerves soon after the opening credits and gives up only a few days later. However, the character of Kevin Klein is more disturbing and less tender. So, even if you love these two actors naturally, I recommend you pass this movie.
