I have not read a book "wrinkle in time". To be quite honest, after watching the film, do I really want? Well, I should not review this film, so I'll start with it. After that I will say that the TV movie is forgettable. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you he was forgotten. To be perfectly honest, there will be no better TV movie than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a television movie? I have not written a review for anyone before. Well, I'll just say they usually have some celebrities. Wrinkles in time include only one. Alvary Woodard (or Woodward, not sure), an Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The movie contains special cheesy effects, an interestingly mild plot, and scenes that make you go "WTF". The film is very bad and makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It is a television movie. It is usually not good. As is this one. Wrinkles in time are a waste of time and a great time for time. For the first time, you'll probably forget the second thing that's over. Well, maybe it was not the second. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Wrinkles in time: * / ****
