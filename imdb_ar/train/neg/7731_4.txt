The comparison is probably unfair, but inevitable. Those attracted to the depth and depth of umbrellas will be horrified by the discovery of a broken musical play and paste it into the American way - an embarrassing and frightening dialogue with unaccountable numbers of singing and dancing. It is clear that the French dialect of Jean Kelly was very bad, as the horrible dubbing function was replaced (as you remember, the dubbing was ideally copied in umbrellas). The translation of the French language (for localized versions) leaves nothing to be desired, although it can not be attributed to Demy. The film also contains many self-conscious moments that come at the start of worrying, such as references in songs to LeGrand itself. Fashion - Well, mix tight pants / white shoes, horrible unnatural colors, remember one Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demi rewards the viewer with hints of umbrellas; note, for example, the bag that Maxens carried on his departure from Rochefort - this is the same bag that Jay carried on his departure from Cherbourg. Also note "comfortable brunette of decision" - Madeleine in umbrellas, and in the young girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect a natural sense of parachute umbrellas (you can save a floating bike scene), or search for similar deeper questions and obscure ends as in parachute text, may have to go through this one p. Those looking for a French version of the 1960s American music will be very happy.
