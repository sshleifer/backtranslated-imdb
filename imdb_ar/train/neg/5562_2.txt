This unpleasant film has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren performs better than this script or other motion movies. There are occasional snippets of dialogue suggesting that the film may have been able to offer some ideas about a strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. The motives are either vague or vulgar. Most representation is substandard. The script creates unnecessary confusion. The irresistible fascination of a director focusing on gore distracts attention. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.
