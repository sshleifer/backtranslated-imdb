Well, what to say. The golden child is in the category "Too bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes very annoying) lines, but you're still enjoying it. Chales Dance was never worse than his role as a villain Sardo Nomspa (what is the name of this name ???). <br /> <br /> Who should see the golden child ... they are ... hard to say, but my best guess will be those who love embarrassing movies and can enjoy bad behavior, bad plot and more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
