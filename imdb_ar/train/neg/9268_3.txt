Going to school Delia takes care of local bullying by pushing the big man to wet himself in front of all his classmates. Later, when his father threatened Yorkers with a lawsuit, he was beheaded in a traffic accident! Delia is someone you never mess with if you know what is good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the father of Dalia Jane becomes a big man in the town alone, or so believes, through his election to Congress the champion of clean air and green trees crowd instead of allowing smog and concrete boys to control the neighborhood with his eye Now on the White House itself! Does his strange and alien daughter Delia have anything to do with the sudden wealth of Jane York? <br /> <br /> Then just when Joe was appointed, Anne Herne, as an educator at Delia, shows the truth about her strange and evil country. the authorities. Joa New Age type realizes that Delia is a little strange, having turned all of her white crystals into black, and invites her to New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come and check them. Noah feels very upset about what he sees in the colorful Delia Kirilian vibrations, all in black and blue with a little red, so much so that he almost collides with Delia's car. <br /> <br /> On a trip to one of Jo Delia's psychic clowns, the entire event turns into hell putting the place, through mental telepathy, on fire and urging everyone to run for cover, including the poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up Up in the leg.

It is not only anti-Christ who is afraid of revelation is his twin sister! Her brother AntiChrist himself is about to come to the scene as her unborn little brother Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times more than enough to return AntiChrist to Earth to bring Armageddon. The film he was putting on the audience was already tired of him and his evil adventures. With a fourth really is not necessary since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, has died and been buried for years. Developed through the usual contest without anyone believing that Delia small is "thee" against Christ so too late to prevent her in her deadly rounds of destruction of the whole human race. The film is as bad as it is too long, 97 minutes, for a horror point that could have told her that the story was at least 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Get a special eye, Earl Knight, the learned chail, then the sister of the former Catholic nun Yvonne, Megan Lech, and now the Wizard of Faith Felicchi in the film only to kill did not help in the plot too. It lengthens the suffering of those watching the film. You can see the surprise ending once the film "Omen IV" appears, where the rules are cleared for Delia's eventual capture of the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a little upset was Delia doing it with little help from friends.
