Cartoon Network seems desperate for ratings. Starting with the uninstallation of Samurai Jack, the network seemed polite to remove all the popular shows, such as Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragonball Z, and so on. Offers modest. Although Total Drama Island / Action & Chouder stands out because of her writing and admiration for her audience, there are plenty of other shows that either reproduce it horribly (George the Jungle) or tear apart other shows, such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, Personalized the title just like Spongebob, then there's the Johnny Test, which is a substitute for the Dexter's Laboratory, although it's much more than just a chunk of anything. <br /> <br /> The exhibition's characters were clearly derived from Dexter's Lab, only this time focusing on Johnny, a blonde (or firefighted) character tormenting his twin sisters, Susan and Mary, who just talked to look like Dexter, Orange, to glasses, impossible technology. There is even a rival genius named Bling Bling Boy or Eugene, and apparently he was sitting for Mandrake. Then there's Dookie, Johnny's best friend and talking dog, one of Dexter's experiments ... I mean the experiences of Susan and Mary Early. <br /> <br /> Dexter's laboratory may have been one of the best cartoons on television, with its simplicity, but an effective art style, a beloved main character, and rings that do not seem to pull long. Johnny test is much different. The style of art here is hardly fun. In fact, it looks absolutely awful. Characters have motives that make them annoying or hateful. Such as how most episodes of the series consist of a Johnny and Duckie search for a havoc on a neighborhood girl Sissy, whom Johnny secretly likes, or a twin obsession over a nearby boy. Seeing these geniuses is surprising when you see the absolute value and the fact that Johnny seems to be someone you do not want to link to at all, there is no real link between the scenes and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing serially takes great advantage in his name is that Johnny is a Guinea Pig Susan and Mary for their experiences. These range from turning Johnny into fat, ugly, brutal, and even into a woman. He then helps Johnny's twin plan for his services. Whenever there is a ring that includes this type of "win / win" deal, it usually seems to be reversed, and those that do not go out of line never end satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The writing range from the average to the phonetic, however. The "Fat" loop repeats constantly "It's gone through PH, there's a difference, as you know." A line that should never be repeated, especially when this episode seems to promote child obesity. Johnny has become a famous star of money and video games once he gets fat. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how the program looks completely torn off Dexter's lab. The program appears in many characters, from two black men named Mr. Black and Mr. White, a military general who seems to need to solve all his problems through Johnny and his sisters, and a lot of super bad guys, though here, the show again steals ideas for other sources , Such as Clone Freeze teen, evil cat with personal server wants cats to rule man (like evil evil cat from Powerpuff Girls), crazy madman mastermind, trio "dude dude" and "mole man", who may be the most villain clich√© in the media . <br /> <br /> To top it all, along with the ugly cartoon characters and unwanted characters, the vocal representation is either acceptable (eg Mr. Black and Mr. White) to just a split of the ear (Johnny, Dookie, In the display). It seems that the distinctive song is the only attractive thing for this show, but then it was rebuilt with a few episodes with a band just destroyed. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, Johnny Johnny is not a good cartoon. His horrific references to teen culture will distract young children from the show, while his bright colors, torn personalities and falling rings will ruin the experience of teenagers. It's just another of those crazy shows that Cartoon Network is working too hard to fool people into watching it (like MTV towards rap). If you need a presentation that satisfies your children for half an hour, it is best to stick to Spongebob, because John Test is a "test" of patience more than anything else.
