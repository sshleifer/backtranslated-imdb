The Stella Dallas movie of 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck was not very good - how did anyone think that an almost updated version of the story would now work in a puzzling way? They may have thought cheerfully and brilliantly, Betty Medler could make something cheerful, but this comic text defeats her. The plot that revolves around a female waiter who has a child outside of marriage, and years later gives the young girl her rich father so you will get a chance for a better life, and can not escape the decorations and emotions old fashioned. Midler works best with a film director who can control her transgressions, but that does not happen here; Stephen Collins is the strong guy who changed her life, but Terrini Alvarado is the daughter of Medler. This is what was referred to as "the image of women", which is popular, but does not pass a crowd because it remains very loyal to its origins in the thirties. * 1/2 of ****
