I realized from watching the European horror film, especially the films prepared by Jesse Franco's sectarian star, that you can not expect a plot of great meaning. However, Franco has gone with this film. Despite the surreal atmosphere and reputation of the film as one of the best directors, Succubus is a very bad film. I must admit that I saw the broken American version, which lasts about 76 minutes; but unless that is the logic that has been made, I am sure that the longest European version is boring. The plot has to do with a woman wandering around; practicing S & M and talking about garbage, and it's all really boring. There is no surprise and dull sex, most of the run-time is handled through boring dialogue and although this film is short; it has difficulty reaching the end. I must say that the sites look good and that Franco has done a good job using surrealism; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director making some classic trash movies - but this film seems to have been made for money, and I generally recommend going over it and watching some of the most exciting director's work.
