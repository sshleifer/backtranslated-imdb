Very bad, I really love Christine Clark and Gary Bossi. But the manager failed to put this together. There is a lot of work, a lot of promises, but it all comes away. The director did not work. Promising work comes off lame. It seems a lot fascinated by a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV dating back to 1996) simply does not deserve the time to watch it. Another manager was doing a better job.
