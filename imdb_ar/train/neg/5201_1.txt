The story has been seen before, but it does not matter if you can find the right story. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on the work board. Besides this, the photographer spent a lot of time in the corners do not match the letter of the film. But the funniest thing is that if you take a look at the location of the movie, you can read that the filmmaker deliberately chose to produce the film with bad camera angles. It reminds us of fishing. But I have never heard of fishing at poor camera angles ;-) I will have one star because the story is fine. It's a pity that T. West did not spend more time to review his story. It seems like the film was more important than planning. Because your camera does not mean that you should produce a movie immediately ... Come. Everyone can produce a movie, but not everything will be good. So the word Tip to Ti West is: Stop what you want. Take advantage of your time to start planning and not to shoot until everything appears on the action board. You certainly have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
