Unfortunately, Mary Haroun decided to present a fictional account of Betty Beg's life to keep up with her own issues with men. As usual in all her work, each male character is depicted as weak, humble or crooked. To add to her imagination, she publishes incorrect ideas and issues, according to Bettie Page itself. Betty did not leave this subject because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she was born again later in life, through the influence of her third husband - a minister). She left her, because she was in her late thirties, did not perform her acting career anywhere, and felt that she was losing her appearance. The hints of harassment and rape are not artificial and deny Betty's words - attempts by the director to claim that any woman who has done what Betty has done must be a victim of men. Aaron failed to point out that Betty designed her own clothes in almost all her buds (she was not handed over by "two sick" makers). Harron also failed to show that Bunny Yeager, who had filmed many of Bettie's famous photos, also filmed many "naughty" photos with Bettie and was not a moralist in the film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other documentaries more accurate and honest in her life and people in it.
