In the 1990s, day-to-day dialogue programs began to appear left and right. Each network has one, all lacking one thing of originality. Ricky Lake was just another show of entertainment for the mother of obesity in a trailer park with a Marlboro cigarette dangling from her mouth as one of her children breast-fed dozens of illiterate illiterate children. English and other basic pillars of mankind where this destroys indicates existence. Titltes range from girl you head dove and so on. How can anyone want to see this absolute clean garbage? Has our society really become more than a handful of Billy Hill's dead fathers? The people who appeared in this exhibition are trash. People who viewed this show are trash. Anyone who wants to watch this show being streamed or put on a DVD is TRASH. People wonder why the Americans have become huge piles of fat and fat so they do not get jobs, and such offers tell them it's good to be 500 pounds and 12-year-old girls like prostitutes. Having such a trash on television has ruined morality.
