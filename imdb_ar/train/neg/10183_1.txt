This is one very awesome production. The general consensus has always been that, although Princess Margaret may have been pampered and perhaps more revealing than the luxury she had at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point in production, the actress failed to explain it. It also seems that the production budget can not be extended to a hairdresser - from the very beginning, the hair on Princess Margaret's character had a permanent nest of birds in a state of disarray and looked as though she had been dragged across a shrub. The actor who played the role of the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremer imitate Prince Charles and was a hilarious. <br /> <br /> Production was a fragile, shabby, garbage-laden burden. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
