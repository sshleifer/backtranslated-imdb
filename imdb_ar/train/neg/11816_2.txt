It's hard to happen in the frozen space for 15 years. Falling into a star ... unlikely. Falling in on a day goes Supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. Get saved by a ship at the time ... priceless. <br /> <br /> No, it's not the gold heart of Zaphod Beeblebrox. Nor are they recipients of the "Origin of the Year" award. After her daughter was sentenced to solitary confinement for two years on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encouraged her to submerge her and walk alone with the strange man she had picked up. This foreshadows their pride in hand-to-hand combat, which forms the bulk of the film. The most prominent battles include, for example, psychological talk face-to-face with a woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at about six inches, which pleases obliging in the line of fire. <br /> <br /> In the end, a family of three leave a ship that was planning to use it to monitor the supernova until the last minute because it is too slow to escape the wave of explosion, instead using a ship of psychologists who supplied fuel in one minute With 1600 pounds of gas driven from a 0.7-kiloton rocket. You'll love those hard scientific statistics! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as an inappropriate gift, it will continue to produce movies that are not suitable for viewing at 3 am on Sci Fi.
