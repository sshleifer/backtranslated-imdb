The serum revolves around a mad doctor who finds an outlet that is supposed to heal all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates a kind of beast that needs to eat human flesh and brain. Madness creates some zombie bodies and has some problems. There is very long progress in all events with many scenes that introduce you to the characters. The nephew of the mad doctor was caught in a car accident and the mad document tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a C class movie with a good representation but some routing problems and some persistence errors. There is not much zombie action in this, and the effects, though adequate, are not special. You can progress quickly through slow parts and get some fun from motion scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.
