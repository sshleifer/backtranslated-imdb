I caught this in the testing test. All I can say is: What the hell? This movie is displayed as smoothly as the Mickey Mouse script reads for "Scarface". It is more strange than just feeling the slightest sense. Even if you leave your mind in the car, the film is still so strange that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot includes crocodile hunter Steve Irwin as he attempts to "rescue" a crocodile containing the CIA probe. The CIA comes after Irwin to retrieve the investigation, and Erwin makes a mistake in trying to catch the hunters, and begins to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> This is all about the story there; the rest is an embodiment of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely strange sequences of motion. At some point, Irwin mounts up with an RV and a knife fighting with a CIA agent above him. Yes, that's right: knife Steve Irwin fights a man over a RV. Let this be your guide to this bad film.
