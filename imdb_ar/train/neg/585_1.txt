The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best films I've ever seen, and it's almost perfect. The story of a lady and tramp in two ways: rich girl / poor boy, and capacity versus blood strain. However, the sequel is not just a slut attempt to take advantage of the good original name but also the absurd and exaggerated Disneyfied mess that has been summarized as "Rambo meets the black stallion". Without the magic of the black stallion. The young hero returns from a three-year absence, and suddenly Superman becomes a horse-rider; in the original good film, he was real and a friend, but he unfortunately turned into a caricature in the film. I was barely disappointed in a film, and sometimes this thing angered me - I missed clich√©s. Crowd Audience Audition - Do studio heads believe that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is to put the beautiful horses in front of them, to make them happy? A mess movie.
