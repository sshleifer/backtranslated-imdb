The wicker man has done impossible! Cat Woman was replaced as the worst modern film in the mind of cinema in the steel trap. Yes it is really that bad. So bad that when I sat down to write this review, I thought to myself "If I have a choice either to see this movie again or to have red hot needles in my eyes," I might actually go to the red hot needles. <br /> <br /> Neil Labot has created a rare film where Joel Schumacher can sit down and say with all comfort and guilt-free mind, "Yes, that's a very bad trend there." <br /> <br /> I think the first idea for myself should have been the tagline: "Some sacrifices must be made." Sure, it may seem a bit of an ominous line to interest you, but the sacrifice will all be on the public side of the screen. In this regard, the people responsible for this film should be charged with hate crime ... or at least fraud to try to pass it as anything like entertainment. seriously! The film revolves around an island where only men are to breed, but I prefer to stay on Gilligan Island with pictures of Condoleezza Rice only, and then I find myself stuck there. <br /> <br /> The funniest part about this was the guy who hit the farthest fart I heard about in the cinema. This is neither a joke nor a fantasy. I have never been in the movie "Thrill" and I heard a lot of laughter by going out of the entire movie. I can not tell you for sure if laughter is intentional in some efforts to relieve movie tension or if they really believe that this crude will actually fly. I found myself frankly heading towards power outages or maybe a fight in the movie theater, nothing to make this more interesting which is very sad since Deez and Powder were bombed two beer before the little movie of the anesthesia mentality (soon to be legal before all the movies Nic Cage, type to your congressman today, do not be late). At some point, did I actually think that this film is a parody and that Anna Ferris will appear? What a wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage poses a lot of pork in the frame that I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. To believe that I thought Sean Penn was d * ck because of his criticism of Nic, I'm still less than one? Yes Sean Penn's d * ck has been reduced due to this movie. Are we all handsome playing Nick your strength and adhering to being a pathetic loser and a drunkard. You can not play Superman you do not get to play huge strong roles go directly to the prison do not pass do not go pool $ 200. His best moments in this film are when he finally comes out and separates from a murderous woman to steal the bears suit (like a fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) and then continue running in Amok like Conan O'Brien's masturbation bear, but with half the joy of the bear knocking the junk around him . Fortunately, it came to an end shortly after it turned out that it would be a sacrifice to the fans at the new hybrid show tour of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes really!!!! Have you just messed up the end for you? If you know anything better, you will build statues of me in worship and singing legendary songs. I sat in this amazing festival so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> Almost in the middle of this meager project I kept thinking, Jack Bauer concluded this case within 20 minutes of actual time. . 35 minutes if Kim is attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have discovered this in less than an hour? And you, sir, are not the inspectors of Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If you have been captured and for some reason, you can watch this movie or take a bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
