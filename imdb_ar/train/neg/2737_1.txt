There are no vandals in this review. There is nothing to spoil it. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy or anything; most sections try, at least, to link sections of the plot with some weak extensions, but this has not. Clips, three lines lead to the next endless sequence of boring passages ... well, so it may have been short at the time of production, but it is better to skip this episode altogether. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how to achieve this, in fact. The commentators are usually much better at sabotaging the awards, but somehow it happened .... <br /> <br /> We thank the heavens who returned to the model by the next episode.
