Whew. What can be said about Gymkata that has not already done? This is only pure halarity from start to finish. If you want to get a movie that would keep you laughing on the ground, this is the perfect movie to get it. From the burry / wild-style parrot sweater to Pakistan (and four billion different ninja), everything about this film shimmers from crap. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Claus, the infamous mind who brought you the mirror scene in the death game Bruce Lee, again presents his complete lack of direct talent. Some other faces you will probably not recognize will also appear, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you will not remember or care about them after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be based on a book called The Terrible Game, which if you find a single impact anywhere in the world will be interested in reading it, to see where this error occurred. Instead, the book seems to be a pattern of the imagination of Gymkata. There is probably something Clouse has made to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this and dream it yourself. It's one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's very few.
