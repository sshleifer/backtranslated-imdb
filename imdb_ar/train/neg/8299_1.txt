The Christmas story is a classic holiday and my favorite film. Of course, I was thrilled when this film came out in 1994. I saw it on opening day and was ready to enjoy myself. I came away Thornt and Digusted. The expectation that Rang is true in the Christmas story is mysteriously missing from this mess. It's better to get BB BB Ryder BB than the best Chinese, which is not funny at all. Charles Groden is good but the buck stops there. Bottom line: 1 star. Do not care.
