After waiting impatiently to the end, I would say that I wish I had not joined the whole chain in the first place. The last episode was all against the previous seven years. Everything has been destroyed. The trip was 23 years old, but Captain Janway has the ability to trim it ... to move, just seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crew were dying throughout the flight. Why do you want to save seven out of just nine? Others do not count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew says that going home is not really the most important thing for them. As he says, "The journey is more important than the destination." unbelievable. In the final scene, their other Union ships are surrounded by the earth in sight. Nothing is about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst ends at all.
