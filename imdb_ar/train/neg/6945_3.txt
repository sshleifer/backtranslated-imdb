Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his daughter and his wife was violently attacked in an invasion of the house. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through stress. Archer finds himself in front of a man, Til Schweiger, who is tied in a chair. He was told that this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and can do whatever he likes. There is a large set of tools out there to help him ... <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting at first (and shows a real stress regarding blood and germ) but it becomes more stupid in the minute and has some great possibilities for shifts and plot turns. All of this ends in a final development that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that anyone was already thinking of using it anymore. How talented actors such as Eldard, Schweiger, and Blumer were involved in such nonsense. This gets three stars for acting but the stupid plot and the incredible changes really make this work a must.
