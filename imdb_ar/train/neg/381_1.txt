This film is a traditional Bollywood fare as much as the power of a star, passion and a triangle of love emotions. What really bothered me about this film is a silly idea for the mother of the alternative mother maker. A prostitute conceives a child with someone having sex with a man (from a family that wants a child) is not an alternative mother. Nor is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have watched Indian movies and television programs from 10 to 15 years ago and dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and unreasonable at all. I realize that most Bollywood films are not meant to be reasonable, but they do not pretend to be. This film wants us to grow alongside characters, but this can not be done in such a turbulent and turbulent conflict. I was expecting better than Abbas and Mesut.
