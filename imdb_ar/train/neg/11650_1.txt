After coming out of the first one you think that wayans brothers can come up with some new jokes. Although I do not think so. If the first is not bad enough, it is very bad, which hurts us to see it. With all the actors who participated in this film, you think they can come up with something smarter. Although they could not, they had to take the same ridiculous and ridiculous jokes from the first newsletter and put them one way or another in this film believing that people would laugh again. Although the thing I did not laugh about it for the first time. They tried to turn these films into a parody even though they failed at every level. Most of the time, jokes are only entered randomly, which is disgusting and glamorous so that it is difficult to see and enjoy. Then when they try to do scenes that represent a parody of the films, they end up in a scene break for 20 minutes with perhaps one joke within the entire scene. Also for people who say this is not an older and real audience, I agree with the age group that is supposed to be funny. While people say different people have different ideas about what's funny or not, if you find this funny, you're probably not the most mature or smart person. It does not take much writing to write this type of script, although if you want a smarter and more entertaining movie, watch Spaceballs. It's a parody of a really good movie and I did well and I did not have to use disgusting and ugly jokes to make it funny as well.
