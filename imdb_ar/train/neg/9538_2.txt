When I saw the ad for this, I was all about seeing it. Now, forgive me, but it has been a long time since I saw him, I do not remember how things went. Suffice it to say that the film I saw does not look like the "movie" I was using. <br /> <br /> I felt incredibly bored, annoyed and disappointed by this film. If it was not bad enough, they had to drown it even more with reggae music. Not exactly mood music to put a horror film, eh Moon? I think if you do not see the ad (or trailer, I think), you might think this is some hot stuff. For my money, advertising was better.
