I had high expectations after "My Beautiful Laundries" and "Bend It Like Beckham" and "Less East" "East is East". The history of British Asians suited to their adopted home has had many good performances on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent television and radio series (Goodness, etc.). This one falls. Despite the good start, it soon faded away. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was a shocking and typical effort for the BBC, complemented by strong regional dialects, overly misleading characters, "Those Were Those Days," and a lot of "issues" trying to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself dealing with many points during this film. Writing is predictable. Each possible cliche was pulled and broadcast. In fact, I have a problem thinking about any multicultural / multigenerational devices that could otherwise be used. The characters were thin and vulgar; the oddly uncommon minister; good meaning but eventually an old racist woman; overweight, arrogant aunt. Pushy Indian parents. Running the working class; Grandmother deep "wise"; riding motorcycle bullying. The scenario was weak, with every opportunity to shock the audience with a public racist dialogue of two racist white characters taken. And why it had to be put in the seventies (regardless of the need for an excuse for soundtrack music in the seventies) is a mystery. Perhaps the unreasonable figures make the ratification of people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even if we put these things aside, good behavior could lead to decent ambiguity. Instead, the usual suspects in BBC Comedy were kicked out for his removal. "Bend It Like Beckham" had a far better playful (and serious representation) than this, with almost unknown actors. <br /> <br /> In short, a lazy cliche, disposed of, boringly a predictable story. Give it a miss. <br /> <br />
