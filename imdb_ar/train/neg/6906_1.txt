This film is not limited to a bad plot, a bad trend and a terrible representation, but opens up a completely new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this film, "white" chicks are sluts, "white" boys are the gangsters who want to be, and successful (yes again) "white" entrepreneurs revolve around toilet-makers. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering what would happen if I made the same movie with exactly the same line of story and script, I just made about the Caucasians. "It's a man, it's good to finally see that you've stopped dating those black chicks." <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice, but watch this movie again and will vomit from how they filmed the new film. New Zealand "white boys". Suddenly her white people who are the main cause of gang aggression, and prostitutes out of the rapid explosion. Only Samoan girls are the ones who have a heart, and there is no so-called white non-whore girl. <br /> <br /> It is disgusting that they could not produce this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a disgusting picture. If you think I'm going public, go watch this movie, and watch what you make of White Boys. Just because the Samoan choose to call us "white boys" in real life, does not mean funny. If I say, Black boy, I will lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
