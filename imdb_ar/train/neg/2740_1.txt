I still do not know why I forced myself to sit in everything. This "movie" was not worth Memorex DVD-R burned; I thought I was watching the final result of a group of middle school students stealing their parents' camera. This is by far the worst film ever. I really, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for two hours that he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it's supposed to be deliberately bad; however, if you should end up in hell and have to watch this 90-minute file from doo-doo, you'll see that Yamasato tries Really make a great effort to make a wonderful click. The actors try to make exciting performances in a jogging kick similar to Crimson Tide but approach the Marine. <br /> <br /> The stunning representation is just the tip of the iceberg. Camera angles are awful. The story is a C movie at best - the plot is not good enough to be considered a B-film caliber. Dialogue tries to be dynamic and brilliant, but it is as pure as everything else. Rumors say the printed version of the scenario is already attracting flies. In addition, the technical result is annoying ... not because it is technical, but because it is not parked. True, the background music is playing THE WHOLE TIME, acting as a tentative reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what purported disclaimer, do not buy. BOTS did not make this a bad thing on purpose, because it takes itself very seriously for what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very low in budget. But this is not an excuse for the absorption factor in the development of records. Great films were born out of content, not budget. BOTS did not have any of these. From the appearance of the samurai, I'll be out of the game faster than Steven Seagal's executive decision. <br /> <br /> Without doubt, some people will try to defend the film. Two, maybe three. They will say, "It's a grindhouse stamping sock!" Or "cheesy in a good way!" Or "That's too bad, it's good!" These people are stupid. The film is good or bad. There is nothing like a bad bad movie. But there are things like idiots who love crappy movies. Do not get me wrong. There are a lot of corn movies that should not be taken seriously and are fun and entertaining. One slipped. BOTS are not. <br /> <br /> This fate lasts about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it takes 90 minutes. The best feature of this movie is the DVD cover, so the next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD, look at it - do not touch it, just look - and walk quietly.
