Iberia is lovely to see on TV. But why do you see this in the silver screen? Lots of dance and music. If you love classical music or modern dance, this may be your history. But otherwise an hour and a half only a very long time. If you want to see skilful dancing in the silver screen, it is best to see a Bollywood movie. They know how to combine taking a breath and dancing to a long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot through the old experience. And from time to time looks good. But when the film is an hour and an hour, it should be fun at least. There are many works of art, not everything bigger than life, this film is not too big.
