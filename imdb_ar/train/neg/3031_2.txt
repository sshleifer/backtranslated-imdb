Tony Scott destroys anything that may be exciting in Richard Kelly's vulgar and brilliant scenarios. Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley) was a model who left school and became a good fisherman. This is her story ... "kind of". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not much of the story at all and that Scott's intense design style for each shot acts as a remote mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays her role as an evil avenger who has done nothing to justify our respect. She pierces people she dislikes and gives up her clothes when she needs to, but she is not the least realistic and Farsley is not the least persuasive. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It is also high, and it is bound by one of the most troublesome sources of music I have heard in a long time. The last 20 minutes is a poor replay of Scott's "real romance" peak, where the Domino gang will meet two sets of bad guys - a surprise! Surprise! - Designed to shoot with each other at the top of Las Vegas Casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this frustrating disagreement is completely thwarted by Scott and becomes a confusing and meaningless exercise in the celluloid masturbation. This is not a courageous or experimental piece of art; it fails at every level because it gives us no access to the life and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rarkey seems to be a good hunter, but disappears in the background because he "narrates" progress. Chris and Alan turn into another awkward veil, and Dabni Coleman, always solid, under-utilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the surface of this multilayered movie, which is full of motion. It is still strange no matter how hard it is to polish it.
