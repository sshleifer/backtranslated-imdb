I used to love this movie as a child, but after seeing it again 20 years later, I really suck it. Up The Academy may have advanced back to 1980, but has nothing to offer today! Films such as Caddyshack and Stripes today retain much better than this wonderful game. Not T & A. There are no great jokes except the individual lines we have all heard a million times so far. <br /> <br /> I recently purchased the DVD in the hope that it will be his ticket. Well, I've been away! The soundtrack was only 3 to 2 of the widely known songs (not the smashing set mentioned by others) and the vocal sounds were repetitive and awesome. The only thing that was interesting for me was to predict what the lines of character were before they said it. Yes, I watched this movie a lot at that time! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give my year about why I forgot this film, sorry to say. :(
