Although the impressive ginger man crew collapses early and often. The plot is unrealistically wrapped, sporting actors bad accents and co-director Robert Altman sums up the check collection. Once again, he assembled influential actors (such as Woody Allen, everyone who wanted to work with Altman), which this time was not true. But this is only part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a strong Georgian lawyer working in the heavy opening scenes of the film, to convince himself of the temptation by a waitress to provide a mysterious food that convinced him she was in serious danger from a previous husband and a morbid father. With red flags everywhere, the smart lawyer screams so he can get his children in harms. The gun and gun battles continue with the chase of the required cars, and if that is not enough, there is a hurricane that was put in the ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays with MacGruder in a simple and unconvincing southern accent. He ran in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he blinded to what is evident in order to keep the story going. Bob Downey Jr. is very bad like P.I. But with a little more focus on the bad tone. Robert Duval as an elderly man is Bo Radelli, grew up in a craze over a bed bug that serves thick slices of pork but at least his reasonable language. Lead females (Embeth Davids, Hannah Daryl, Jansen Famkhee) are lean legs and immobile. Even the famous lawyers who made the veil (Vernon Jordan) enjoy wood with a few lines that they throw. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying little attention to his actors, the scene of Altman in the scene, which is dripping with mysterious Spanish algae, is a scene of comic play. He lacks touches and anomalies (he tells the viewer that the stars and bars are still waving in Georgia) making Altman very unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man Altman is at its worst, even if the pay is the same.
