This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it only takes an hour and a half, it feels somewhere near 4. I have never seen a movie moving very slowly and without purpose. This is also a horror film that happens a lot of time during the day. My friend and I laughed a huge amount of times when we were supposed to be scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a movie has been shown in many countries. Can not be high in demand. <br /> <br /> Nicole Betty should stick to the bar because, although beautiful, she has lost her accent many times in this film, half the time is British and half the time is American.
