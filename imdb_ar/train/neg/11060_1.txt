It would have been a wonderful look at the life of one of America's most famous armed killers, but unfortunately this did not come close. Terrible editing, direction, bad representation, you name it. This film is literally about 10 minutes from the plot stretched to 100. The only replacement quality is Bruce Davidson as a father, but this is hardly enough to keep this stinky. 1 out of 10.
