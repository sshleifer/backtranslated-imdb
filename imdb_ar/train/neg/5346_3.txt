I had to watch this movie because the plot was very heinous and the movie lived up to expectations. In fact, it makes the display very inconvenient at times. Unlike other Mayer films, alien sex decreased to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unjustified and humiliating. The plot is chaotic and some representation and lines are appalling. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange mix of Sadu Mazushi fantasy along with a brutal window and corruption of slavery and failure in all respects. It seems as if Meyer was trying to compensate for sexual exploitation / exploitation by getting a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel guilty about getting involved in the scandalous Dominatrix signs in the early scene that show that Mrs. Susan is stuck with a whip in a provocative group. Then tries to return to the good path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good on evil. However, because they are canceling each other, you end up with nothing. <br /> <br /> Since it is very bad in many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a bad film at worst. Taste possible. Perhaps, because it is very bad, we have left Meyer to escape the unacceptable.
