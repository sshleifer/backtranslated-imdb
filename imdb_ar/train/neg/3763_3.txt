A group of forest guards and scientists are going to the woods to find fossils. They stumble upon Bigfoot's buried land at the end (they did not notice it in the dark), the Bigfoot CGI scenes are appalling, but better than the endless scenes of talk they rarely intersect. I used to think there might be a good bigfoot movie being produced. But now, after so many sad sad movies about the myth, I have serious doubts. In order to pour salt in the wound watching this film, the girl with a good appearance will not be upset once. Although this film may be better than "Boggy Creek 2", it is still sad that the best non-documentary about Bigfoot remains "Harry and the Henriksons" <br /> <br /> My appreciation:
