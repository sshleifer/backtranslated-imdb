If there is one film that is worse this year - Tashan gave the first promo a signal that the film would be a boring Dhoom 2 film, and I know first that it would be a bad film no matter what it is because it's a Yashraj movie or maybe I'm watching the promotional show but this The film gave me a shock, but it was the worst after Dhoom 2 and what I expected from the introduction of the first Saif boring then meets Saif-Kareena, Kareena very artificial then Anil Kapoor Oh God, what does he do in a strange film? What kinda role is it? What does he do? His first scene was fine, but then he did it again and then Akshay came in. He made some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the obsolete childhood romance things, an overdose of movement scenes like childish Rajnikan and all the boring scenes The end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya will get 3 more movies to direct her, if this movie succeeds, this is a yashraj strategy, money is just nothing else, so Vijay is another addition to the filmmakers' list of music crap (Vishal Shekhar) Normal <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar's performances come in the film as a smell of the Fresh air, it actually provides some of the attractive moments that Saif Ali Khan is angry, Karina is very bad outrageous and spoils the exhibition more comfortable is fine
