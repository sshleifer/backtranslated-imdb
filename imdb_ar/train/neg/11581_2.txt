This is a really wonderful movie. The plot (as it is) is completely undeliverable. (I think it's blackmail, but I'm not quite sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches. The other half is spoken by various actors in such an incomprehensible tradition of "southern" dialects which (fortunately) can not recognize the words. <br /> <br /> But the real tragedy of the film is that such historical talent is because Mary Tyler Moore seemed to be in financial or personal circumstances. <br /> <br />
