In short, this film has no value at all. <br /> <br /> The idea is to produce a film from the point of view of what someone might think from the early 20th century in the future. It is an interesting idea, but the absence of a compelling story or characters prevents us from commenting on our disbelief, so the idea flips. <br /> <br /> It looks like the entire movie has been cast with green screens and we are supposed to be a fan. But as a graphics person, the excessive softening was a clear crutch to hide the difficult hard edge problem with the green check. The color is washed heavily without any related effect except to reduce image quality. I do not understand why anyone considers that anything that is being shown in this film is by no means a pioneer. If anything, retro graphics have reduced ridiculous stripes to very bad graphics - they do not live up to the old Jurassic Park graphics. Robot models were very simple, clear and not very convincing. There was a group of eccentric animals on that island, but they were not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is awesome beyond imagination. In fact I can not believe I did not get out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unpaid, and is based throughout the film to mistrust and deception. Why is Maurice Bailey's character even there? We are not convinced in any way that a heroic atmosphere - I mean that he flies in an airplane, and saved one person (Poli) for personal reasons. Yes there is a great champion for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why should we care about Joe who wants to save him? Who was the Nepalese who closed Joe and Polly in the mine, and why did they do that (remember that the entire Tutankov process was robotic)? <br /> <br /> Punctures of the plot: (1) Why did the figure of Bai Ling (a great fall of her excellent character in the "crow") stop the robots that captured the atmosphere? They were looking for a bottle, and they did not find it. (2) Why Dicks is caught in hell but does not kill (he does not have or knows about flasks, and the bad guys do not know that Polly had flasks and was connected to the atmosphere and therefore to Dex)? (3) Poly indicates that "they" know nothing about Totenkopf, but has some secret sources about him that contain what appears to be a FBI-style file. (4) an empty spot on the map as described by Nepalese - if they know all about this mysterious area, then why the hell is their map empty at that spot? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - a new atmosphere of clothing similar to his old clothes is given, yet Polly has to wear huge, bulky clothes, and in the same continuum, Suddenly her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. To what extent should I change my mind to see these wastes? <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be delightful with excessively produced music, even when nothing dramatic or exciting is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> Representation? Are we supposed to be impressed by a bunch of bad British dialects? Any character is not annoying? I think the Ling Bai dialogue may have been the best in the entire film (it does not have a single line). The dialogue was not a camp, nor did it rise to the level of cowardice. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or convincing. They are the kind of people you will try to ignore or not associate with if you feel bad to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie gets a higher rating than the average here they sang. IMHO should be competing with "Batman Forever" at the bottom 100 of all time.
