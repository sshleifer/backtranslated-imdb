Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to the high back. Now this is a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this role is Don Knots. First, as one of them pointed out, Sinatra does not have the structure that a bad Western man wants. It is just "slight" at this stage of his life. Maybe it was about the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy has a very strong structure. Sinatra shows up as a little girl talking and no one should take her seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is neither inspirational nor truly credible. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the end and how the city dwellers react in this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be "abusive". This is just a small town, so I do not get attractive and do not understand why people will be allowed to control this way. <br /> <br /> There is an "interest in love" in the story and if I followed it right, I was upset when the main character refused to admit what it was so as not to kill another bad person. Now there is true love for you. Stand by yourself! Tell him your name until he kills you! Haha. Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried this story, it had no logical course to follow except in the trash. Want to know why they are not shown on your video and never show on your TV? Critics seemed to criticize him in 1956 and were right - this film is very bad. I almost bet that Sinatra would pay someone to six times as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a western well where a town stands against a bad man? Try Tension at Table Rock, or at Gunpoint - two truly Westerners, with this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stenko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you did not belong to a movie like that.
