I can only believe that Kanon Garrison must have two people. Who wrote "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote excellent scenarios such as "Adam's Rib", "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the person who wrote and / or directed this sad sad move like " , "Kind of nut", that is. The cast tries, but the script is tired and the clich√© so that Brenda Vaccaro's brilliant efforts have always been defeated. The script drowns rarely in the truly offensive sequence in which Jensen's personality tests Davidas' character to make sure he is not gay. The sequence is ugly, but unfortunately can easily play in today's film. "Ethnic" jokes have become quite common, but "nagging" jokes are still "fun, clean and fun for the family."
