From the moment the film begins, there is already a difference. Since this film is on the border of Normandy and the Middle East, and also as an international film, one expects to paint the appropriate dialects. This is not done because the majority of American cast votes. Also, I find that acting is trained at best, the line of story is difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise the film is very delicate in fashion and landscape. If you want to watch a movie to find out what it was in the past (although there are no accents) this movie is worth the rent. If you're looking for an epic movie like Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
