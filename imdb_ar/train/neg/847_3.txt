The film revolves around two brothers who are supposed to be similar - but do not expect to be smart - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write the computer code. Geniuses also like to call themselves very exaggerated voices if compared to personal characteristics, can you imagine the title material. <br /> <br /> I honestly did not like the style of the film. I think the anxiety, the confusion and the deep blues he brings there for some purpose, but what I did not get is why there is so much of it. The film is cheap on the viewer and tells the story basically without any human aspect. He gives a comic book like experience. Although it visually closes the viewer, it somehow brings it into the blues through short dialogs, monotonous scenes, dynamic pieces, music and sudden noise. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is very simple, and most of what is going on is being filmed dramatically for long minutes, mostly in a confusing delirium that simulates the effects of drug abuse and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will say frankly that this film did not agree with my small exclusions.
