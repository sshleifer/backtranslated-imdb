Tobe Hooper has manufactured great films so you are sure that this can not be bad. I have not read any reviews and have tried to watch this humorous film unintentionally. Sometimes this makes me laugh, sometimes I'm almost asleep, and sometimes I make me cry over the movie "Hopper" dramatically. <br /> <br /> I rated this level 3/10 because of the horror movie that happened in 1990 and many exciting or funny things happened there. Throughout the film I was thinking of something like "They simply can not add more things to this movie ..." But they did. <br /> <br /> Some say this is a sort of Firestarter clone but really it's not. It's based on this idea but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, exotic things in religion / God, funny heirs, minor effects, drama, terrible acting, incredible scenario ... and more. <br /> <br /> * The spoilers * The story is: the government is trying to create a final weapon using nuclear power or something and fails, during the process of giving birth to 2 people test. When a mother sings for her child after birth, both husband and wife are burned, which is comfortable. The government buries everything and leaves this child living among other people ... Ten years later this child grows up and realizes that he has been born for some reason and who can burn things with his brains. Then everything goes incredibly messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well when the government realizes "Well now that he can set fire to this work" they take him to the normal hospital where some toxic nuclear will use it on this guy because they can kill him , They can not shoot him! .. and Arg, I think that's enough to tell me, I promise you that there is 100 odd things in this film. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want good laughs watch this movie. My God.
