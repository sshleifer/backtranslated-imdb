This film can be judged from three perspectives: as history, as a personal profile of a faithful, as a fictional film. <br /> <br /> He failed as history, recalling in passing the coup d'etat that expelled Obote, expelled the Asians, and his Entebbe Hi Jack as a background, but not in any time-consistent time frame. <br /> <br /> As a profile for Amin, it may be interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this is a better film, he gets an Oscar. (He got it - proving that Oscar voters do not watch the movies they vote on). He ignores the relevant historical events in the novel, which the Secretary and history of Uganda noted from the doctor's point of view. Instead, she tells the fictional story of the Scottish doctor and his life impossible from Amin's point of view. But the story that is recounted is the only incident in which Amin may be innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no conspiracy to bring them together. The beginning is tight - it takes cinematic freedoms with the novel, but it sets the story. The doctor's character is well defined, but it is lost in the second half of the film that suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Why does a doctor explain why he stays in Kampala badly? Why does not a stranger approve? I lost my friend's character in the novel because the Scottish has an affair rather than a black doctor - an ironic tangle that does not seem so believable but allows the film's author to show a faithful fury at hand. The man called the horse bit in the end is not capable of. <br /> <br /> Finally in 1971, Uganda was on the left, not on the right, and the number plates were three letters, two or three digits - and where were the equator's fangs ?! <br /> <br /> In short - if you have not heard of Ameen before, you might want to spend two hours viewing this movie to appreciate Forrest Whitaker, but the last hour will be confusing. If you know Uganda or read the book - you do not see the movie - it will only frustrate you. And if you want to know why the doctor was too reckless - it is not.
