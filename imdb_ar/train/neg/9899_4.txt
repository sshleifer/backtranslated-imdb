The film version is necessarily silly literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ehab, who is in love with the daughter of Rev. Juan Joan. His brother Derek is a rival to Mrs. Bennett. When Mr. Barrymore lost his leg in a whaling incident, Bennett refused. He must slay the whale and win Bennett's return ... <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that may have impressed the 1930 theater audience especially the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg. The film has not advanced in age, there are films much better than that time, whether silent in the twenties of the twentieth century and the talks of the thirties. The best attractions are John Barrymore and Joan Bennett. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon - John Barrymore, Joanne Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
