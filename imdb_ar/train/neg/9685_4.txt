I do not know about you, but I always felt attracted to the cinema "ART". The first film "Technician" managed to get it was "Peter, the Thief, His Wife and Her Beloved" by Peter Greenaway, who blew my mind and fingerprinted the creative dimensions. The film was the final paradox, be it beautiful or ugly ... This is what revolves around "artistic cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and presenting the visceral to the screen with purpose. Life and real life can be like living in a crazy house, and art shows what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but especially those that enjoy them and believe in them, whether you agree with the position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 woman", dry, 'comedy' Where the father and son gather to create their own sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief reference to Philini in the film, contrary to what the reviews suggested. The main focus of the film is on the "close" relationship between the father and the son, which was collected after the death of the mothers. In the early scenes of the film, Fathers grieve, and you can feel his pain. What happens next is clearly defined by the Greenway standards, the collection of harem, the notes about love and death, and the meat offered for meat ... One might argue this, but I feel that the film is shallow and futile. The idea that this can be a comedy is puzzling to me. Most of them behave if they are good, especially especially Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though poor Mandy should wear her clothes). What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual groeneaway touches from the surplus that other movies have made to watch. <br /> <br /> While filled with moments of insight, and occasional taboos, "8 1/2 women" are cut and pasted so that they can not be considered art, but so nice to the point that it is "funny" and simply too boring to be worthy Pay attention. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
