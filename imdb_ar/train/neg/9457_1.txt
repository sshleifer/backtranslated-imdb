Everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. It has reached the point where I realized that his rapid return had not changed since the days of SNL, more than a decade ago. It is the same pleasant jokes to stream consciousness and the same voices. His cat is painless. Trying the way to hard. It's a weird kind comedy, not the cold cat that's supposed to be. The rest of the film is just as bad. The groups are incredibly ugly --- obviously a waste of millions of dollars. (The cardboard scraps of the backyard were more logical than building a whole neighborhood and a main street.) Alec Balwin is trying to give a great impression of Santini, but he ends up searching and seems incoherent. There is even a moment of cheesecake with celebrity Paris Hilton Paris --- which revolves in their minds simply because this is supposed to be the story of Dr. Suss. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they will make Horton Hernes who is with Robin Williams and then we will get a three-seos film from the Sioux Championship).
