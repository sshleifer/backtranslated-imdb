Why this title? Santa Clause??? Very nice and unpredictable. Before that I tried to take advantage of the spirit of the holiday, most notably "Santa Claus defeats Mars", at least it was fun to watch because of its wars, and all stock footage used ... for some reason, that looked happy to me. But this movie just Christmas pins in the butt, nails all the joy of children. Santa lives in space? His enemy is the devil named pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin the magician? How random is this !? Well, since it was produced in Mexico, some of you may understand how the film is made. I had to admit that some of the effects were only foolish at the time. I've had a comprehensive range of madness! Although, despite all the movie problems, it still looks like a Christmas movie. Goodness triumphs over evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts from every good girl or boy in the world, or maybe a kona, thanks to Santa Claus conquering Mars .. it seems. So, I think you should try it out, even if it is one of the worst holiday films ever ... although it should put a smile on your face any day.
