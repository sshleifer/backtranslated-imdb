The Annie wig does not look good. It's not nice and nice enough to play Annie. Annie sticks to the film, where her clothes look like Halloween costumes. The terrible plot and terrible plots. This film is such a change from the 1982 version. I think the younger and younger girl should have had a leading role. Ashley Johnson portrays Annie very childish. Not attractive at all. At least the director got the right thing with Daddy Warbucks. Ms. Hannigan was also Misscast. Camilla Belle played Molly Okay. "WARNING" This movie may insult your IQ so you may just want to introduce it to very young children. 8 and smaller. Some plots are very fanciful and can barely occur in the real world.
