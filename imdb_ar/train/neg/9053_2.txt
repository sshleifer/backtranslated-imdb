Simply put, I found a TV show "Mash" vulgar, preaching, oh ever "politically correct", repeated, and grumpy, the biggest sin ever, that is,? It was unbelievably boring. You have Alan Alda as the main leader, "(star)", who adores himself with his intelligence, which made me really uncomfortable even to try to sit in a loop. The original series contains both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, who will happily admit that they had some of the elegance and style to present their characters. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, Mike Farrell, both individually and composite alike, is similar to eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Soet, who found her boring, without any fault on her part, was curious to look at, and Gary Borgoff, who was good in the film, was tired of appearance and acting while wearing it. Seeing one show a year showed it to me. Jimmy Far was a "comedy" with low eyebrows and not even worth mentioning here at all. The reason I have not given it a rating (one), which anyone wonders about now, is that classifications of any kind are not just a self-call, but rather a relative call. TV, with relatively few exceptions, is such a rough. In relative terms, Mash had some quality production (according to TV standards) in that era and today, and therefore it deserves two. Rob Ritter
