What piece of trash was this film. The premise was fine, but even at first with crappy effects to blend with a giant with ordinary people (so the effects in Hercules was better) I knew this would be bad. But the really horrific part of the film is the dialogues. It's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. I felt like it was written by some ninth graders in the creative class and I got a D-certificate. I want to applaud Casper van Diem and other actors to follow this film. <br /> <br /> I got my share of bad movies and cheese (I love series of shakes), but this ... I would not recommend it at all. It's silly and the boxes are quite bad and flabbergastingly will make you cringe.
