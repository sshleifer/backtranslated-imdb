I really wanted to like this movie - the footage was filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photos. But, even for the animation that was filmed, it was a really bad film. Both continuity and speed were simply awful. The best bits in the movie are within the limits of the final balances, so (almost) worth sticking to until the end (though oddly, they pick up a bit during the past half hour or so). <br /> <br /> When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know that there must be a problem ...
