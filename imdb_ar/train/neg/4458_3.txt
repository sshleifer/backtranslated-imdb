Most of the French films I saw - and enjoyed - were more of a word than work, but that's good. I found them interested and well photographed and with interesting representatives. (However, I was amazed at some point if Gerald DePardeau in every French film ever! <br /> <br /> This movie has the same interesting imagery and has a good opening. But then talk, talk and more talk ... is good for drama but not for the mystery of murder. After a moment, I was watching quite sleep. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie was like a game with all the scenes that were shown in almost one room. So, if you like plays, you should love this ... but I want more fuss for a story that has been killed.
