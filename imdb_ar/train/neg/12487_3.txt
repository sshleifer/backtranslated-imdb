This film was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I took the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of material that does not reach the level of actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) simply do not reach the level of materials. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were bigger than Davis and Kenny, and look at what happened in one night - classic at all. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent in comedy (the good thing for her is that it's only the only comedy she ever tried!) Davis's one-note performance melts in praise, but none of the differences Minute in Colbert's representation in a one-night event. Kani, who was a great comedy actor, appeared to be out of sync with Davis. The text provides some fine lines and accents, but delivery seems more appropriate for drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which seems like making Davis and Kani more suited to a light drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who has played similar roles throughout his career, has dealt with very similar materials. In a fairly typical supporting role, Eugene Pallet offers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old western influence, Harry Davenport, very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is very annoying. The constant references to his character to the fictional police are a weak effort in the paradox. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists, and it's a shame that they, as a whole, did not achieve more chemistry and not a better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
