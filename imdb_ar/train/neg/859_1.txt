This stinking bomb recently caught a cable TV and reminded me of the awful extent I thought it was in 1980 when it was first released. Many reviewers are not old enough to remember the huge uproar surrounding this film and the conflict between Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King. The hugely popular novel included hordes of fans who wanted to see the director of a supposed "master" putting this supernatural story on the screen. Lot Salem was already destroyed in the late 1970s as a mini-television series, directed by Toby Hooper (a famous Texas Shainsu Massacre) and badly dealt with, turning the main villain in the book into a "vampire theater" with " There is no real threat at all and the whole hypothesis is destroyed, and the fans hope that the director of Cobrick's position will succeed where Hubert has failed. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this film looks great and has a wonderful opening sequence, but after these few achievements , Jack Nicholson can not be anything but Jack Nicholson, who is always crazy and has offered nothing for his role here. I'm interested that many reviewers here think it's all in this clinker, "Here's Johnny!" Despite the thing ... It's so bad in this film, so it's everybody else, for that matter. Dick Skolan Brothers, Dick Halperan, was necessary for the plot of the book, but Kubrick kills him in one of the most shocking "Shock" series on the film. Many left. In fact, King's books do not translate well into a film because many narratives occur internally to his characters, often metaphysical. Kubrick abandoned the tension between the living and the dead for the sake of elegance here and the resulting chaos ends so far away from the original material that we do not really care what happens to whom. <br /> <br /> This movie still stinks and why many believe it is a horror masterpiece is beyond me.
