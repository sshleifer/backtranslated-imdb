The film was a major box office failure in 1957. It was based on a novel later turned into a Broadway play. The story revolves around some naval officers on vacation in San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4-day leave at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film lags a lot and does not seem to be very real. Cary Grant is generally proficient in comedy and drama - but here he plays the role of a wheeler and he does not really pull it. Tony Curtis or James Garner had better options. Audrey Hepburn was initially appointed to play in front of Grant, but had other commitments - so Susie Parker intervened. She did not act before, but she was the best casual photo in America at the time. I think it has done a good job, taking into account all the pressures it has been subjected to. The association between Grant and Jane Mansfield did not succeed in brief brief scenes. The studio was trying to give her some lessons by working with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
