What a lost waste. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert does not let me down, but I feel cheated after seeing this film. <br /> <br /> The only excitement is seeing Elizabeth Banks in her bra. This is a sorry statement about this film. It was a harbinger of many promises, but it was like the dry flattery of a transgender. <br /> <br /> This is a self-contained journey. <br /> <br /> I can not express enough traffic for Marari while sitting in this movie and I hope to warn you of the same frustration.
