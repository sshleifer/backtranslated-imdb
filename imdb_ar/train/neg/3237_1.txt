It's not because I feel happy when I see a real bloody spill, but when I put a DVD in a bloodbath, and what I get is one bloody scene at the end of the fake tail, and a chair jump, I ended up thinking, 43 minutes of my life have lasted forever. " I will not take this as a "flower" flesh and blood "movies" as much as is the exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. The flower of flesh and blood had some hard points to watch. Satan did not experience. It was at best, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectations were too high. I put the DVD in thinking "Hey man, this will get sick." After seeing them slapping the girl about a thousand times, I was watching her fast ahead. <br /> <br /> There are two types of people interested in this film. 1) People looking for F'd up movies just to see how terrified, or 2) horror is complete. I have sought this and other guinea pig movies for the latter reason, but even if you fall into the first category, this movie will not float on my boat. In fact, I can imagine that this film increases the lust of his blood ... as in "Will B * TCH really be killed !!" In conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for compilation purposes. If you want a massacre that is not provided by traditional horror, get the "traces of death". Sure, this is also absorbed, but at least you'll get the blood and courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I see anyone praising this nonsense is that they feel they are supposed to do so. No technical merit I can understand, there is no reason to bad reputation, nothing. Just try lame to be shocked.
