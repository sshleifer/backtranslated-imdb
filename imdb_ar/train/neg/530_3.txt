I saw this in the infiltration two days before the official opening, I must say I was very disappointed. I must put the majority of these problems in the decision to throw Claire Denmark in the lead role. As you think of the Danes, she was either terribly misguided, or so far away from her head that she must be the first candidate in Razzie's 2007 worst actress. I think we were supposed to sympathize with her. Instead, it is completely unpopular. Other great actresses perform well, but certainly do not light the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this film, I say that the person who did the best job is Natasha Richardson. It is barely in the picture, and only appears near the end. <br /> <br /> An awesome scenario too. They bear fruit in the form of reading lines rather than being "personal".
