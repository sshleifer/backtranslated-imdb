I am 47 years old and spent most of my life in my life as I remember, a fan of horror films and science fiction. Whether they are silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them I can not find something they like. However, I will give this film credit for the good and created influences but that's it. This is the case of the effects on the story. The truth is that we live at a time when there are few films left that we have not seen in a horror film. So you must have a good original story for a movie of any kind for entertainment. A good story can overcome bad influences and bad representation, but the bad story with good influence and good effects is still a bad film. This movie does not even have a good representation, but only good effects. So unless you can just about Gore, pass this one.
