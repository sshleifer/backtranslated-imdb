The film is fairly good, but it is not a true story. <br /> <br /> Robin was a "tycoon" who was a liar and known for killing, and was never convicted. New Jersey just did not go for this third time in 20 years. Carter got a show in 1976: "Pass the lie test and go for free". He did not take it. This movie should never be, but money talks. Many people have spent their lives unjustly in prison, and the number of blacks is more than white. Why Choose a Fake Story? <br /> <br /> Jens
