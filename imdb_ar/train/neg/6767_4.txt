I can sit through this film once, but I doubt that I have produced it for the second time. It is mildly amusing about the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (think of something about Mary), the emergence of a new actor more serious Mikel Keaton. This is not the fun of the "bug of love" but it was fun. One of my most critical criticisms of the film was the fact that Herbie evolved into an exotic R2D2 mostly. I was bored by the effects of the eyes of the lamp the second time in the 30 or so times it was used and the cause of the forward curve in the same response. Go see this with your little kids, no kids "one chip" and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
