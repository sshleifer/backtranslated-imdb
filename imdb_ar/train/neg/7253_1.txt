We rented a DVD for West Germany well. The movie was beautiful and the sights reasonable, but the ideas were very poor. Here are my problems in the film. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the bad man kill the mine owner? He was really connected to the film only to prove how bad he was and had a hideout. <br /> <br /> The bank employee has misbehaved so badly that he has not convincingly decided to convince the killers to hire employers. At least we have guesses. No character whatsoever has been developed for the bank's owners or bank staff. <br /> <br /> A very long delay in anything happens. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous assumption that Martin still needs to see the judge after the gang admitted to kill her brother-in-law. More absurd that he recognizes the ruling and the judge will not listen to a man honorable. Ironically, Martin hung up, and then Sharif took him at gunpoint to finally return to his hometown and rescue his wife from a bad bank employee. Will not he return after a quick dispatch to the gang to save the wife and arrest a bad man? Just sent the judge a confession recognized by the gang before you kill her on her way ???? !!! Overall, the representation is very sad and not a point for the film.
