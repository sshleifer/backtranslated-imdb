It took 9 years to complete this film. I think during those nine years someone had said, hey, this movie is terrible. I've seen acting better in pornographic movies. The story is tired and played. The abused child becomes a serial killer. What about something new to change. How about abuse turns into a florist? At least this will be a new development. Why does everyone think he has a camera and a film idea (especially non-original movies) that he can have a way out? I am impressed with the fact that they are holding this film for 9 years to complete it. This shows perseverance and spirit. With this kind of leadership, hopefully next time they can focus on them on a better script. If you want to see a failed experience in independent filmmaking from a Michigan writer / director, check out the hate of the moment. If you want a good film from the writer / director of Michigan with Evil Dead.
