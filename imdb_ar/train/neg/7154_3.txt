This movie contains all the benefits of many chefs who spoil the soup. Based on the biography of Sheila Graham, it seems that powers that can not be left well alone are sufficient. They could not determine whether this would be the story of Graham or Fitzgerald's story, nor how much should they be a soft pedal of a story that turned out to be. So the film, which could have been a story about two adorable characters (Fitzgerald) and a notorious character (Mrs Graham) becomes a disorganized soap opera about this tells us little about either. In addition, there is no period you feel at all in 1959. A clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time passes. However - this is what the film saved for me - Kerr was never loved, as Beck was always a very handsome man. They really make a beautiful couple and mature, and I just wish they had better materials to work with. There is one successful scene - Scott is chasing Sheila while he is drunk, and seeing these two stars knocking on each other is very disturbing and gives a quick idea of ​​what is going on in a relationship like their scene. Otherwise, the film is a lost opportunity and nowhere near the classic status of the soap of the other father, produced in 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, the best thing in all).
