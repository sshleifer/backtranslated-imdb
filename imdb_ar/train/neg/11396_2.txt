The cheap erotic master of horror, Rolf Kanievsky, is finally making a film that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" is heavily borrowed from everything from Nightmare in Elm Street to Evil Dead, but he is still able to do it with a spirit of humor enough to make it a spectacle ... barely. Cardboard characters, wooden dialogue, the story is thin, representatives were unable to get out of the grocery bag. Put all that together, and you'll get a ball of mulch in a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I love to eat paper. Watch this movie very much like. Bake for 90 minutes and you will have a strange taste in your mouth without food value.
