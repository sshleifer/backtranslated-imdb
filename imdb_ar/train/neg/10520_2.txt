Angels who got a bit of paradise and are now living in a British jungle where they seduce and cheat teenagers are banned. Talking about high concept. On the positive side, this small mother, Tom Savini, gives us, but since his acting time is limited to two minutes of show time, his presence in five minutes seems long. Angels revolve around the naked forest in the bulk of the film, but although they may have an angel body, it is certain that their faces look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. The humble effects and amateur representation do not help in night scenes and remember the most famous Paris Hilton movies. So bad it's so bad.
