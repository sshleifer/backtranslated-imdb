An incredibly terrible film. I've seen part of this on T.V. Recently. My jaw fell when I saw a horrifying picture plot and listened to a group of amazing minds. No one line of the hardcore master can come up with anything resembling a chuckle. It was so bad that I wanted to take out the body of Rodney Dangerfield, slap it around me and yell, "How can you?" I know that many films are made in haste, hoping to benefit from the popularity of a particular actor or subject. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It is sad and frightening that people were expected to pay for seeing such a place. The bottom of the sink, even by TV standards on a Sunday afternoon.
