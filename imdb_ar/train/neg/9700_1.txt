I agree with most other players. Waste of photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> There is hardly a joke worth writing. The highlight of my view is Bove Ole Dietrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds us of old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performance of actors, since most of them do not seem to be having fun during production and are only doing something. The camera is fine, the plot is ridiculous, and I think you would be ashamed even if I discussed this with lots of beer. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I was inconspicuous all the time and wondered how such a script could think of production and waited until the end. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son was delighted, but then he was very happy with this age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, the 1 point rating here is almost 1 point over Required ...
