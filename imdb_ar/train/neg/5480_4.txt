It was 1 am and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We came back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group has made its way to an island. It does not take long before you encounter a large "reptile" devouring its horse. Soon they are captured by the indigenous people and in order to gain freedom, they must kill "reptile gods". CG absorbs; reminds me CG video games early control unit. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this subject is Hottie, who was running in tights. Otherwise it is just an average effort.
