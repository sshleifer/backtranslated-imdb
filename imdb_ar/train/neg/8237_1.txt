How was this movie distributed, in the name of everything that is sacred? It seems as though he has been filmed on someone's mobile phone and takes a victim's screaming girl scenario into entirely new depths. They literally scream for 90 minutes full of film. That's all they do. There is no conspiracy, no tension, no figures, and not much representation. Just scream and scream more. <br /> <br /> She surrendered after fifteen minutes and was quickly wounded to see if anything had happened. No - except for shouting, of course. It is interesting to say that the process of moving it forward quickly highlights another problem - there is no camera work to talk about. Each shot resembles every other shot - middle distance, single angle, boring, boring, boring. <br /> <br /> It's not too bad, it's good. It's just bad bad.
