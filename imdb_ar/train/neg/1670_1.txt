The premise of the film is scary: a woman gets sick when a stranger accepts him in a bar. <br /> <br /> But once the movie starts, a horrific opening scene proves that this is a C-Sci-Fi movie. It's a great Star Trek program and simple X files, but more than anything else it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts to work, everything becomes predictable and trivial. It looked like part 2 in a television series a bad science fiction. No suspense nor excitement, but not for no attempt. Just a dramatic contrast between major characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
