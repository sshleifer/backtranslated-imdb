First, I must admit that both of the films that I saw this director saw him without titles, so I missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but having sat in two of his movies, I wish I had not even tried to learn. Samutari is very cool. The road is very cool. It is about ten different story lines woven and graduated together. This is not very strange in a town the size of Prague (very small, really.) The main characters range from 20 to 30. They have only got jobs and studies. The best figure is a small Balkan girl. Migrants repeat their feelings here every day. That's about it. The only great person. Everyone else makes their lives hell completely on their own. How can I empathize with this apparent deficit? Maybe there are interesting parts with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in the film? If you love good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like sarcastic and dry humor, Jarmusch senses the original and is not a tradition. Under no circumstances, he saw Ondricek, Septej (whisper). This is unless you enjoy homosexuality stereotypes.
