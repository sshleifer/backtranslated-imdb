A textual introduction warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house, but I think the most appropriate word is entropy. Good grief, what is going on these two children! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is the only one in his office in San Francisco and his very expensive house in Tiburon while his wife and child are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colin Camp in Donna's role) clung to his door and inquired about the directions. Well, it's raining, they tremble like two tiny little cats, unsure of the address they're looking for, what George calls something and invites them to come and take part. Pizza on fire. The three of them end up bathing in the George Basin and follow them about five minutes of nondiscriminatory nudity mostly in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night in the trio and the next morning the girls fix his breakfast. But something has stirred a bit of anger because Georgian guests are devouring everything with their fingers and pouring ketchup and juices all over the linen - "You eat like anime!" , George shouted and told them to come out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an unusual young blond with blue eyes of cobalt and Colin Camp jumps like a superhero. You have to say, they are born ugly in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes, and they breed very politely too, where we can only observe after the first five or ten minutes. <br /> <br /> But when the girls go wild, so does the movie. The film is then immersed in a bright green light. The couple wore a fine dress and made a face from the mirror in mirrors. They test a child of birth and then drown him to make sure. They storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes where two people sit across the table from each other, licking food and then jumping on each other's bones. <br /> <br /> George? First, they make an unconscious Georgie (which contains nothing you can not find in the small red bottle of MacCellini's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), tie it, pour the flour and milk all over it, and subject it to a psychotic experience, putting it in a quasi-execution The Tolstoy standing around, slapping around him, wearing exotic costumes, and then going on and his home from the upper class actually destroyed, and sent by a machina delivery car. <br /> <br /> For acting, it seems as if someone has told Georgi, "The first polite behavior of these girls, then panic after I was restricted." The girls: "The first act shy, unwilling to impose on anyone, and then acted madly." That's it. <br /> <br /> Photography and location work directly outside a pornographic film from the 1970s. I'm not sure this indicates a complete lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly. The result gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgi is some popular music with the words "freedom" and "surrender". Jackson and Donna is a catchy catchy thing called "My Good Old Father". <br /> <br /> I agree with the moral lesson behind the story. There are some things that you do not have to surrender to, though they may seem a lot fun at first. All educational too.
