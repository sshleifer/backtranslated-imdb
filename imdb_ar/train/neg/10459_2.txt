A blurred, unclear, bad scenario, photography and bad direction ... In general, it is very clear that the first poorly conceived effort in commercial filmmaking by the good people at TPN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has been very successful in the past by helping bring "China Cry," the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But the "Omega symbol" is a regrettable mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs and loves "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They do a lot for their service, but that's not an example. Do not waste your money ... Go to the "China Cry" rental instead.
