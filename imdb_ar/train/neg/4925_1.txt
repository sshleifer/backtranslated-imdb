Please do not waste your time. This film depicts the worst events of Bram Stoker Dracula (Van Helsing) and Anne Rice Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly scriptural references) and Blade (high tech games). I really love vampire movies and novels, and there are many very good ones. But this is not stinky. Not even the soundtracks help her, mostly because the film resorts to ridiculous, ridiculous, rather than "kicking metal" music that some have mentioned. Only a few times I heard any metal. Violin was often tortured. Avoid it like garlic and steel.
