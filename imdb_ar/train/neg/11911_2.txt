I sat adhering to the screen, concentrating, yawning, yet I watched closely. I waited for the next dreadful special effect, or a ridiculous plot element to show its full strength, so I could figure out how to make a film. <br /> <br /> The film watched the crew all the action movies / science fiction / shoot / good versus the villain movie at all, and watched the wonderful things and said: "Hey, we can do it." For example, the only car parked a mile away as a one-way road with a non-parking shoulder is the only car to be thrown by the hero, an attractive brunette born of bile. The car explodes into pieces before landing. Surely the special effects were the biggest beef in this film. But what really put it in my bad books is the lack of credibility and lack of reason for many of the elements! For example, the opponent, an aviation demon with the ability to hurt in strange ways, happens in a single military truck transporting important important figures. Unidentified security men with guns coming out of the truck, you know they have already died. "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" Says the man who protects VIPs. He goes out to find the monster who killed his 3 comrades, was beaten in a roughly vulgar way. Then without a clear reason, defies logic, agreement, common sense, dumb ass VIP come out of the truck! Much of what happened along the film did not make sense. Transparent representation has kept me away from the film, as well as from the bad camera work, and the things that make you go: "Wow, that's unbelievably cheesy." Cherie Appleby saved the movie from 1, because it gave the film the only element that makes viewers always enjoy the experience and sexual attraction.
