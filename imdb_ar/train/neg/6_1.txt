Since the beginning of the film, I have been given the feeling that the director is trying to photograph something. What I mean is that instead of the story dictating the way the film should be made, he went in the opposite direction, and wrote a story to suit it. He has failed so badly. I think he was trying to make a neat movie. Anyway, I think this movie is a waste of time and effort. It's thanks to the director that he knows the media he works with, and what I'm trying to say is that I've seen worse films. Here at least the director knows to maintain continuity in the film. It also gave actors a decent performance.
