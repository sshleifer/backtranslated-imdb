Priyadarshan / Vohra flicked off another film that was seen on TP instead of actual desire, and the only reason I saw in this film was the fact that regulars were not present in this film (Akshay Parish and many others), but needless to say I had expectations Low of this film. <br /> <br /> I was happy with songs in general except for Rajpal Yadav, which bothers once again without limits, but he draws some laughs, but this was a standard joke, not the original jokes. In fact, this whole movie is like playing dhol, Hardly any talent to cause a high fuss, or even play a good alien tune on the dhol for a short period of time? It is only those who can carry different blows in a nice sequential way, for a long time they are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to the other instrument, Dumroo hardly requires any talent, does not have any differences, and may have fun for a while dancing the monkey (they seem like Rajpal Yadav, a good analogy), but it is not a tool that will You enjoy your long time or even make you dance as Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie was like dhol and dumroo that runs, sometimes Dhol sometimes plays dumroo, sometimes together, but mostly Dumroo was playing alone and dancing a monkey. Like any 24-year-old youngster, I was bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good Dhol moments, but after a while, I heard the annoying Dumroo (amusing at first, then acceptable and then disturbing)), Basic for a few funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not seen it on Filmy, it will come in the evening and it's very funny). <br /> <br /> This movie went through its moments, the actors did a good job, with the exception of Rajpal Yadav (who can act, I saw it in Main Meri Patni ??) which bothers more than entertainment, I have said it several times and I will say it again , I really think that Sharman Joshi and Toshar Kapoor have a wonderful career in front of them in multi-star comedy especially. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny like failed attempts to impress the father of girls, trying to adulterer to attract the girl and take them away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after that, there was a strenuous attempt to turn this movie into much more with the addition of a puzzle, meaning that once the girl entered, the next 45 to 60 minutes was more tortuous, and the culmination was "SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY ", I mean what they were thinking if you had to be nervous, you should at least make some attempts to make it palatable. <br /> <br /> As the movie is very predictable, there is hardly a scene you can not predict and will not turn into a spontaneous explosion of laughter here, it seems like seeing him coming and starts laughing almost before a gag. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd extrusion, down or up, then quickly retreating down once you have made friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes were really bad at the end, as the film tries to be more than just a comedy track and many jokes were easy. Trivial and boasting of repetition, the last 10-15 was particularly spoiled by MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Tanushree Datta did not find the siren she was playing completely, and her acting talent is a serious issue, especially given her unattractive appearance, if you cant and can not act how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically too, this film was weak, with a steady female look and poor lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> Songs except the title track were not good either. When the songs were played in the second half, I felt a collective passion from the audience. <br /> <br /> In every movie, this is only normal because of the actors, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding that would not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> If you should watch it while watching it for free or on a very cheap device or if it is a must if you pay full double rates, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> - Lots of meaningless jokes, Ragbal Yadav, 45 minutes at least, and at least 15 minutes, technically bad, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- Trying to be more than it was, not a regular cast (I'm happier for that), Tanushri Data. <br /> <br /> + s + Some good scenes towards the beginning, title song, good representation and representation except RY. <br /> <br /> Total 4.5 / 10 (I try to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this film achieved my very low expectations, so I give it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was no more Of 4)
