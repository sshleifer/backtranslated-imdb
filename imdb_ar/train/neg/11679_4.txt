First, this film is not "exciting." No it is "gripping, taut." This may be script-based, but the slow pace of the trend makes it difficult to access. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and creative. Unfortunately, we only recognize the * how * genius after the image ends. This leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences with music played on them and interspersed with some scenes of motion that do not attract the viewer, and scenes of "cunning cunning" that inject a more explicit intelligence. <br /> <br /> I hope this is the quick film promised by the Fund. It was a wonderful movie. Instead, Spike Lee made it to the bottom.
