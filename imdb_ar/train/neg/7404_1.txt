I first got an interest in this film after reading a review that says this movie mentions references to Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a great admirer of Silent Hill, and disappointed by his first appearance in the film, I thought I would give this film a chance. Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Dark Floors", not by its full name so when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits I immediately thought of the band (I had a few friends in college they like), but I did not think it was No matter how soon I pushed the idea sideways. <br /> <br /> The movie begins strongly. Despite the fact that a "creepy little girl" had been made to die, the good use of sound and the sense of isolation began to assemble the story together. The tense atmosphere was quickly built, and each sign indicated that the film was excellent. Because the monsters are the real stars of horror, I could not wait to see what was lurking in the hospital halls, where the main characters found themselves trapped ... <br /> <br /> Then the first monster showed up and found myself soaked. By the time the second film appeared, I was distracted by the fact that it seemed to come from Megadeth's concert, and I was totally amazed. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the atmosphere remained intact, leaving the story wondering only what was happening, but the fears were largely absent. However, I wish that the end would make it worth it. Unfortunately, it was not. As the film reached its peak, I was in total disbelief, and I immediately realized the great villains in his latest revelation ... Lordi's main singer? seriously? <br /> <br /> Was this what the film acquired? A bunch of poor souls are being chased by members of the Lourdes band around the hospital? Suddenly silly monster design makes sense. If you're going to be vulgar, maybe through members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS there too. Not to mention the fact that I'm quite sure I saw the end in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. Did they have to go and make the whole movie get out of it? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I found out what was really going on, all I could manage was a depression. I will not "destroy" it for you, but I can safely say it's probably a conspiracy machine I've seen before. More than once. <br /> <br /> So, unless you are a fan of the mighty Lordi, stay away from this. This is not scary, it brings nothing new to the table (although it does a good job borrowing from other horror movies, especially Silent Hill). And I can not stress this enough, Lordi is the opponent. Pink. Talk about the buzz. <br /> <br /> Really, it would be better for you to frighten yourself than watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, this is not possible.
