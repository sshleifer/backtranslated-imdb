The strange charisma of Martin Koslik brings some credibility to his character to the frustrated artist. He drinks his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character is able to appear as a real person and not a typical villain for "B". <br /> <br /> The story line is not writable on the home page, and many scenes are dim. What makes it work is the exotic chemistry between Couslec and Rondo Hatton as a creep. The philosophical character shown in Koslik contrasts with the monotonous Hatton approach. Creeper's character is not developed beyond the level of the basic beast, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his background story. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the scene of much trauma when I was a child, so I have some nostalgic fondness for it. It is worth watching once, anyway, for those who enjoy the 40 horror movies.
