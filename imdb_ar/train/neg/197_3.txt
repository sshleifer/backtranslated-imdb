While James Arens was a great Westerner, the film was dropped as the worst film by Alamo. The story was awful, the inaccuracies in it all, frankly lies in the boot! He cast the continuity of the four winds. Anyone catch a gun sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to launch the cannons, which was clear that mud and rocks were still coming out of the pipes. Come on! Then there's the silly Brian Keith hat! The fashion designer must be away or something. Or just from their minds!
