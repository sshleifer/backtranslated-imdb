A vision of a man subjected to attack by the zombie gave me hope that Lucio would be "zombie" Folsi at the level of his old trick. Unfortunately, unlike those close to a rotting body, there is nothing to recommend in this story about the murder of a rich man and his daughter's quest to find out who killed him. None of the characters are attractive and by the time you discover how they did it (this distortion was, at least, wonderful), stop caring. The only good thing I can say is that it is more logical than a nightmare party!
