Such a long-awaited movie .. But disappointed me and my friends who went to watch the film on the first day .. Of the sections that looked like an action film, but turned out to be a comedy out (bad comedy). But the thing that deserves recognition is the representation of these professional actors, they played the film very well. Good behavior, but I do not think he can save the film .. India has been shot beautifully. Both Kerala and Rajasthan (Ladakh) were full of color. However, the way in which the beauty of these places was captured made me want to know where these places were and when I could go ;-) <br /> <br /> The series of events were filmed in a very poor way, and no one could do that. At the top of the tail of the stunts, they used Akki (Akshay Kumar) very well but could have done much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I have seen in modern films (90 films had better animation scenes (the first scene where the car falls "the plane must be the best word" the road to the lake). <br /> < The name of the films has been mentioned every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure that the audience does not forget the name of the movie I think ..
