A one-note comedy may put modernist feminist teeth on the edge of the abyss. Betsy Drake's shopkeeper adores the idea of ​​birth and marriage, and pinned her hopes on women's magazines to spy on stylish student Carrie Grant. The rest of the film slips from one trick to another as Drake relentlessly follows her quarry. I think that the word "fun" is almost the way Drake in this role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of keeping the dentures, she started taking an overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and lacking his usual inclination. There is one scene, however, that almost saves this slim exercise. Drake inquires about the miserable grant after his lecture to a group of respectable ladies. Here the way of its joy is characterized by an amazingly unrivaled freshness, and if the production does not rub our breath in that 90-minute optimistic smile, the film may be more than a girls camp day dream, around 1948.
