For years I remember reading about this "Trouble with Tracy" presentation in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto Every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived about two hours by car north of Toronto and could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to see about what was going on was "Trouble with Tracy". Does she have a beautiful girl in a starring role? Was there nudity? Was there a thrill? Was it a comedy? It was fine if there was some promotion of the show. At least I could know what I was missing. but not! I was ambushed to win the fight, until CTV's CKCO built a transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6am !! On a Saturday morning, I woke up and prepared the TV at 5:59 and finally got to see "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content stuck at 6:00 am harmless, so no one saw the extent of his atrocities. <br /> <br /> The talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many argue that he actually "died" the first time he appeared in the show. When I first saw her on a cold Saturday morning and fell back to my bed, part of me also died.
