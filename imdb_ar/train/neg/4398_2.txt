Tim Robbins and John Kozak were the best actors in their career, and that was the only reason they chose to watch this film. Well, all I can say is I regret it completely! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the time by doing a number of unimaginative, unimaginable, and maximalist (and not bad) self-portraits that are supposed to make people laugh, but they fail. The only reason I can think of is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his film by starring in it - I can not think of anything else because this film is very cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Kozak have not disappointed me since. I recommend avoiding this movie, unless you spoil your opinion of actors.
