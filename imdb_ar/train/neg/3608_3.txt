I have a nice collection of running movies, and this group has been added to it. No. 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title made me go first. University of sprinkling. I thought this would be a great horror film. I was wrong at all. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst film I have ever seen, but it could have been much better. I loved all the movies, but this film was more laughable than scary. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor representation and poor operating arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfect for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of these movies to enjoy it, this one!
