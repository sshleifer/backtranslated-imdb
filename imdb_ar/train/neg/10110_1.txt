This film was by far the worst film I have ever seen. I'm not even kidding. It was badly made and actors were unable to act. It was a waste of time and money. It was like a movie that my friends and I could say on our own. The issue in which the film is definitely camouflaged. Nothing in the film resembles a zombie on the front of the box. It seems that the director or make-up artist has put the black eye liner just under the eyes of someone called zombie. Credits at the beginning of the film take about 20 minutes of film. Who was watching the credits was the best part of the film. This was frankly a terrible film and I could not believe how bad it was. The scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes they were like "What's going on?" The sound was terrible and the thrill footage looked like a pair of teenagers joking about creating a fake combat scene. <br /> <br /> If you're considering renting or buying this movie, I recommend you watch the trailer at least because it shows how terrible it really is. I wish I had seen him before I hired him.
