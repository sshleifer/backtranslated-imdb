This was a fucking film with a predictable story and horrible acting !! Willy Nelson was as tough as his braids. The film looked like a very long ad about Jessica Simpson's light red lipstick - especially as there are many close friends on her face. The premise was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo can be expected. All that was spent on making this film was a waste of curiosity. Any hints of the other old Marilyn Monroe films did not promote the movie Blonde Ambition at all. It was so unbelievable - that Jessica Simpson was able to take over as executive secretary in a hat - she was laughable !!!
