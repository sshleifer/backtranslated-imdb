A particularly damaging example of an Italian cult cinema with a meaningless title to take off (if anything, the devil's alternative is less relevant to the scheme!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a powerful dose of Erotica) only competes with a kind of cover Air around? Actually offset by a deal which is frankly appalling! Here, we get the usual group of people who are stranded on an island (they have been invited to them by Count? S since she became passionate about the eminent lady, a dead woman in his lost wife)! The characters are pretty much stereotypes: a middle-aged but dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi Stewart and who bears the history of his family more than his share of the violent tragedy), a shrewd heroine, a fallen companion (reminding Mai West and the more annoying nuisance of much!), (Luciano Begosi is everywhere, once participating in the event, if you know what I mean), the housekeeper of Enud (the star), a lesbian, The nominal Femi Pinochet, although it is well worth it, it is already a band piece), a religious fanatic of the Chok server Si, the owner of an impressive deceptive room, and so on. Means unreachable, terrible dubbing, snail frequency, poor production (with scenes depicting the raging sea raised from some black and white movies!) And the fact that murders occur only during the half hour closing does not help things. Besides, the result of Marcello Giumpini, though nice in itself, is disproportionately modern under these circumstances; however, the revelation proves to be astonishingly amazing (given that there is certainly no shortage of suspects Here).
