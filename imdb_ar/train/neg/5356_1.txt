I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. A c-grade pornographic film reminds me of one main difference: no pornographic. <br /> <br /> Story and dialogue need a thorough reform. Maybe then the bad behavior was not noticeable. At least, the speed was supposed to be captured. <br /> <br /> While I agree that this budget was low and that the director did a good job visually because of the few resources available to him, he should have spent more time in the story or better, make someone else write it. Many of the scenes were futile. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
