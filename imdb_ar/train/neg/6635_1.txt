Four years after his debut, he made his debut with the annual "Welcome to L.A." , Alan Rudolph tells us that what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be a player. "Roadie" is a brawl of full-fledged boy fights with baromas, horny guitars, Art Carney in a wheelchair ... and a loaf of meat on the wheel. (The Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a rather enchanting presence on the screen, and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better film) it may actually be innovative, but the Zalman King scenario is full of typical and helpless humor. And Moroni. Alice Cooper, Rui Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondy all appear - all look embarrassing. Surely they should have a "Roadie" bad trip. No stars from ****
