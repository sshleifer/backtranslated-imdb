Shirley Jackson's novel Haunting of Hill House is a horror story in the air that conveys supernatural phenomena in an old palace. The atmosphere is good setting, chills are organized well. Horrible masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Haunting, 1963, remains closely linked to the book, but also adds its details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, so book horror and chills are performed better on the screen. Only black-and-white photography adds to the movie's creep. Excellent! <br /> <br /> After that, Jean de Bon made this. In 1999, a new edition of The Haunting Cinemas hit - if you could call this a new version. Why they had to make a new copy of the 1963 film is a puzzle in itself, but for now, let's take a look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> The show starts on average, as do most horror movies. The group at Hill House is oddly beautiful and mysterious, and for a few minutes seems like a fair story. Next, the first fear comes: a loose guitar wire cuts the woman's face (assistant Dr. Marrow). This is a hilarious thing, and it is true that he almost cried. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film has only been sliding. It seems that the acting has become rather woody as the film continues, though Owen Wilson's character is particularly irritating (so be relieved when he stitches the chimneys). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this film practically practical, a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Many examples, so I will not bother listing them. <br /> <br /> So, overall, in addition to hundreds of others, I highly recommend watching the original radiator, or alternative, buying Shirley Jackson's novel. But please, stay away from this. If you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (where you like a lot of channels to view this movie, not the original) or rent it cheap, but please do not buy it, no matter what you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final assessment: 4/10
