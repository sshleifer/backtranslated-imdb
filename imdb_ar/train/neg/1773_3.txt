my dear! "Horror" was rarely bored or made me laugh like a movie. After a startling start with an interesting hypothesis, it does not descend more than just the slippery flick, with some supernatural and sexual aspects. Alice Krige is usually lost in this excellent game, and the plot changes are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you are really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
