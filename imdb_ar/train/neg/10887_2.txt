...... This movie is very terrible, the only thing that prevents me from giving one estimate is the fact that I unfortunately saw what is worse. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, annoying demons, and blood / teeth / eyes in the form of UV fluorescent give it a "terrible" look, and the scenario is awesome ..... This movie is like testing to see how long it can last before giving up As predictable but not in a good way. Nothing the film does is in a good way. I watched him 10 minutes ago and thought I would bother you a bit so you're here. (Oh and representation does not disappoint the film, it is also terrible)
