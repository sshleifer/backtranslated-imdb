You may have heard this phrase when it comes to this film? "Herbie: Fully loaded with crap" and yes that's true. This film is really horrible and completely lame. <br /> <br /> This will be the second worst film Lindsay has ever seen since the teenage drama queen confessions. It seems that the only good thing about this film is more than the talent of the cast which is much better than the film million times and is the only selling point for the film. I do not see how a respected actor like Matt Dillon can be part of this film, do not you read this horrible scenario before you sign in to be there? <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this film also depends on the extent to which Herbie is surreal and fantastical like the extraordinary ability to climb on the wall and move faster than the car racers after all just Beatle. I know it's a movie for kids but they followed it and did it more absurd than entertainment. Little realism is needed, in addition to the story being largely predictable. <br /> <br /> Final Words: Unless children are actually 5-12 years old, I strongly doubt anyone can enjoy this senseless film. What waste my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
