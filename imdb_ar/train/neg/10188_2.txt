This cute flick events is exclusively for teenagers in old man bodies, desperate to regain adolescent adolescence a hormonal challenge. What ? Through the burning of gas and equality between the car (or plane) fast and reckless freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot is heavily borrowed from the neighborhood of Mr. Rogers (if run by a group of oil companies) and Rogen Ran (if she was heavily drugged and lacked a sense of elegance). <br /> <br /> Starring Le Magors and Bourges Meredith, this film is set in a post-gas crisis world where you do not want a strong government to drive your car and burn gas. In contrast to the current government of Enron and Bush, the government that oversees oil and SUVs. <br /> <br /> This approximation alone makes the movie laugh. But wait there more. Although the film was set up in the future, we did not show any signs of future technology, except for cycling, horseback riding and horseback riding. You will believe that the future looks ... just like today. Same clothes, the same houses in the suburbs, the same green meadows as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions on alternative energy. <br /> <br /> The representation is flat and delicious. Even scenes that could have been angry or animated, flick about friends, honor, romance, horror ... all fall over a paper doll under a bag. <br /> <br /> Continuity is missing - jet The character of Burgess Meredith changes color and composition from moment to moment as filmmakers insult our intelligence through unparalleled stock footage over and over again. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely magnificent and half of it is as dramatic as a Dukes Hazard episode. <br /> <br /> Even brave car movies and SF fans should avoid this movie as a month-long contest unless you enjoy watching Exxon executives try to make the film as empty as the hero's gas tank.
