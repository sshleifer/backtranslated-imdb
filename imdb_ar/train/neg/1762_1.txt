It seems that this film is torn from many films that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the viewer in the future be warned in advance that "Art Heist" does not add anything to this type. Director Brian Guerres does not have anything to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin continues to reappear in films. Frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or that producers and producers love his work. He seems an idiot, and praised this strange hairstyle he sports in most of his films. The only good film in which he appeared was "Squid and Whale", in which he speaks only about two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, the lady of his leadership, was no better off; there was no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie that can be watched by the viewer.
