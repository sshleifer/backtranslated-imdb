There is an interesting discussion in this film. Are you a good enough moral person, or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without God's guidance, being moral is not enough. There is an early line in the film, "You and I can look at a morally good person, but both know he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> While I am not a Christian, discussions on this subject throughout the film have been fascinating, but not in the way the film intended. I left the film with a stronger feeling that being moral enough is enough. The arguments and discussions presented were so biased that they crushed themselves in the weight of their ignorance. Intolerance can be a powerful thing, especially when it is deduced in ignorant and uneducated minds. As George Carlin's character in Dogma said: "Connect during their youth." <br /> <br /> The basic premise is also a very interesting idea. A biblical scholar of the 1890s tries to publish a book that says morality without God is good, as long as morality is meaningful. Do you tell the child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to do so? (The author wants to recommend that his school recommend selling books to spread the world.) The author, Carlisle, wants to sell the book. However, it needs unanimous approval, and is opposed by one scientist. Poses, in a very interesting early discussion of the film about morality for morality versus the argument of God's words. To prove his point of view, he produced the Time Machine (placed in the film only to make the plot work, and I am fine with it), and Carlisle sends to 2002 to see where the teaching of ethics leads us without God. <br /> <br /> It must also be clear, he has his opinion, and is changed as he sees it, and reflected himself by the time of his return (because he does not return, this is not really a spoiler, it is the Holy Book of the film after all). <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it is very slow and acts very badly. Something that was not required * in this film, is that it produces "two bad people" wanting to try to figure out who Carlyle is, even if he did not hurt anyone, or committed a crime, or anything. What's wrong with Carlisle's view of the film, showing his vision of this "wrong world" and bringing it back to a new perspective? <br /> <br /> Also, there are a few points in the film that assure me that I am happy because I am not a Christian, or at least someone who says "it is God or nothing". Three near the end of the film somewhat annoyed me .. First, when the corner of the "bad guys" Carlisle before jumping directly, Carlisle performs his despicable work only *. Jesus, and makes him so "wicked" (who are also Christians, similarly strange), believe that they have missed ecstasy. <br /> <br /> Second, after Carlisle's return, a young man is found scolded at the beginning of the film about not stealing (but without mentioning God, keeping the child on the marble and running away), and telling him the time when the theft was wrong because God ordered it. Like Carlin's above quotation, the intimidation of children to religion is a fake in my book. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conclusion. Another intimidating tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far they can go in the future, and says he does not know. The ending appears to him as he tries to tarnish the gospel in the distant future (beginning in 2100), and fails ... it continues to fall. After ten years, try again, by vanishing, be in 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carles mentions that he felt that the end of the world was coming, because the world was full of sin and the loss of God's name. The methods of terror have been used for thousands of years. You were thinking about these enlightened times, and the enlightened church as well. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was fairly sure before they were morally good enough, I know that now on the ground. Worth seeing if you are not a Christian, to confirm your happiness because you are not as ignorant as people in this film.
