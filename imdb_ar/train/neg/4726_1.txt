Another film about a polite personality centered around the self, arrogant, insensitive, destroys itself and defeats itself. We should care about them. <br /> <br /> Wall movies with a leading character are of a strong destructive nature. What I object to about this one is that there is very little background to this guy. Why does this man hate himself and the world? If they treated the text with this more they might have been able to raise some sympathy with him. As it is, appears only as an unpleasant unpleasant personality, not a tragic, but merely a hate. <br /> <br /> After doing his best to make this man as crazy and hostile to society as possible and make his fate dark, the writer may then have the nerve to end a happy ending .... <br /> <br /> This is not The worst film I've ever seen in my life, it's even a good fight! a man! do not waste your time.
