I saw Brigadier on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and I watch movies as long as I remember them. I can honestly say that the Brigadier stands alone apart from the worst film I have ever seen. Accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better groups. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry from the tears of the shepherds who had the misfortune to watch them. It is hoped that the stars of this film will be hidden enough to protect them from the embarrassment they experienced when seeing this film. Owners of this trip must perform a wonderful service to mankind and destroy all copies of this movie.
