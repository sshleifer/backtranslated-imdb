Body Slam (1987) is a terrible film. Smoke is low budget, the trend is pedestrian (at best) writing and lame representation. But if you are in an old school wrestling (around the 70s to the mid-1980s) it will be more fun than ordinary scenes. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave him two because I felt like I was generous. This turkey was "guided" by the master of the Nedham Hull stunt. The stars are Rudy Piper, Tonga Kid and a group of enthusiastic wrestlers and actors on the list (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> About this "film" about promoter wants to combine "rock hair" and wrestling. But others do not want to succeed. There is a lot but I do not want to spoil it for you. If you can deal with the bad story and the acting, there are some surprises near the end of the hard wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my worst enemy (I mean).
