I watched the movie late one night on the cable and could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but the film was so exciting it was not amusing. Some of the highlights in this film include the absurd music that is constantly being played throughout the film, the hideous special effects (when someone is photographed with a laser gun that turns green and instantly decomposes), and disgusting acting. Acting, in fact, is what I feel as it steals the show. I did not know any of the actors in the film, and I hope I never have to see any of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; I can not imagine a video store carrying this trash) just so you can learn how to rate high quality movies after watching this trash.
