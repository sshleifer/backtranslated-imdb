I thought I would not find a horror film like "The Texas Massacre Massacre," but this film competes with him. <br /> <br /> I'm not asleep when I watch a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and began to watch him deserve it? The entire film was torture, but I had to use it quickly to see it full. <br /> <br /> I can not afford why one of my favorite representatives all the time (MR. WALKEN) did this thing. I must think that he made the director known, or needed money, because the film after the film does, it destroys itself; and quickly ... <br /> <br /> What about the film? It's not scary, or stupid conspiracy, the characters are horrible (but I really liked those played by Jared Harris), the effects are very bad, the lack of death, blood, etc.; in three words, he has nothing. And I mean it. I can not see how the director can produce such a film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was more disappointed when I watched the cover of the video, the movie was introduced by Stephen King, I think you can never make this crap, do you? (I hired it in Argentina). I would not recommend it for a million years. <br /> <br /> This movie was made with 2 out of 10. (As I said in my article "The Texas Massacre Return Massacre," there will always be the worst movies, that's why not worth 1 out of 10)
