There may be something poetic right in seeing dentists suffer. Suffer, in this truly depressing film, but they cause the public to suffer from pain in a group other than teeth too. If you want to watch a movie full of screaming children, their young children, sick children, lots of long long-meaning looks, a clogged wife, and the husband in question: everything is here for you. Boring, on the stretch, stand out as one of those examples that scream: Why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with some good singing. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make omelets.
