Crawl - "Your journey ends here." Some graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's all for this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot or story. There are no pet characters, well, "characters" are incorrect because you do not have a clue about someone really. I mean, they are being chased by something "weird" in the sewer (who is this thing? Why is it there?), This is very scary I think, but do I really care? no I do not. why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know whether I want to live or die. It is one-dimensional and depends on the sound effects and gold to scare you, which is rare. <br /> <br /> This film lacks any meaning or purpose. It seems like I'm asleep and missed about 45 minutes of building. Jumps directly to action. Basically, some women and her friends are locked up in the London subway, chasing a strange creature, and then eventually escaping it. <br /> <br /> Creep has his moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are fine, but that's not what makes a horror film fit, so unfortunately, everything will be lost. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. "I think I have to do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oh, no, I'm going to do the exact opposite because I'm going to do the opposite," he said. Blond stupid "thing. I hope they do not do it, it's done many times, it's boring and predictable. In fact, I am very upset because the silly woman has not been challenged by the symbolic creature of strange appearance. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is a movie tag line. Well, the journey ends creeping briefly in the film. If you have a few beers, get ready for your colleagues, then be sure to watch it by all means. But if you want something original and intelligent, avoid it.
