This film really shows his age. The print I saw was awful because of age, but there could be better prints there. However, this was not the main problem in the film. The problem is that although the film was produced in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with as little dialogue as possible (only a few sentences) scattered in the film with the most amateur. Sometimes the characters were turned upside down or were talking with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to hide their lips and hide the "cleaver" (?) The fact that the film was named. Well, it's true that this Czech film will need dubbing in several languages, but to do it that way was really stupid and clear. It seemed cheap. <br /> <br /> In general, the film looked low-budget and ridiculous. It is really shameful, because there was a good story - a young woman marries an older man either gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the twenty-first century, a few people were really willing to sit in this old mess. Even with some glimpses of Hedy Lamar naked (and rather cramped), not worth the trouble that accompanied the film when it first appeared. Even by 1933, this film was weak. The only interesting thing about the film is to see how Lamar looked different in 1933 compared to the charming image Hollywood made when it came to America - it looks like two very different people. <br /> <br /> Incomplete and technically insignificant film, I do not see how such reviews got rave. For technical problems alone, the film can not evaluate 10 or anything near it.
