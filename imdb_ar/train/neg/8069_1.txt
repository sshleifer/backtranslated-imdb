Soul Survivors, a disorder that is not homogeneous with a deafening track, is the latest version of "Who's Dead and Who's Alive" from horror movies. Two teenage couples, Sean, Cassie, Matt and Anabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before they break up until Thanksgiving, they make a final trip to a raving party in some of the burning churches at the suggestion of a babe. Salotti Annabel (Eliza Dushko, nicknamed Feith, the other vampire murderer). The motivational men are beginning to pay much attention to Cassi (Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that have never been explained, and long before the quartet leaves the party. While driving away in their SUVs, they are followed and then passed by the terrifying men who are powerless, who instantly and unintentionally deliberate 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a bad and fatal accident when the cars overturn Four-wheel drive over one of the dams and sink into a river. She killed Shawn (or she?), And Casi spends the rest of the film in the face of loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she is not chased by the ghost of Shawn or pursued by these fearsome men who are powerless. Much of the unwarranted inconsistency follows with the deterioration of Cassi's psychological state even more, until we reach the expected result. Who died and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this cleanser, who really cares?
