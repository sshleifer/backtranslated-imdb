I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and got a hey, no matter how stupid this movie, I'll get at least to see him kick some ass, right? Error. This is a dull, dismal mess of meaningless speech, inaccurate textual writing, and meaningless planning. There are a few motion scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and a few images that are filmed and edited so badly that you can not even determine what is happening in the world. The film also describes it as terrible, and it may be better to explain the folly of this film by the fact that it is supposed to include the Italian mafia ... except for all the Japanese! Avoid like plague - you'll see the best martial arts by looking through the local karate classroom window for five minutes.
