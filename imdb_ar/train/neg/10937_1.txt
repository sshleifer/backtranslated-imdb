Every period of time a movie will come so terrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I get tired all my days and can only save one soul from watching this movie, how great my joy will be. <br /> <br /> From where do I begin to discuss pain. For starters, there was a music montage every five minutes. There was no personal evolution. Each character was a stereotype. We had sworn the guy, the chubby guy who eats cakes, the stupid foreign man, etc. I felt the script as if she were writing as the film was filmed. The production value was so unbelievably low that I felt I was watching a small video presentation. Have directors, producers, etc. seen films before? Storm storm becomes worse and worse with each new entry. The concept of this film seemed very funny. How can you make a mistake with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors to some extent. But trust me when I say this, things went very wrong.
