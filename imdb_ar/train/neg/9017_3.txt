This movie caught on to science fiction before going to work. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cain diving and avoiding fire at least several times, this movie is right for you. If this is not at the height of your interest, well, I'm afraid you wish you were about to be blown up by the flames, because this movie is very bad. Acting, at first, awful, awful, awful. All the characters are totally repugnant, and the dialogue is worse than the Z-class Sci-Fi. In the end, the film reminds me of a "hollow man" (complete escape through the elevator shaft), except the dragon, not a naked naked man. Unlike other similar clicks, this was not so bad ... it was very bad.
