Most viewers seem to know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary, and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe as well as Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten experiences throughout Europe) was a revenge and injustice to the winners. What do you think, why were not any of the American, British, French or Soviet defendants after World War II? Were there no American, British, and other war crimes? There were no Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Dresden, Hamburg, Berlin, Katyn, etc.? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point is: Dirham victory! Germany must be destroyed! (This was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is a horrible American brainwashing tool filled with error, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. First of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why was not enough of the Nuremberg process itself? This film is a nightmare. Darkness after 60 years! This darkness (hatred, narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, and so forth. There are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! very smart. Even Stalin becomes envious of him ...
