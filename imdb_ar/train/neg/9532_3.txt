So this guy named George sits at home alone on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in a hospital looking after her two children. When the wife is away, George gets a bubble bath and loves girls. It's not great for the scene because it really does not show anything. Then the Christmas boy wakes up the next morning, and the girls are still at his home. They make it a nice breakfast but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to get rid of him, but when he gets home, the girls are still at home. The girls had grown up with old George and no longer wanted to cook for them. They both turned out to be big mental patients and used George in his crazy little game. I loved that the girls did what they wanted and spoiled George's house. George was not really great for his hosts. When George said he was a married man, he did not seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on the Guy family. I was for the two girls all the time.
