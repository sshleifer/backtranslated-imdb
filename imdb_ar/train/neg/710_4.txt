I read Rice's novel with interest, and became fascinated by her characters and a tragic story based on historical facts. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply comfortable with this catastrophic adjustment. The choice was based on physical appearance only, not on decency (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who had no blond hair, or was unable to dispose of a wet paper bag). The attempts by clumsy and inconsistent actors to influence a cheerful French tone, but not in an amusing way. I found myself watching this confused and melodramatic journey, and I was surprised that I had reached the end. <br /> <br /> Warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this novel.
