Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone this Christmas. Not only is the millionaire. But also abhorrent and guilty of being too great. Drew returns to the house where he grew up and gives the family living there, Falco, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Falco (James Gandolfini) is hesitant, but greedy enough to take a Drew show. Christine Falco (Catherine O'Hara) has nothing to say about it, but she learns that she loves to walk around ... not exactly the same feelings with her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but that's also a field for change. His girlfriend Drew Messi (Jennifer Morrison) is tracking Drew and wants to meet her family with his family. The real pleasure in the store is that Noel's happy becomes a mixed sub-nightmare. Other members of the team: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Messi, David Silby and Stephanie Farassy. Aflick Comedy, albeit strange.
