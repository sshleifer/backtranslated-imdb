I really do not have any idea why some people find that PBS Power Rangers is interesting at all. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people who play them are completely foolish at the same time. There is absolutely nothing remotely interesting about Power Rangers. This is just a high-priced TV ad designed to sell plastic garbage that is very delightful for unsuspecting children around the world. From observations, I can see that it was banned in New Zealand and from what I saw, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this offer at all costs, it is terrible and ridiculous.
