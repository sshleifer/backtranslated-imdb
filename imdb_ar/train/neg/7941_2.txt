As the end of 2000 drew to a close, King Kong's adoptive daughter passed away and made a close declaration. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was torn, I was laughing and screaming like an Indian wild from the Old West. <br /> <br /> What does Oprah do? She takes celebrities and puts them in her program. What kind of people are famous? People who have suffered (just like them, except for those who have lost more than their virginity) have suffered from real faces, missing limbs (a true story, and the end of the paragraph) and husband abuse (too many). Bethany Hamilton, I have heard your story about the loss of a shark's arm since the first day, October 31st, 2003. Do not tell me you do not feel difficult.) But The biggest thing most likely in Oprah is Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a harasser. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has died since then. But this special presentation talked about Michael's personal life, something that not many people knew about at the time. <br /> <br /> The real opera effect comes from middle-aged women and football mothers. They seem to believe that they are like Jesus personal at times. But all I see in Oprah is a great ghetto lady who made them big and she only shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I am happy that their programs will soon be over. We need better TV programs.
