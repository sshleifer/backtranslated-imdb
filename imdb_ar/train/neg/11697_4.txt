I'm not one of those who think King is a wonderful writer. His books are good distractions for a few hours and often contain interesting places. However, they are, in my opinion, collapsing very quickly if you give them any serious thought. br /> <br /> This film suffers from a thorough recounting of the king's story. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes to the scenes or characters. This movie was designed by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is horror of the "Gypsy Curse," with its distortion being the curse of being something many people want to become thinner. The last third faces some severe structural problems, and the little coercive end seems to break slightly the rules of this kind. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you also read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
