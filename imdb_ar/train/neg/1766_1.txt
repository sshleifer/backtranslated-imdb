Baldwin has really bowed low to produce such films. The script and music and almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound FX does not look real, it goes a long way (technical tools, etc.) If you are trying to create a movie about things like this, try at least to become real with it and drop those extra whistles and whistles, because these tools Do not make sounds like this. Natural sounds like steps like this do not seem to exist, giving them a vacuum-like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The output seems good for such a low-budget film (I hope its production is low budget), although it seems somewhat amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem to be empty and wrong, but they simply did not film well. I imagine it would be better to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than to make Spanish speak English, when we all know that their language is the most vibrant language, and that is why actor performance can suffer greatly if a strange language is used. I mean, can anyone finally understand how stupid it seems to make international actors speak English in bad language? I must have a long buried body in film production. Production team ever heard of translation? This film once again depicts the European police as lazy and corrupt, weak and vulnerable communities. I mean if the plot is again like "The Interpol can not do the socket, so let's call one American to drop this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures lists the same path Colombia used to do, just to make movies for the hell out of it. I imagine them to have some self-esteem as well. Are buyers supposed to buy all dirty property just because Sony puts something good several times a year? Maybe they should have used the same team that made the dcc - say I do. Spoken in Spanish, Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a good job of keeping the film standing. Sounds and looks much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
