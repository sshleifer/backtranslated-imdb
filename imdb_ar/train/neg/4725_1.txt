A great opportunity for Indy to produce an interesting film about rock music on the edge of stardom. It would have been a good film if he had dealt with the battered past of John Levin and how he had tortured his psychology. Instead, it's a silly attempt to get to know John Levine's life with John Lennon. John Lenin was the hero of the suicide mother of John Levine, and she wished him to become as strong and abundant as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical intelligence and his wonderful ability to expose others to learning something about their own lives, this legacy of Lennon has shown him to be a troubled soul addicted to drugs, and should be seen as God instead of a man. I am a fan of John John Lennon, and this film reminded me of another "crazy" maniac of Plenon, Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man brutally murdered by another person suffering from an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to remember that? John Lennon has given much to the world with his music and sincerity. He has been repulsed by the sight of another troubled person, as the main character in this obsessed film, and does not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono generously honored the memory of John Lennon, by making a monument in Central Park to give his fans an opportunity to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this film chose to use this site to try suicide suicide. I found this annoying and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died with a senseless death, and felt that such violence near this site felt like a re-examination of a terrible wound to any Lennon fan. The movie has completely ruined for me. It could have been a good movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family lie in peace and not be reminded of the villain's murder through this irresponsible film.
