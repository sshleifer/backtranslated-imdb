How could such a terrible scenario attract this actor? This is ridiculous, predictable and totally unreasonable. It is well behaved and tacky, but the material is very bad and is still considered one of the worst thriller films I've seen in years. Surprisingly bad, not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
