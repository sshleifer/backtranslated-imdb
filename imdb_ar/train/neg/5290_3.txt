I'm not usually the one for the movie. I try to see good points and not focus on bad points, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you do something bad, why bother? Part of the film deals with footage of Anne's face as she breathes deeply, playing violin in the background. The other part is filled with poor representation and wood. Robert Benry Jones is the expression. Jennifer Higgam plays Anne's younger sister with modern behaviors. Anne is portrayed as a depositary and self-interested, which is good at first, but remains the same throughout the film, and sees no reason why Captain Winterworth fell in love with her. In general, production lacks any sense of time, with too many errors to be ignored, such as running out of concert, kissing on the street, and running down the street without a hat (why was this scene in the film at all? More romantic scenes written). To sum it up, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
