This can be one of the most fun movies ever if you do not take it seriously. Little dated and lame effects, but very enjoyable. There is a giant crab that attacks the girl. Oh, the crab sings Japanese. It's surprisingly bad. The result, that the telegraph was all over the entire film is gorgeous gorgeous. Predictable, but seeing the final battle will make you roll in your seat. Do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is pleasant to watch and yes, she looks naked. She does not deserve her daughter to bear the order, but she is under attack by the giant crab. They are big cat size. This is 2, but I love it. A sponsor, my God, but for entertainment, give it 7. Have you mentioned that there is a giant cancer?
