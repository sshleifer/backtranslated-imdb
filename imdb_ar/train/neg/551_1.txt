I've gone through AFI's Top 100 Comedy List, and I have to say that this is really one of the worst. Not only of the 90 films on the list that I have seen, but about any film I've ever seen. Dirty sometimes funny, Dudley is not. Lisa almost got to be worthwhile, but unfortunately ... Go see Arrested Development if you want to see her in a good thing. Seriously, Dudley is supposed to be laughing and drinking funny? I would highly recommend almost any other film on the 100 best comedy film at AFI for more laughter from this. If you want to see more fun, try The Thin Man. In general, any film from Marx Brothers will end (especially if you are drunk like Arthur).
