Frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is that? What about Will Smith who I can not stand for longer? I think it seems very serious to take it seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how this bias is, but unless I get some new acting classes I will never see him win. It is a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. it's not like that. I appreciate him for the hard work, the ability to cry when a hat falls. Thats all about it. <br /> <br /> It was seven pounds of the first type for me, from the start. The 911 suicide call was not interesting to me in any way. I did not feel curious to find out why he was calling in suicide. There were no surprises at all. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some chemistry on the screen. I do not know her name either, but the Hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a frightened wife and a racket. Woody Harrison had a very limited screen time, but I say he stole the show whenever he worked. <br /> <br /> All in all, just a series of non-original mills plot. I could not ask myself all the time why I was interested in any of these people. I never felt sorry for Tim / Ben. Kill himself with jellyfish? Was the only survivor in the accident of 8 people? Geewiz..didn't see any of that coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 Very generous.
