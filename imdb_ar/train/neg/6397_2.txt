This is a problem I have with movies that appear on TV, when there is nothing else to watch. I was amazed in one way or another in very bad films. <br /> <br /> But this movie was fairly famous. The concept of being the only one left on earth after a comet, then discovering the zombie around makes me laugh. That's why I gave this movie 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way make you laugh (stupid> very funny). <br /> <br /> I thought I saw it just because the guy from Star Trek was the lead. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... he was the only ridiculous character anyway.
