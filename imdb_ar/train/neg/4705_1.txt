My favorite memory of this show and band was when I met with a group of my friends who hated the NBB and they had a big torch and we took a CD of their songs and DVD movie and a bunch of pictures the band members threw them into the fire and danced a happy dance about the burning stuff while singing "Ding Dong Charming Dead "He said. This was the best thing in the show and this is a stupid offer with the god capitol that this offer sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of crappy car. You guys really suck! You've ruined the whole channel! No offense or anything but you guys need to have a life, I mean, really, who offers a stupid offer with a stupid master singer who can not even sing! You guys look really horrible and you need to get a life as a prospect or something, except Rosellina. she is really beautiful. But still you guys!
