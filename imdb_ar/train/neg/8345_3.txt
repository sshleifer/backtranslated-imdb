This film could have been much better, especially given the talent. Larnes Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lemon was not well done, especially in musical performances. It does not coincide well and his playful behavior patterns are Larnes Tate, when Frankie Lemon should have been. The portrayal of women as a bunch of gold diggers has written Hollywood everywhere. The powers that they obviously pushed out, but made the characters more realistic. The film's pros were Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard, and Little Richard himself. Lily Rochon eye candy, as usual, even in the role of wallets. It is very bad to miss the talent of Halle Berry and Vivica e Fox. The full story Frankie Lemon was fantastic in real life. Too bad this movie was a missed opportunity.
