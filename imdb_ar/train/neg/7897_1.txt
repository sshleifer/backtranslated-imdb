This movie was produced for people who found that Gremlins are very serious and very creature. Like many of the films of creatures / trolls / gems in the 1980s, this film is bad. The sad part is that there are no comments on this comment. It's bad and not funny. <br /> <br /> The problem with this mini-wild film is that it really tries to be funny and ends up being successful in doing it like Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other horror movies of the 1980s in the classics was that they were really trying to be scary, but they were joyful because they failed miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hersh (yes Bettina Hersh) that she had a talent for comedy before she started directing the film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Seeing a small, eccentric intersection between the nymphs and the tumor wearing a small brown coat and throwing billiard balls at the outcast of Lost Boys is certainly a feat, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing part of the film is Paul's character. Paul Reiser is your wannabe schtick enough to let you start a quick reorientation from the time you first show up until you stop the final credits just once to see a scene where munchie balls throw billiards at someone ... not that. <br /> <br /> So the basic jogging is run, do not walk, to the nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for the lack of grapes to store this trash heap on the shelves.
