I can hardly believe that this inert, violent and well-traveled film is from a film director who has enjoyed his other work. You left the experience of carrying your mother and your parents (and any other word but "permanent" will do), in a lousy mood, which is only relieved by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112. Not only did Romer successfully try to make us see the world through genre art in the 18th century in France, but as Ali pointed out (at the expense of alienating his audience) the effects of class consciousness and revolution inspired by the eyes of a disgruntled elite woman In her age. The director has done something undeniable, but I wonder if it's worth the effort he did to do it - or for us to see the dim results of his work.
