I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this film has no effect. Everything has a sense, a fake, and is equipped with a sound chain, with a really terrible rear screen projection. She has a good idea about the plot that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a script, making it impossible for the audience to indulge in work and really care about any of the characters. Pedestrian guidance only highlights how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I've seen a lot of "theater productions" quite enjoyable before, but this is not one of them. All you do is make you appreciate the more daring Scott / Boetticher films. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is dyed, shines, and shines a million dollar grin. He always makes me happy ... even in his worst films. Apart from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this film was the extent to which I enjoyed Wymore in Errol Flynn, Rocky Mountian. In "The Man Behind the Gun," she's just as beautiful, and you can say she's a good actress, but she had to say some pretty stupid lines, and the ban she gave the director was really awful. I've only seen Phil Curry in "The Pacific Process", and he plays the same character exactly here ... the overbearing pain you want to overcome in the subconscious. I think he proves to be a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic satisfaction that only detract from the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to be addressed, I must say that I found myself really enjoying Spanish songs that sung with musical numbers ... but that's not why we go to see Randolph Scott's films, right? <br /> <br /> Surely Scott's movies are worse, and this certainly is not possible, but he certainly can not be considered anything more than average.
