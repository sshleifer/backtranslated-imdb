I personally liked the "prophecy" of 1995 a lot. Christopher and Alken, as always, were wonderful, and although the film was not flawless, it was a very scary and fictional film that I enjoyed very much. The sequel to the bottom of 1998 is still worth seeing, but mainly due to Walken. In my opinion, Walken is considered one of the greatest actors in this area, and is again eminent in the role of Archangel Gabriel, who plays for the second time here. Once again, the war is brought between fallen angels and loyalists. Gabrielle returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, ie baby angel Daniel (Russell Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Bells). This child can be the decisive factor of the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Whelkin is again as excellent as Gabriel. Along with Gabriel, however, the "second prophecy" unfortunately includes a group of terribly disturbing personalities. Valerie's character was disturbing enough, and Daniel annoyed me more. But the biggest pain in the ass was the character of Ezzie (whose role was Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who would not shut up. However, Walken's performance is not the only quality to redeem the film's value. The whole film is very bleak, and is filmed in dark colors, which contributes heavily to the atmosphere. Moreover, the scene of the resurrection performed by Gabrielle at the beginning is impressive, and is one of the finest moments in any of the films "Prophecy". "The Prophecy II" is the weakest in the three films "Prophecy" with Walken. Certainly Christopher Wacken, one man, amusing, but nothing else.
