Milly is the sap. She marries a wealthy man named Maitland and they have a child. Then I realized that he was betraying her and releasing her ... but she allowed him to keep the child she claims to love. At the time, in the early 1930s, she had the right to get great support from the couple and the child, but she let the man out surprisingly ... without support ... what a move! Later, when she has her boyfriend and looks good life, also turns into a fool! Wow, you have a hard time choosing men. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie is changing. Now she is a girl in a wild concert - doing her best to distract her from her difficult luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Milly's daughter, who left early in the film, is now 17 years old, and fashion has not changed strangely. Now an old friend of Meles (yes, he is another evil man!) Pretends to be the daughter's friend, but he has terrible designs on her. Miley promised that if he touched the girl, he would kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is confusing and often strange - like "Madam X" but much less focused. Milli's motives often seem to be meaningless. The film seems to contain little of everything that has been thrown into it - as long as it supports the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good.
