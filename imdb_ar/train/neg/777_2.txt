I can not believe that such slanted material of the language of the language is passed on to the Americans as household art. Early, through lines such as "Want to make sure they're playing with the right team" and manipulative tires and lighting, A Love Divided shows that it's a real face. The wise way in which Irish Catholics appear to be dominant, and the Protestants as peaceful and persecuted, is a poor representation of history, such as the representation of the early American West that depicts the conflict between American cowboys and Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with stereotypes and explicit defamation of the Irish Catholics in the story; corruption recognized by the directors themselves! It is sad that people still think today that they are able to gain moral influence by making a film that is easily recognizable as a clear intention, away from trying art. This film has no activity anywhere in any cinema or legal library.
