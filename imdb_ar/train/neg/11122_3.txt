I'll say this a lot - this director is about RAW photos ... things most of us are not prepared to face to face. Sexual images, suicide, murder and people who "hide themselves" are constantly bombarding the scenes, making me wonder if the director is trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I do not think I could have seen this film again, I would say that the director has a good eye. There were some really nice shots and "moments of images" in the film (the fans and barbed fish in their hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly because we left asking ourselves "what did we do? <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily ... do not see this movie.
