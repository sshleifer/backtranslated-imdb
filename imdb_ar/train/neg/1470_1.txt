I was looking at our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were among the NetFlix correspondents and were a quiet Saturday night. I pulled one I had not heard before and realized she was borrowed from a friend. From the cover, it seemed like a big part of "The Big Chill", but with the stars cast, they felt it was worth watching. The boy was wrong !!! This was not the case with "The Big Chill", but was also an almost personal character. Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt ("Where I Was All This Time") - the spoiler's warning - and here he is, and still behind him to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Slutty Slut Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., and found myself wondering why I even watch these people. There was not enough evolution of personality to find any interest in it. How did "Unca Lou" find these characters after 20 years? Plus it was not funny, only when Perkins fell, he made a mistake "get out" from bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After she finished, I asked my wife, "Were there any favorite characters in this film? ... Do you sleep there?" "No, I'm still thinking ... No, there's nothing I can think of."
