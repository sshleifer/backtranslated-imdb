You are not being hired to rent this movie. Has nothing to do with the escape from the death penalty, despite the title (in English). I can not think of one good thing to say about the film. Bad representation, bad editing, bad direction ... funny "plot", sound / music were very annoying, it's no wonder that this movie does not come with a warning sticker. The only way to watch this movie and enjoy it is the historical quality of cheese. They just do not make films that bad anymore.
