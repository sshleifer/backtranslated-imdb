Well, first, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. I was loved by many fans. Now ... this film was not a movie at all. "The Crocodile Hunter" was a bad representation, bad text, bad direction between Steve Asser and the animal. He was amused as a student / animal specialist. Millions will miss him. But the idea of ​​the whole film was a big mistake. The plot was very broken and was almost present. The casting was terrible. Acting was not worthy of actors at the primary school level. The direction must also be defective. If you can not get decent performance halfway from your representative, no matter how bad the script, you should not be good in the first place. You've written a better script. I wish I had never visited this film. Of course, I saw that for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son.) While I was out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not discriminating, liked the film well, but never asked to see it again. If you want great memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like Plague. If you're Steve, I know I do not want to remember this movie. Respect him: Avoid this movie!
