There is nothing new here. All scenes are standard romantic comedy, even down to the taxi that is heading to the airport to prevent the woman from flying away. The only thing that saves this is the representation of Allison Eastwood and some of the little characters (Wolf and Sophotech Gabriel Anwar), who obviously enjoyed some fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple is in bliss, and you will not have to go through an inevitable conspiracy pain.
