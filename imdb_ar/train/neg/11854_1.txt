For my life I can not understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was useless. Matthew Modin was horribly terrible as a prominent female man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I will repeat it, why the stupid tone? Absolutely unnecessary. Her acting was just bad. I do not know if she has been given an accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> The girl was in love, suddenly she was pushing half a head of lettuce in her mouth and behaving in a hateful way? Where did this come from? I think we should have felt sorry for her because we saw her marriage to workaholics begin to collapse, but frankly, I did not care much about any of these people.
