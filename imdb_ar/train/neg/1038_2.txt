Raising Victor Vargas is just a bad film. There is no amount of propaganda or propaganda supported by the dollar to change this sad reality. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett may have seen that he did not have the money for the film he wanted to produce and decided to take the easy way by making a bad film that ridiculed the current "thriller" beliefs. Maybe he just does not know any better. It's hard to tell. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to tell the result. With the exception of a few viewers who will think of making bad films in an attempt at false realism, few will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know I did not. <br /> <br /> Prepare yourself and pass this movie.
