An interesting idea for the film, displays each of the last dragon on the ground and shows the conflict between him and a wicked person. When he was younger, Enon was stabbed in the heart, and Bowen (Dennis Quid) took him to the dark gentleman who gave him half his heart. The now grown Ein Einon (David Thewlis) is now a selfish and evil king. At the same time, Bowen uses a new friend, Draco the Dragon (which Sir Sean Connery expressed) to get rewards for "killing" dragons. But because Einon has half Draco's hearing, they feel that the pain in one of them has been injured or injured. He starred as Pitt Postaluit as Gilbert of Gluckspor, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aeslin, and John Gilgod as King Arthur. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. worth watching!
