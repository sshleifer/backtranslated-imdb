Overall, I do not do, if this site can give this movie -3 out of 10, it means I really hated this film. I thought that Uwe Boll alone in the dark was the worst I've ever seen, but at least I gave him 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorf, who shot at anything that made me laugh so I boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if compared to Bloudrayne, and Bloudrayn won the Academy Award for Best Film if they were competing. <br /> <br /> Now in the plot, this movie revolves around BTK killer which is good but they could have done better. It seemed to be fine, but this had to come mostly because death was boring. I love deadly films, and even if they suck, they can get some cold deaths. I'm not an expert in the cinema world, but believe me he would shoot himself if he saw it. Sorry for the theft but there is nothing good to say about it, because it seems that someone is taking a video camera and depicting this .. this is a disaster. Uwe Boll Your movies are no longer on the worst films list. <br /> <br /> Well, I could not explain the plot (if there was one movie) but that was the best I could. Now if you do not mind that I will crawl into a corner and go back and forth and remind me of the bad extent that this movie has scared me for life .... Well no lifetime
