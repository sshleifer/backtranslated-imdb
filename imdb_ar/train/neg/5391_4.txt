I really hate most end movies of the world. They show what Hollywood pessimists think of in the rest of the world, and clearly believe that we are a group of sadistic idiots (or at least seeing sadistic idiots reacting to things in a somewhat unconscionable way). I have visited L.A many times, and I have a family that works in the field of show business, and I just want to say that these are the * other * people we should be looking for to verify the reality. Some disaster films at least draw a clever picture: children of men, 12 of the monkeys, but usually the message is "people will do anything to survive, everything dark, sad and useless, we must all be ashamed of ourselves." <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like the idea of ​​a story that explores the elimination of the system of social system and test the ability of people to face horror, I think some people will act like this film photographed, but idiots sadly aside, I doubt the seriousness of society will melt only In every man for himself, this is just an insult.
