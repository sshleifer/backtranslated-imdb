I have just finished reading a book on Dillinger. This film was terribly inaccurate. They seem to have got a list of names and made everything. His robberies and burglaries were well planned, until the second - when the time was up, they left whether they got all the money or not. They had notes about each route, where they run, etc. He never saw him in the restaurant, he was told that Delinger paid for his meal after Delinger left. Borvis was never seen before Dillinger before Dillinger was killed, only his pictures. The way the gang members died was fake. Dillinger did not take away any bank alone, as he did in this film. If I had never read the book, I might have enjoyed it. The representation was slightly higher in places. The work was too exaggerated. In the second idea, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much even if I did not read the book.
