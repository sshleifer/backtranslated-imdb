Ah yez, Channel Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti hateful film. I was especially impressed by the scenes immediately following the accident, where survivors were desperately searching for matches, with at least half of the fires burned? For no apparent reason ?? At different points of debris. The fire seemed to be a constant theme all the time. They searched the bodies for lighters and matches, and finally found a box that appeared to be burning a day, apparently, for 12 people, but no one collected wood at all. Then when the plant burned the bodies, what was used for the accelerator? I mean these guys were frozen ?? Well maybe not. Although the temperature of everything is clear eat ytti, bleed. Maybe I'm just, but even in a totally incredible tale (never heard of any survivors ever, or a nasty snowman, to the end), if you take care of small things the bigger deals become acceptable. Oh, what is the relationship of Introduction (1972) with the rest of the film? The pistol freezes, warm enough to hold in his hand, so as not to shoot. Give me time to rest. Well, at least we have Carly Bop, another wonderful Canadian miracle. With little irony, Ed Marinaro as coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I might add, that the rabbit they eat (though it looks like chickens) is not a harlot, but Lagomorph. Now if it was a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been rodent, but it still looks like a chicken. The book has lost a real chance to get a note of someone "tasting like ..."
