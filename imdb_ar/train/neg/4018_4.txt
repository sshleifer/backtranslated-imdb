This movie is very skeletal. It's a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) It is somewhat excuseable, but the lack of decent actors and a painful scheme hurts it a lot. Phillips is very certified in his role as a torn son of a wealthy family looking for himself (although his family ... well, very small white ...), but the rest cast cast in hay. Every moment involves the potential of being destroyed by excessive melodrama, and there is a way too many sub plots (which are a clear sign of lack of conspiracy ... they do not recommend this film to anyone who is not a fan of the hardcore Phillips or has no Nothing at all. 10/04.
