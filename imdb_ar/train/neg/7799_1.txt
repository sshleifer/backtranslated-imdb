What in God's name happened here? How can one create what is practically a cheap knockoff from the Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 supposed to entertain someone ... anyone, or even make a profit? But mainly, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a madman named Andreas Schnaas, a specialist in ground-breaking gore films such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain profanity in the titles. In the section on injustice, this section is not very different from the rest. Although the level of inefficiency ... Well, smashing the earth. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is very bad like Dead-Alive for Peter Jackson, think about it. <br /> <br /> Getting very specific with the story will be a waste of time. Accident, including chemicals lead to the return of the dead, eat the living. The concept is not treated this way. Gore effects are all new, low. Just a nightmare of class Z. I can not tell if this is supposed to be originally funny, somehow, I doubt that English dubbing was very correct in the original, but strange things happened. Everything just reminds me of a film introduction to Troma, but it continues to be a hell of a lot longer. <br /> <br /> I saw only one film that was worse, The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Shinas is a real director, I highly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you do not have any criteria for what you're looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it pass all the time. But if all you need here is gore, you may be able to prepare this device. Other than that, there is no atmosphere, no, I mean no budget, no value for entertainment, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated on 7/5/09: After a few other scenes from Zombie '90, I've changed my heart, or I think I've got it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so just remember the harsh words, although extreme extreme still deserves only one star.
