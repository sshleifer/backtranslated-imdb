Imagine a woman alone at home for forty-five minutes in which nothing happens at all. Then continue this twice. Writing flat and lifeless, laugh jokes, misbehavior prevents you from paying attention to any of the characters, even when they fight wolf packs and are beaten by fools and brothers. Anyone ranked this movie higher than the two is not quite sane.
