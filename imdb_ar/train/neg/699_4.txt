It is probably one of the most fragile movies ever, acting badly and writing badly. <br /> <br /> The plot Five students staying behind during the holidays close the building, but someone has designs on them and begins to kill them out of one by one, the main suspect is the terrifying ground guard John Hummett played by Woody Roll, or can be One of the five characters. <br /> <br /> Acting is not too bad and not great either except for Daphne Zongya, who dies on the road very quickly and was supposed to be the main heroine, and the rest is completely dull, although the main hero Laura Lapinsky sometimes enjoys her charm and you feel sorry for her In the end. <br /> <br /> THE KILLS CAN NOT REALLY SEE WHY THEY BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE THEY ARE FRAUDED FANTASTICLY, AND ONE SHAPE BECAUSE TWO HALES IN THE FIRST AND THAT SHOULD BE FALSE BUT, Boiled alive and another alive alive. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not really an exciting trip that was much better
