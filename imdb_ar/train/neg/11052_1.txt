The Deadly Wake is the perfect film for film students ... to learn how to make a film! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... What did the crew spoil with this click? Music mix Worst editing Worst script Worst worst filming Worst filming Worst filming Filming worst props Worst lighting sets. Let's face it, if this "movie" is in high contrast black and white and silent ... it was still bad. All the scenes are dark (the so-called "black" ones), often beating the musical score on the squiggly dialog boxes, which was fine because no one ever spoke of two whole sentences without a long pause. Robot "evil" was a joy ... What was that? Jazz Dance? Oh ... I think he was supposed to be walking tactically or something. I'm sure it has raised fear in the hearts of poor editors. And how can you edit a lot of footage from the trash? Not possible garbage is rubbish, no matter how glued. How did anyone get this through daily newspapers? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I could not stand to watch more than 15 minutes, it was so bad ... but I saw everything (with lotsa breaks) just to see if he had any good parts in it at all. NOPE! nothing! <br /> <br /> An ideal example of how not to flick ... we must see every student a serious film !!!
