The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film to watch. Mysteriously ambiguous, it treats every shot like a work of art. You have the impression that each shot is designed and prepared with a degree of great care that limits mania. To reflect the progress made by the cinema since the production of the first films in the 19th century and the simulation of its construction, does the camera never move here? Regardless of the camp and colorful musical figures. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and hardly a word is spoken. This strange and effective device forces the public to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone, even when the story progresses at a snail-like pace, we feel overwhelmed. Unfortunately, to me at least, this indulgence begins to collapse somewhere near the hour mark. I began to feel as though the film was a challenge for me to continue to watch as it became more difficult over time so that the viewing process became just a battle of wills. <br /> <br /> If the content of this film was not sexual as it is it will undoubtedly be more ambiguous to the Western public. As is the case, there is an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual assault on an unconscious (or perhaps dead) woman so repugnant that, while he may speak volumes about the degradation of pornography for both men and women (users and users) The way he chooses to make his point of view to make it ineffective effectively. Of course, the worst and most exhilarating participants will seek the pornographic content available to take out this movie for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their finger on the fast forward button of the remote control. <br /> <br /> Despite all his problems, the film is definitely a resident, and the more you think about it, the more sense it has. Ironically, for a film in which a little happens, the viewer is likely to be rewarded proportionally by watching a second or even a third time. For me, however, once was enough?
