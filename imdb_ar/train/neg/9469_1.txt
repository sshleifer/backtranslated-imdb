Audrey, I know that you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory, but please do justice to his legacy and respond to his wishes. Dr. Suss refused to license his characters during his life for very good reason. We ask you to stop spending his stories, pictures, illusions and personalities. They are being confused by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will cling to these strange historical interpretations that will forever contaminate the loving warmth of the innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> It is really your property to do it as you please. I just listen to others' advice for a short time. Save the rest of Dr. thank you.
