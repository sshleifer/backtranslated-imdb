The only redemption was the small part of Larry Miller. It seems that the film was trying hard to be "something about Mary", but I did not like this film and still below those standards. The actor who plays Paul was wonderful, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her tough personality. James Brolin was wonderful, but Paul's father seemed to be trying hard to be the character of Randy Qued from National Lampoon's Vacation.
