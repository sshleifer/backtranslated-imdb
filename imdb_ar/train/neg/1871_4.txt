Despite the number of luxury productions and great costumes, this film is a must see. The mysterious murder conspiracy is merely a way of assembling musical numbers, but often leads to an astonishing stopover as well as a lack of participation. Although it is clear that there was a lot of money spent on it, the figures are poorly portrayed and poorly portrayed. It's obviously a pre-programmed movie because girls often wear very little clothes and even a song praises marijuana! All performances are unique although it is good to see Carl Bresson in a musical, but when Victor McAllen, as police lieutenant, triumphs in the horizon for the first time in search of clues, you may want to throw the fastest towel forward to the next number . I pity the sponsors who were trapped in the cinema when it was released!
