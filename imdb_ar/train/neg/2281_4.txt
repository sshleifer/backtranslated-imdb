Think "play". This is worth seeing once for the shows of Lionel Atwell and Dwight Frey. Compare Two Douglas in "The Ghost Story" with the movie "Melvin Douglas" for this film. Are there vampires in this "Bavarian" village, or is there a more natural, though equally wicked, explanation? Dwight Fry is Herman, a red herring, represented as a special moron figure. It's fun to look at his different facial expressions in a truly personal picture. Not much happens for a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's smoking doctor is the real killer. There is a lot of "comic satisfaction" but that is the case for the cycle of this age. Faye Ray looks really good.
