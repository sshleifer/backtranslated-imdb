Before watching this movie, I could say that it was a complete copy of the saw (complete with the hut-like place where they were and the black man who wanted to break one's hand out of the cuffs). The name of MJH in a movie usually leads to the exclusion (ah, can we tell you GROSS?!), But I still want to try it. <br /> <br /> I started, I was a bit interested. The acting was very terrible and I found myself laughing almost out of every reaction from the characters (especially the guy who played "Sulley"). MJH was the worst, but I kept watching. <br /> <br /> However, the end was the biggest joke for all of them! I sat down seriously in the sudden thought "Was it the end?" Is this a comedy? <br /> <br /> I thought this pile of nonsense was more fun than a spoof for a "scary movie" and that's something that really says!
