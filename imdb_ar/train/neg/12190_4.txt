One of the worst scorsese. An exciting story The only thing I recommend is playing De Niro Psychic. The end is usually of this kind, such as over-the-top, with another almost invincible villain, immune to pain. I did not like the original 60s, and this version was not much improved on it. I have no idea why Scorsese is wasting his time on a remake. Then again, taking into account how bad his modern films (referring to his blunt Buddhist film and all the films with his favorite new actor, blond girl DiCaprio), this is not bad compared. Considering Spielberg wanted to do a remake ... he could have been much worse.
