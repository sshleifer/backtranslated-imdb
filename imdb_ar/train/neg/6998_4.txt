Hollywood has always faced a problem in reaching a "religious image". Foreign charging proves that it is no exception. Despite taking advantage of the fantastic talents of the group, and their production on a high budget, with a favorable mood portrayal by Robert Blanc, the film failed frighteningly to a degree of credibility. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of elements of fiction disturbs the participation of the viewer in the event and the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit idly by through all the impossible metaphors, references and biblical references, and it is impossible to know Ian Hunter as pampered and amazing as the character of Christ. The censorship was approved in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least. Movie blocked. Few Boston / Detroit / Providence pioneers, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was clear from the track that Gibbel and Crawford had somehow participated in a "picture message". I stumbled everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the film has enjoyed some recovery on television. The atmosphere of the house seems to make the film's story more receptive to viewers. Yet, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the conspiracy of these exotic goods flows through highly predictable ethical lines and no one will guess how the main characters reconcile with fate in the end.
