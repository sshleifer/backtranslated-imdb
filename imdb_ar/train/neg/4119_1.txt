Thank God I did not go to the cinema in this film. I will be very sorry for the money you made. I saw him on TV and could not believe my eyes. I wonder if any film could be worse than this movie. They spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. Horrible scenario and terrible representation. I think the other people who wrote the comments are the guy who works from that film company;) It's a very big failure! In 2000, do you still laugh at this kind of movies? Embarrassing ...
