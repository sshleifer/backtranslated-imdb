The address must be the walkway. The man spends 90% of the movie walk. He does not know what he wants, or what he is. Passing life is stealing people's identity for nothing. Not getting any benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be someone else. <br /> <br /> No one could understand why he pretended to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear in this film is that he loved his father and was a good son. But the rest was nonsense. <br /> <br /> The director may be the loser who wants to be someone else. But what he really has to do is get a real job, because after his film, I do not think he has a chance to create a film producer.
