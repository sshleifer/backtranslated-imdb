I admit that the majority of this film was not inspiring, but I was still enjoying it. She has a wonderful sense of frantic energy, above normal music, and the women in the film are fiercely defending themselves, there are no presices here. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this film had an impressive scheme along with some social commentary. They hint at how the army is dealing with viral epidemics, destroying everything on the horizon, even if it means people who are supposed to be rescued. Also, how serious are martial law because democracy at that stage no longer exists. Folsi seemed to be trying to combine his former work (coma, behind them, the gates of hell) in an attempt to improve them somehow. It has failed, but certainly not a terrible failure, like the number of people you might think. For zombie movies, so I admit that I am somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I'm saying is that this movie is good for once, if there is not a lot of downtime in making this movie (resigned from Folsi and Bruno (I can break in with their best) Mattie took over) could have been better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as the zombie swan song from Folsi. There is an amazing observation. Scene 3 In zombie 3 the cemetery man has already broken it, I could not believe it myself, make sure you will be surprised.
