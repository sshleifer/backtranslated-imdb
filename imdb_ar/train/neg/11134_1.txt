This is a wolf flick very cheap. The video is dark and has poor lighting. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a vulgar junk with usual characters like the hard detective who shoots the wolves from his silvery pistol! [Full of silver shot course]. Representation of wooden figures like. FX is non-existent, and a lot of extreme close-ups of the wasps and biting. The only thing that shows is a lot of T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this trip, check out a very wonderful funny image recently: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
