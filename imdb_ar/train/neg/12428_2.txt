I loved the first two films, but this was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they made this terrible film. The thing that the plastic pistol carries with the toy car that can enter another house is ridiculous. Joe Bisky and Daniel Stern were in the first two very funny films, but the terrorists in this film are very stupid and not funny. Believe me this movie is just a waste of time.
