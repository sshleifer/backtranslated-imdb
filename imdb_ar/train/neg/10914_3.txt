Would not it be a joy when it suddenly happens in a disgusting world that leads to a pathetic life, turns his life upside down and causes him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula does not become old, is it? It's a surefire way to make a classic movie! See only highlights like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must be the line of thinking Rob Schneider when he achieved almost successful success with Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and his follow-up with The Animal. Since I have already traced the plot through irony, let me paint it even more: Sneijder plays a lost policeman who was suddenly involved in a tragic accident but was rescued through surgery ... by a vet who loads him with parts of the animals, making him yell as a horse in Inappropriate times, running like a leopard, etc. This film is a little more popular than the other clicks that Schneider starred (like The Hot Chick), but they almost seem to want the public to hate it by choosing a realistic TV star as a romantic leader (Colin Haskell from Survivor) Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing good memorable except for the production value. I just want to end this review by saying that simple references to other films in the film can be fine, but when it comes to lines that are delivered exactly the same way ("You can do that!"), There is a word for it - "Aleppo." In fact, here's another word - "cheap".
