Although the plot was very well detailed, and the line of the story was understandable, the voice of Steven Seagals was called someone else during most of the film was sad because you are not sure who is speaking. There were many parts where he would begin to speak in a deep rude voice, and then someone else was talking for him. However, I do not know why if he had difficulty in his voice during the production of the film, I think it was possible to re-portray events that did not contain his voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When one pays for a movie whether it is in the theater or on DVD or not, this movie does not deserve the admission price that was uploaded. I have been Steven Seagal's followers for a long time and all his films have been done over the past years. So far I think this is one of the worst movies we've seen so far
