This is the first time I write a comment on a film on IMDb. But I had to write for this one. In 3 hours of relentless torture. From the start, you get the idea that the movie will become bad. The representation is pathetic. I am a fan of Ajay Devgan (I love him in Bhagat Singh) but he is in his worst condition in this film. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but fear is still missing. Brashant Raj is not represented. The most irritating part of the film is Nisha Kothari. I have no idea why she took her to the director in this film. The background score is repeated. I felt somehow that Ramo tried to replicate Sarkar, the subject of color, the degree of background, the angles of the camera, but he did not succeed. Please do not see this
