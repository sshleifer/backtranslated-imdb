This film could have been 15 minutes long if it was not all this bickering between father and father. Highly predictable. Both male "stars" need a good slap in the face! Do you want some cheese with whine? A chuckle ... and a headache. I can understand why the mother left Baalha after 47 years ... I do not know how long this lasted! The first 5 minutes made me want to stop the movie, wishing I had not paid $ 3.99 to watch it! The film did not flow well and was painfully long. I kept watching my watch in the hope that the time would fly faster ... it did not happen. The text had so much repetition that it was easy for the writer to fill the space. On the plus side ... the scene was beautiful, the fall is my favorite season. The car, the Ford 40 was also very nice. This movie gets a rating of D approaching F
