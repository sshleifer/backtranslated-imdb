I'm not sure which Hong Kong movies that other reviewers were watching, but Enter the Eagles is not anywhere near the top of the HK movement. Michael "Fitz" Wong must be happy because he is able to get acting jobs in Hong Kong, because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a great fighter (even with better leg fighting than her father), but her acting skills are also uneven. In fact, every English dialog box (90% of the movie - more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin only to save myself from the misery of delivering bad dialogue and repeating English submarines. Sure, there are some decent battles (but nothing we have not seen before) and good cinematography, but the visual effects of cheese actually spoil the movement. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth the price of admitting that Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Orchids go to it. Amazing, worth watching the rest of the movie almost. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some scenes that look "familiar" to you, especially shoot in the outdoor market (Think of the Matrix) and dive the Fitz from a helicopter wearing black clothes (think MI: 2) . I think someone thought that at least some of the things in this click were worth ripping.
