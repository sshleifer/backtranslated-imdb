I first saw this film when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it from local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. I thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This film, though, is afraid of hell. You may ask yourself, how can a film about Santa Claus frighten anyone? The movie revolves around the devil as he sends one of his followers, the pitch, to the ground in an attempt to kill Santa and destroy Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon out of hell to kill Santa Claus. Santa stalks the playground throughout Christmas Eve trying to blow him to the ground when the sun shines on Christmas Day, because if Santa does not return home in space, it turns into powder. Do not get me wrong, the film is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and demons that dance in the depths of Hell (occurring at the beginning of the film) is just completely creepy.
