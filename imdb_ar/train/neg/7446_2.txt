I have two words for you. Sean Bean. Is the only meaningful presence in this film. But still, you do not see this movie. Although it is as good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except for the little boy). In fact, I did not really care if they ended up star lovers or died. The film did not make me care or think these people cared about each other at all. I have read many "classic" novels after watching movies and this film made me not want to read the book. The story looks very boring. But I went ahead and read it to try to retrieve the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Down. The actress who played the role of Lorna was also in mind and passion and was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower and A & E have great films from novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries such as Forsyte Saga. Check it out, do not bother with Doone Lorna.
