... but they are certainly not without merit. Writer and director Preston Storges is already experimenting with extraordinary cinematic influences in his storytelling, creating distinctive and distinctive characters and attitudes, writing intelligent dialogue and sometimes unexpectedly and graciously. (No wonder the next Coen Brothers movie is a tribute to the Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the plot is not along the way yet; it lacks surprise, unexpected changes in the plot and sudden changes in wealth Make viewers guess. The coffee motto is lousy to hang up the plot, and the end is quite predictable. Frank Capra does a better job of this kind. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.
