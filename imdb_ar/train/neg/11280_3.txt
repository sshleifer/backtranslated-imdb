This film revolves around the man's life mistake. His work failed, and he could not inculcate his wife despite multiple attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a complete mess. Simply meaningless. In fact, nothing in the film is logical. The story is so bad that I simply could not understand it. It is shameful, because collections and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulated enough. The shots are well formed throughout the film. However, these recovery features still do not compensate for bad plot and bad storytelling. I am surprised by the large names that agreed to compose this film. This is a waste of their talents. This movie is too bad to avoid !!
