A wonderful book about the fox and his family do what the fox does. That the theft of farms and the killing of prey. So three farmers decide they have received enough of this fox and are trying in different ways to solve the problem. They of course "got out of the fox" at every turn, and while the trio was hiding in the foxhole, the family raided the land of the three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "film" version, I use the film term is very loose, is more than God awful pastiche of the theft of American films and especially ocean movies. They even have George Clooney like Mr. Fox to add insult to injury and they can miss the whole point of the story. So, they will earn a lot of money and destroy Ronald Dal's other classic children's book.
