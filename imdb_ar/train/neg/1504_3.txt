I am a big fan of Spaghetti Western type, and I usually also love most cheap price types. The notorious director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and also, the worst contributions in this genre. Vidani's plots were usually very weak, and since his talent was very limited, he usually tried to sell films by adding Western appetite names such as Dango from Sartana to titles. I am the case of "Gi La La Testa ... Hombre" in 1971, and just got the title "Gi La La Testa" from Sergio Lyon (aka "Duck You Sucker") and added "Hombre". The film can be found under different titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I personally purchased it under the name "Adios Companeros", which is shared with another Fidani with almost the same cast, "Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari ", also known as" Adios Companeros "in the German version. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, essentially followed by a man called Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) sharing with two outlaw gangs led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Bates) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> The leading performance of Jeff Cameron is, gently, not very convincing. I did not find Jack Bates very well like Butch Cassidy. But the legend of B-Gordon Mitchell is always worth trying, and although he may not have been a very good actor, I have always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns funny and innovative, and has already saved some Fidani movies (like crappy "Django And Sartana ... Confrontation in the West "). <br /> <br /> There is something very funny and innovative about "Gi La La Testa ... Hombre" - Great Klaus Kinski plays Priest! I could imagine Kinski in any role, but before watching this film, I never imagined that anyone would portray him as a priest. Kinski, again, is wonderful, although he has little screen time, and is likely to be one scene, where he breaks a fight, is the only good scene in this area. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and corrupt king Joe Damato have filmed the cinema. <br /> <br /> "Gi La La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap and majestic movie, but with it, it has some funny moments. Being a fan of Spaghetti Western Spaghetti, I found it interesting to watch, but if you are not, do not mind watching this movie or watching it just to see Kinski playing as a priest. 10/03
