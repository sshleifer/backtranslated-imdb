Manoj Agrawal returned after PARDESI BABU (1998) failed with this film <br /> <br /> The film contains Govinda in 8-9 roles, as his father, grandmother, grandmother and sister later on have camouflaged too <br /> <br /> He In short, he is a useless investigator sent by his friend in a case to obtain evidence against his wife, who loses her at the airport while courting Rani <br /> <br /> disguised as Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl. The fun part is how to do it easily and in a short time? <br /> <br /> Then he masquerades as a French singer, enters a television set for comic evidence and then, like Maharashtraine (yes inside the TV itself). <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same false identities and ends in a predictable tone. There are some funny scenes like Govinda being beaten by an african and also many other parts <br /> <br /> The output by Manoj Agrawal is fine. Music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda has once again proved to be one of the most fun actors. As usual, he likes to play such roles before he fits all the acquisitions and roles very well here again, although the roles that do not exceed 6-7 roles do not really fit in the film, Rani looks fat, and works well with Govinda Theats. There is nothing wonderful and has continued to do such kind of roles. Between comfort. Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johnny Lever is sometimes loud and funny in places in one role and harasses like an older Tino Anand is okay. Satish Kushik Farhan, Parish is fine
