As a child, the first installment (The Little Mermaid) was my favorite film. She was full of wonderful characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so later I watched this movie for the first time. I think this film was like most of the sequences and did not outshine its original image. I think I feel that way maybe because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it is not a bad film. <br /> <br /> When Ariel just gives birth to a beautiful child, Melody begins. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (sister of Urslas), so they build a large wall around their house on the sea. When Melody grew up, she began to wonder outside the walls where she was forbidden to go. The problem is a problem as Morgana tries to control the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to let go of any movie until you have to watch it. I loved that the sounds are the same and singing again is fantastic. I think this is a good family movie though it is overall!
