All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what films are made about. If you insist on producing movies about gangsters, I urge you to do research. It's fun to watch movies with ridiculous gangsters who seem more silly when they talk. <br /> <br /> I laughed from the part when Mr. Cahill went to a school with just 3 students and began to kick their heels in the fashion kung fu. This film was harsh after the private school. Who had the idea to wear hats that say where was a certain gangster? I think the real gangsters do not wear hats that claim a gang. This would be stupid when looking at new laws that add time to jail if someone is connected to a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever.
