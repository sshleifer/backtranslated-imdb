I found the characters modest and the story monotonous. I never had to read this book (fortunately), or it was a painful experience. I got the tickets for free preview but still not worth my time or my friend. I think this story does not deserve the novel. It's like saying that older people have a past before they grow up (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, and no generation was better than the next generation in avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did their best through a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstein. I write this review to face the positive reviews presented, which unfortunately convinced me the experience of this film.
