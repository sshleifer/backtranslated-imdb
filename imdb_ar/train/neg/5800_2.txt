As a fan of horror films, I try to watch all the important developments of this kind, especially those that are my film products. I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as a Russian punk) is one of the weakest films among them. First, can not scare even a small child, walking so slowly and unpredictably that there is no place for real horror. Frankly, it's bad at all points: the stupid plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian magic into lame and ridiculous in modern America.) I fully agree with the previous reviewer? Terrible. All the actors, including Valery Nikolaev and Yevgenia Kryukova, who are famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that. It seems to me that they did not bother to play at all, and only spoke about their English lines without any expression. In the end, I do not really understand why they do this in English with Russian actors? I think their role was wrong. At least some American or English actors can cast leading parts to make them seem more convincing. The same thing I can say about the so-called "backgrounds of small American cities" filmed in Estonia and look like they are. The only positive moment I found in Fear Force is visual effects. It is not excellent but somewhat good for Russian film. The music is fine, at least it does not bother me. That's why I give him two stars. Overall, if you want to see a good horror film? Do not waste your time and money on this tedious flick. If you're looking for something that claims to be Russian horror, I recommend you find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It is really a wonderful film based on the same novel "The Power of Fear" but much better.
