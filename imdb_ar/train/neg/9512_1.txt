I can not believe it was the worst film I've ever seen. I laughed several times. (Probably because of stupidity was) if someone pushed me to see this movie again would not. The plot was so terrible, it made no sense, and the acting was so bad that I could not even figure out if they were trying. This movie was a terrible rating: F
