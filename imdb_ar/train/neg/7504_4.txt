I am afraid to disagree with the majority. I found the latest spike me a bit boring wii! Although he was trying something different, which not only documented the rise and fall of serial killer, I do not think it worked well. <br /> <br /> Much of what is already happening - Fini (John) is related to Leguizamo, Dionna (Mira Sorvino), Adrien Brody's lifestyle and then local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end this is all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, can not Mr. Lee put more on this side of the film? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points though. All the scenes with the murderer of "son of Sam" David Berkowitz look very nice (color saturation etc ...) and very good acting all the time. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt that different stories would work well on their own or else without killing. They were not strong enough in the end. <br /> <br />
