Although there are many familiar "TV" names associated with "a man called a sledge," there is nothing unusual about the film itself or about any of the shows. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes her from the television series in the 1960s and 1970s, like The Rat Patrol, is a larger and more violent group. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and thinks he should try to keep away from all the light comedy stuff he has done ("Maverick", "Supporting Your Local Sheriff" - "Fighter", etc.). Unfortunately, his earthiness works against him, since Sledge's character has no soul written to take advantage of the popularity of Westwood's western character. But these Eastwood things were not flat and not helpful. <br /> <br /> I suppose a "sledgeman" could be classified as Western macaroni although the speed was too slow to fit that subtype. Fans of the slow-motion "Combat" television series will feel instantly connected with Vic Morrow directing the film and co-writing the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some slow modern shots and cross-melting, which draw attention to itself rather than serve the purpose of telling stories. <br /> <br /> The plot is the main thing "big theft" (Enter "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge planning how to increase the shipment worth $ 300,000. His group includes Claude Akins and Denis Weaver. The problem is that on the move, the shipment guards 40 of the outsiders, while being stopped in a cellar inside the regional prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story will make a good TV clock but it gets old very quickly as a very long feature film. Garner does not allow any of his magic to leak to his character and does not generate enough suspense film to interest the viewer. <br /> <br /> Finally hangs and burns the thing shortly after the gang steal the card game is contrived and completely illogical. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
