I saw "Mira Breckenridge" when she first appeared in 1970. I was twenty years old at the time and he liked movies and I really liked Raquel Welch. Moreover, I had read Gore Vidal's novel on which she was based and I think she was very funny. I saw the movie in a local car, and almost halfway through it, I felt a great temptation to run my engine until I died of the first oxide poisoning and I did not have to see the rest of the wreckage of the movie ship. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was tough and dirty. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Mae West was one of the worst choices in film history. As one critic said here, her role has nothing to do with the film or the book. Her character in the book was sexually beaten by a young lover, which would never do to the legendary West Lady. Oh no, the plot has been changed so that it sexually overtook him, and a very 77-year-old woman who looks like her every day is very true. Can continue, but why? It was a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Pluto
