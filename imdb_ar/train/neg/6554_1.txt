I will not give this film an assessment, it is not worth it. I saw it only because I admire Pevere. I love her and see anything I've made. Even in this beating, I did not disappoint. In every scene inside, I kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen but nothing happened at all. She had some good story lines but ended abruptly once she started. Some other characters had potential but none of them became. <br /> <br /> Beaver was 29 years old when she made this film and in its most beautiful form. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can not see anything very often and rarely see a film I can not find something I like, but it was meaningless. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about all, was having a great cliff connection in the end. His scene ends up awaking you and I say Wow, this movie finally goes somewhere, then credit balances. Good grief. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review she said .99 You could buy 3 packs of cat food and watching my cat eat was more exciting. well said. In fact, this comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up well. I wasted very .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
