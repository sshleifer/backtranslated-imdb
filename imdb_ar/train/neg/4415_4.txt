I have always said that some plays by their nature can not be translated into a film, and this is a wonderful example. <br /> <br /> As a theater, this is a very funny satirical satire of church Catholics, with its barbed wit and central character that is shockingly unrealistic, we have to justify it even when it begins to kill the sons of its diocese (one of them committed the fatal mistake of confessing That he has not made a mistake since his last confession, so she feels she is sending him directly to heaven). <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how the play goes about reality, and in making the theater world safe, it works. However, this type of high-end reality rarely works on film, and certainly does not work here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Breckman has assembled excellent actors who do a great job, but by making all this absurdity realistically, comedy is designed to become a tragedy and you are left with a feeling of emptiness in the pit of your stomach. <br /> <br /> Discover the production of a play play instead, you will not be disappointed.
