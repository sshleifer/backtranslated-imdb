This movie is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not mean that in a good way. We wanted to see a strange scare / terror, so we chose the horror that seemed to be the most wonderful in the store. For once, the film was all we expected. And more! (Or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to read their lines from stickers behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing the transparent red plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see through the eyes of deadly mice. The scenario? Do not let me start with the script ... and only when I thought it could not get worse, it turned out that the first part of the film was an Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you are in horror movies, but if you want a good movie, continue to follow. it is not yours.
