No one, but no one, can chew the scene like the first divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and Elizabeth and Essex are a wonderful example of it. Although she sometimes overcame the role, she watched her marvel at Raleigh's writing of the song that the ladies were about to wait for: at that moment, she made us understand how Elizabeth was capable of absolute judgment and judgment! At other times, it was done through script fineness. When Elizabeth must be at risk, she becomes weak and rude. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when its stack bursts and threatens justice, it is difficult to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes enchantment, and makes us see how Essex managed to eliminate his power the way to Elizabeth's heart, but he is utterly incompetent in conveying the complexity and wicked evil of man. It also does not help ensure a good IPO in Essex. Why is this reckless who wants to overthrow his kingdom - even when he divides her sincerity - but he is more bloody, and therefore, "deserves" more judgment? Why did Raleigh betray Elizabeth by intercepting Essex messages? He is not at risk of falling in our favor, and we know where Essex is headed (and his head). So why risk his head by accelerating the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Cortez do with every $ $ he gave him? He does not even bother trying to hide the fact that scenes of his fight have been launched on an acoustic stage. She had to end up with Elizabeth the first time alone in the tower; everything else followed (especially the last scene between her and Essex) was not necessary. Wonderful fashion. Do I, or do you look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
