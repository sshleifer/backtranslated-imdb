they ?? I agree with the reviewer who said that "strange people with generous tastes are reviewing this film." I thought the film was interesting to watch it. I think the reason for this is mainly due to Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is somewhat emotionally irritating on the one hand, and it is deeply gay on the other. Excellent on the former and triple-thumb on the latter. I'm not sure if the purpose of the film is to encourage dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the representation was average. Lots of conversation that was about 90 degrees deviant from reality. I wanted to draw some meaning from the plot, but in the end it was just a conversation with a crazy man (Speedman). I feel very sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. Its loss is not greater and certainly less than the losses suffered every day around the world for more important reasons. <br /> <br /> Does the film reveal naivet√© about HIV / AIDS? Yes: target audience. Is HIV a dark and mysterious killer? What about its victims? The answer to both questions is no. Neither HIV nor its victims have any more or less malicious intent on lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer or its victims, for GOD'S SAKE. Just because the disease is contagious does not make it deliberate or negligent - or evil - it is just. <br /> <br /> Is this an excuse for ignorance or risk seriously? - No. Do all people have to have safe sex? - Yes really. Is Safe Sex Saving the World? - No. Is sex safe in all situations of love and lust among passionate and passionate humans? ?? of course not. What kind of world do we live in if everyone follows the rules, no one ever risked, sex was not automatically and emotionally ??? Am I ignoring that the film deals with homosexuality exactly? ?? Yes really. HIV is spread through the exchange of blood or body fluids between infected and non-infected individuals. Sex is not necessary for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by deliberate violence from person to person. In fact I thought the film did a good job of portraying Tom's hidden absurdity, violence and intent toward Dan, and that kind of crazy violence happens every day. <br /> <br /> Diary Awareness Movie: Crazy Tom. <br /> <br /> Why does Dan not ask "why" you feel this way, rather than "what to do"? Embedding: Men who have sex with men get "AIDS" Embedding: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility to have sex? Why was it Dan's responsibility to use a condom? "Maybe you slipped him before you stumbled?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth" Are you kidding me "She's in the sky and I'm incredibly hurt about what you know now about me" ???? Has Dan's life ended if he is infected with HIV? of course no! Is this why the whole world is like me too? Believe that gay men are the cause of HIV, they will give it to the rest of the world, will we all die? are you kidding me??? Are people really stupid enough to believe that homosexuality is the reason ... is the problem ??? Do we feel this way towards TB victims? Malaria? I can see that Tom has been injured because of his wife's death, and that he blames her for AIDS, but seriously? Who is wrong here? Victim or virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of patients? (Assuming they did not seek or seek to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Sure, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but not so driving and not flying and not leaving home, not living. Do we really want to blame the victims? Have you banned safe sex between Tom and Dan's wife Tom's final death? Perhaps, but Dan's responsibility is not alone. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did you mention that. <br /> <br /> Tom Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? Come on! 24 days: violent, naive and gay. <br /> <br /> Do I exaggerate my reaction? Probably. But I think this film is pointing the finger at gay men because of their reckless and malicious intentions towards a "straight world" through unprotected sex, when the rate of homosexuals who practice safe sex is relatively equal or better than the rate of gay men. We all need to wake up and seriously about HIV / AIDS. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of straight Africans each year.
