Karl Panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled his memoirs on scraps of paper, perhaps the only one who did nothing for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James or Long, who released the best part of the century after the death of Panzeram, gives the historical context of the accounts of the first generation of Americans about escaping from the house to go to the West and be Cowboys, falling, throwing in the boy's house, and repeatedly running and throwing in prison again and again throughout Time to torture and sodomy. When Panzram grew large and strong, he sought revenge for the mistake he made while traveling to South America, Europe and Africa. It did not matter what people raped, robbed or killed him because we were all equally worthless. <br /> <br /> This film depicts the thin James Woods as the tough neck, the average ass, the son of a bitch Carl Panzram who in the film is "drunk", overly dramatic and emotional, who never mentions the joy of sodomy men and boys . The film does not address anything else, especially with regard to this global traveler and career prisoner (such as the theft of former President Taft or his release from Oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return). In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.
