Now I do not hate cheap movies. I do not see why you should waste any money for a movie you can shoot using your father's video camera. If you rent a movie, I want to have a movie, not a group of people who think it would be good to waste some MiniDV-tapes. <br /> <br /> I might hate this movie a lot because a man at the video store said it was wonderful, and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, it has the dumbest plot at all, the most unrealistic characters ever, and really worse, really, really in the history of movies at all. Even Tom Savini can not save this. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
