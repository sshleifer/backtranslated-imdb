After an initial release of four very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to get rid of the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. The mysterious number calls several actresses to his castle for a small holiday. After some subtle sex tricks, the girls become head-to-head. Who is the killer? Who do you know? There is more redfish in this type of local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is slow. The story is silly and the skin scenes are not all that great either. <br /> <br /> Give this person a miss.
