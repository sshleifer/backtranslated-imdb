I only give 3 stars for beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... well boring. For about 50 minutes, we have plot plot ... In the war of the worlds, primer, oh, about 10 minutes? Then it was real work! This is something like: "Let's walk in the Savannah and pant at the beautiful sunset!" He may have reached a message, such as "Do not kill elephants!" Very eco-friendly. I was expecting this from the film "New" by Steven Segal, and not from this ... Leading actress makes me think of artificial sun, dyed hair and too many foundation! I did not see one scene where her hair was stained or sweated or her clothes were dusty. She just does not look like a 19th century woman! In the bar, where they are looking for our hero, Suezi offers a commentary on the Dracula-like leader. Hmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became famous in the years to come. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the procedure takes place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze gives a great impression .. In short - hard from the outside, but soft and loved from the inside. I do not like to embrace with walnuts, but you get the point. He is really capable of taking a puppy look at his face on several occasions. The Movie Stank. Very long and increasingly tedious. Do not see it! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
