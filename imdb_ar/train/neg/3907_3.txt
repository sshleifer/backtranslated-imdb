I'm glad I hired this movie for one reason: its flaws made me want to read Allendy's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: The film is beautiful, and the period was well portrayed and consistent (as far as I know), and Merrill and Glenn are doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: This is the worst job I've ever seen in my life by Jeremy Irons - I kept wondering if there was a mistake in his mouth. (And I hate the awful English way he says "Transito"). Winona Rider does nothing believable unless he looks young and ideal. Most of the other shows are fine, but little things intertwine with each other in the characters' arcs and the evolution of the relationship that I felt frustrated and angry before the end. <br /> <br /> I'm curious now whether this film is typical of Bille August's work. I had to drop another couple of dollars to hire Smilla's Sense of Snow.
