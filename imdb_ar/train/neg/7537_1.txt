I think The Beach was bad, with the difference that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the terrible scenario, if anyone can understand anything the hell, give yourself a bet on the back. In the intersection between the "village" and a cinematic line. It starts to be somewhat interesting, and then with the passage of time in the plot, it makes no sense, and does not make me finally start !!! what was that? The only thing that makes this film is the existence of Nicolas Cage's usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the strangest cases. If you go to a famous movie, this is the only movie you have to watch, save yourself five dollars and promise to go home and get a little lost, and when some ask why, just say the stupidest thing that comes to your mind, and there you go!
