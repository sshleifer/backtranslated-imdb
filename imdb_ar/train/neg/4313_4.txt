Like last year, I could not sit at all. Well, Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was mysteriously engaged. Or rather, among all the boredom filled in the theater, was not at least the best 10 boring. On the other hand, many of the providers were among the top 10 people. I did not know that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was written), but it was so bad to see these performances that supposedly good actors were unable to insert the expression, look away from the signs and stumble simple words (Natalie Portman? If there is no way out, I have gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and long boring speeches were tedious, and Beyonce Knowles cut off some good songs and there were very few speeches and proper admission clips. Adam Sandler Wins Worst Presenter Award. <br /> <br /> To help me write this review, I would like to thank my mom, dad, lawyer and ethicist for everything I believe in. I would like to point out that I have a high rate of metabolism and of course I have not been starving for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
