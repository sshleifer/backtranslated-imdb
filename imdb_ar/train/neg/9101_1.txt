This movie was like "Disney Channel after dark". Get the language and themes "We're not fun" and you'll be left with the dialogue and conspiracy tools that insult the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "saved by the bell" as a high-quality television. This vulgar and vulgar dialogue is intentional, one might think that the scenario was the product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Aztiras in a room with orders to produce a mix of each bad scenario each had a role in making. If this is the intent of Roger Campbell, the task has been accomplished.
