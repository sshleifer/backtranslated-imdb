"Chando's return" is noteworthy, so to speak, because of the choice of Bella Lugosi for the hero instead of the villain. Why even gets a girl. <br /> <br /> The story thus includes that the worship of black magic of Obasti tries to capture the last Egyptian princess Nagi (Maria Alba delicious) and use as a sacrifice as a means of sacrifice to revive their old leader who just happens to look like a survivor. Lugosi Dor Chando, who has magical powers, tries to thwart the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor is doing his best with limited resources and extensive stock picks. King Kong fans (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong in a critical position in several scenes. Representation is mostly, awful. For example, the actor who plays the role of the Grand Priest (I think Lucian Preval) uses an inspired version of the coach that was very common in early conversation. The less talk about others the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi accepts parts in quick links at this stage of his career, because he was still a possible star of Universal's banks at this time. Maybe that's because in this case he had to play the hero and get the girl you know. When his career began to decline in the late 1930s, this type of fare became the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
