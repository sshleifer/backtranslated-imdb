How this piece of garbage was placed in the film. The only actor who knows me at all is Judge Reinhold, the active actor whose existence is just a justification for his production. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's worth the nomination for the corrupt Tomato Award, this movie makes B movies really fun cinematic. A car is driving along the highway with police on its way, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, it is true. <br /> <br /> The script must be written on the back of a pack of cigarettes. Most TV movies are awesome but this redefines the word. Check the acting skills of the bridge operator, Pure Oscar material.
