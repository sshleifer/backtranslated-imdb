Soo, really show me a good man, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and disobeying orders, he was sent to prison (or rather a sort of work camp). He runs away, but after a short time he is caught again. This time ends with a strange realistic show where he is supposed to run for a while from a group of powerful players with different subjects and eventually die. But we all know that he has seen me, and we all know that he is tougher than the toughest players. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, being a fan of Ernie and all of them. However, "The Running Man" has a lot of disadvantages that really bother me. For example, the reconstruction of the battle showed me inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience showed a brief summary of the incident, with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter that flew Arni was equipped with approximately 10 cameras depicting crew members, one of which originated from a crew member. Arne. <br /> <br /> There are other drawbacks as well, and the plot, which in theory seems very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then creates a kind of stupidity and realism that sinks in it. <br /> <br /> Acting acting can not be said to be anything better than a par sub, with Arnie performing in a leading role, a normal Arnie performance. The other members of the team receive no good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fine, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
