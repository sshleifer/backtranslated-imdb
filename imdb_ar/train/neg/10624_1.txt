In a good review otherwise, says loseralacartelort7890, "The truth is that Americans are using secret anti-radiation agents, they are not well known, the exact specifications are a secret, and why is this a secret: Well, why should they disclose them at the time? With the Russians, it would be stupid to reveal that they have a new technology that can protect the crew from radiation. "This is completely untrue. There is (and was) a "secret" of radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo command unit has always been available to the public. It uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except for windows of course) is covered with a thermal blanket made of phenolic resin, more thickness at the bottom facing forward during re-entry. These materials are actually * better * in turning off the type of radiation that we have in the space (charged particles) of lead, which is better suited to shut down ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a specific problem for a long-term space flight due to the danger of large solar flares. But it was simply not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The driving unit gave them good protection during their short passage (1/2 hour or so) through Van Allen belts. They all took dosages so we knew exactly how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rn, usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of them landed), 18 are still alive. Only two have died of cancer: Alan Sheppard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Rosa), and motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
