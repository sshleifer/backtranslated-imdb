It's a terrible little movie - unfortunately, the company that made this short film made several other films. Short is basically the idea of ​​a joke that was not funny at first, and may hurt you too. It certainly made me uncomfortable to watch very young children (most of whom appeared at the age of two) walking and pretending to be adults - in this case, a dancer and a barber. It's a kind of humor that you may have to laugh at from your children if they pretend to be adults, but I can not see anyone who wants to see it - especially when wearing a little Shirley temple wearing a little outfit and working like a patch! After that, other children, such as adults, behave in some adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they did not try to appeal to child molesters, but when you look at it today, that comes to mind right away! For this reason, this boring film has crawled me and I hope I do not see it again !! Very strange and very wonderful.
