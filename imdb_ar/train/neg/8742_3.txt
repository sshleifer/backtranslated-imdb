After seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, I thought it was an original concept of excitement, putting it in the world of competing computer companies. All the cast stars had another message that this film would probably be good. But when I did not go to see it in the first week of its launch and then disappeared by week 2 I was afraid there would be something. I waited patiently for a DVD version, then bought it at home and hurried to watch an enjoyable evening. The anticipation of the way home was much better than the film. The beginning of the trend is appalling. It is not thought at all, and the director is a part of himself, so he can appear in the film. I will not rush to employ it in the future. Second, the main role is a fatal mistake just like Ryan Phillip. Phillipe is usually as wonderful as Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but he's supposed to be a modest hero trying to photograph him when he runs around with his eccentric genius friends, but he does not look good. Female stars, Rachel Lee Cook and Clare Furlani are not good enough, but when none of the shows are close to their best. The most prominent feature of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been achieved with his fiery temperament and mysterious ways of drawing the film. The last point is that this movie is another movie that fills the trailer with scenes you do not see in the movie and is only shown in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing more disappointment as if some of these scenes are primitive but fill important gaps in the story.
