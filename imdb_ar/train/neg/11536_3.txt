Well where do we start here? Straightheads offers me a bit of a dilemma. If this film came out of Italy, for example, in 1975, directed by Rogerio Diodato and starring David Hess, I would review it faster than drinking a water Labrador one summer day. Since Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy anywhere else in their tribute to the filthy cinema, Dan Reid produced a picture of his own rape / revenge mill in England, and on the same budget that seemed to take Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowan's leg into a submachine gun. If you want to play grindhouse bingo, let me call "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. A rich and highly professional woman who meets a little bit of the wrong side of the paths in an unreasonable way, and just as narrowly, you get For his warmth. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Free shots of a woman with a high career flying in several states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Develop a complex and highly unlikely scheme that prepares characters to do what they do and who can not be imagined outside the scenes. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. An unnecessary graphic rape scene committed by a male gang without a noticeable depth of personality or background other than having been raped. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Bold and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to rotate everything. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Straightheads are certainly fairly basic: Dyer meets Anderson and invites him to a party in a country-owned pile. On their way home, they harassed three local people in Landover who avenge by giving Dyer good shoes and raping Anderson's gang. Then the couple began to take revenge. So far, even "straw dogs", "late trains of the night," "house on the edge of the garden," "I spat on your grave" and so on. So why did not I think a lot about this film? There are a number of reasons: First, the likes of Gillian Anderson in the Premiere Team lead me to a better expectation, but this lack of honesty here is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Because whenever someone sits to watch Hess and his ilk terrorize women and kill their men in that period of the 1970s, they always know exactly what they get - low-budget shortcuts designed only for shock and the lowest common denominator. The bad guys frighten and kill the good things, run the things on the bad guys and kill them, and everyone goes home satisfied, and their desire to see a little of the abhorrent violence is safe, knowing that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, Dan Reid clearly believes that there is little to say about the state of the human psyche much more, as Dan desperately tries to drink his film with a philosophical depth that simply does not exist. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on the attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter, a subject of lust for the two men who hang out with him. When Anderson finally met him face to face, he admitted that he had raped her only as a distraction so that his friends would take their attention away from his daughter !!! The simple and bold way in which Reid drops this little revelation in the plot is simply to drop the jaw, it seems as if he expects this simple reference to sexual exploitation of children to be enough to throw the moral compass on the extreme limit and make them leave the cinema thinking they've just sat through something Importance. To make sure we get it, at this point, a series of rapes are shown for the second time, ostensibly from the attacker's point of view and attention to his daughter, but Reid ensures we get more shots Anderson deal with and rape through the hood. Gratuitous does not enter it. <br /> <br /> After telling him his reasons for raping her, Anderson tied him to a table, the scapegoat of a sniper rifle (complete with a huge muffler, only if no one is not clear on the rough images that lift his actions but lacks The courage to pull the trigger, and tell Dyer (who does not have such moral difficulties) that it is over, Dyer argues otherwise and presents an ethical dilemma as something Wittgenstein and Russell discussed in their Cambridge room about tea and cakes. She scoffed. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Ms. Anderson is doing her work throughout the film Reed is to leave Skolly behind, and bless her, and certainly does so; one wonders what Molder would have done from his ex-partner squatting down to the side of the road and then blaming a man with a gun. Dyer, on the other hand, is doing what he has done in almost every film he has made so far - that is, playing the role of a Gaur limp Glimni Gough with a harsh smile, a blissful line of clucking and a face that most people will never find tired of punching.This is especially true in the final scene where, after his cold-blooded killers, Dyer stares at the camera, I am sure to have, a look of existential pain that invites us to sympathize with the fate of hand-treated m E with ethical dilemmas that he had to overcome, but instead reminds us of Oliver Hardy, looking very enthusiastically to the camera after Stan and put it in another wonderful mess. Which by the way, summarizes this film very well.
