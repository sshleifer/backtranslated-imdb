The spoilers (though not revealed in the first few minutes of the film) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is very good at this as the emotional loser. He is psychologically human, even sympathetic, and really disappears in personality - is not easy for such a well-known performance. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste. Performance Booster (and performance) will not appear in their place in soft porn (this does not help make every character but 100% cardboard Sy). Sometimes, it seems that the director is actually trying to thwart the thrill: we know from the first moments a) that Si is a full function, b) that he survived, and c) that he was eventually arrested by the police. So, all that remains for us is the reasoning and the reasons, and the answers provided are not all that interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot shudders and splits, and includes some illogical moments (for example, the husband hates his wife for his expensive taste, although she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount store). About two-thirds of the way, Sy is so hopelessly stupid that one wonders why he really cares about the scheme of revenge. The final cliche interpretation of his mind, directly from "Peeping Tom", is an awesome copout. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is of the worst kind at all. Not written, embarrassing, unbelievable, or otherwise bad can be considered fun, even for bad film lovers. Instead, each line is functionally poor - it seems as though the director handed over a blueprint to one of the newspaper's authors and said, "Hey, I need a practical scenario in this - in one hour." This made me want to scream, frankly. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a return to the thrilling suburban thrills of the 1980s and 1990s ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"), and although it's certainly unpleasant, it's not really scary. Sometimes, Sy's intrigue makes you feel uncomfortable, but this in itself is not enough to make the movie work. In the end, this skill drowns in the lack of craftsmanship of all concerned, with the exception of Robin Williams. 3 of 10.
