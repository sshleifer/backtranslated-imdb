This movie is just awesome. Poor John Savage had to descend to this low level to be in another film. He plays starring as a rare type of vampire, helping a lady who looks washed up and gets a prostitute in the street at a local strip club. She tasted a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires when they are carried out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short commander of this rare strain of vampires that resembles the cross between the rock of the eighties of the twentieth century and one of Olsen's purple-haired twins. This film becomes completely insane through Rap Savage and dancing using a dwarf with a spider tattoo on his head, which is also a rare thing. Elephant quotes Man and Jimmy Durante and I had to laugh. This only gets rediculas. So the most powerful special effects she can make are Corey, whose members are released and released from her mouth. You can say that this is all fake. Her son does not know what to do with the identity of his new mothers and becomes more than just an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but I hate this film. Even the photography spreads from inside out, where the camera switches in this way and tries to make it look like vampires are moving so fast that the camera continues and then the camera turns bright in the scene of Savage chasing the son of Corrie around her until he blurs himself. Avoid this one!
