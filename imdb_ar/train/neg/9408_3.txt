She watched me watch a video clip of about 8 different cartoons for 1994-1997 and realized why I could not bear it when I first came out. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school, where 1967 happened, Spider-Man was the best cartoon and still the best. (I will not go into a psychedelic version which is terrible - give me the traditional bad guys please.) <br /> <br /> Acting in new things is lousy, reading a paper with no feeling or exaggeration. Paul Sols, where are you now? This man was the best voice in the representation of Spider-man. No one is approaching. Watch Secret Wars, a great idea about a mini-series of cartoons, made me understand. Dr. Doom looks like a comic version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull does not have any German accent while Ock Rossi is heavy! The old Marvel comic hero series of 1966 was much better than the voice representation Iron Man looked like he was wearing a steel mask, looked America's reliable captain and not as a young kid in his teens. Paul Fries was something in the 1960s that was the best thing of all. The old vocalists were pioneers and there would be no one like them. Did you hear Mel Blanc's son? There is no way that can be repeated by his father. <br /> <br /> Animation is not coherent. Well, so they have all the shades of luxury figures and beautifully painted balls. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if traffic is worse. Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements become robotic. I really do not think any of these animators know what. <br /> <br /> The stories are poorly written, and some of the lines they give to heroes are appalling. Why, for example, when co-heroes are together for the first time they start fighting with each other? In secret wars, a lame excuse made them in disagreement. I can see if the hero is dark, unknown and mysterious - like the punisher, but why neither Thing and Iron Man can upset their anger with each other is ridiculous, then join Torch. This is just a comedic following directions to make heroes sit on each other for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see those things. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe you can pull it out, but "hey what are you doing here" and "you do not tell me what to do" are lame reasons. Another scene is badly written in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne turns to spoil Peter's wedding. This whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, is what another critic calls "violent events" - meaning there is no punch at all. In Secret Wars, Lizard carefully ignored Thing's charge. But the thing pierces the bad guys across a whole block in comic books. He must simply go back to lifting heavy things and subjugating a bad man by grabbing him into the fees. Certainly, these cartoons are not strictly made for us as adults but for children under the age of 12. That's why they can not drill because the mother and father do not believe in this kind of violence. But you can blow things up, these fees will include. When I was a child before the emergence of political correctness, I saw moving cartoons hitting each other. What's wrong with the punch to cut? Is there really less violence in the world today because these new and wonderful cartoons have knocked out? I find this more insulting to everyone when I see new things. They wrote "punch" because we all can hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Kids enjoy this cartoon all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Valuation
