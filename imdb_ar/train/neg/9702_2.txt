I do not think this film has been properly evaluated. I took my copy and reduced the PG rating and wrote R. I would not recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, whatever the maximum R. <br /> <br /> Why? It has a scene in the forest with many naked Indian women. I do not know about you, but that's not something young children should see. True, this may be the traditional "clothing style" of the African Indians (?), But ... I think the partial nudity should give the film an R rating. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the film lately, but I think otherwise So, it was fine.
