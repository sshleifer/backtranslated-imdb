Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories in the film. The mother and her son move to a small town in Indiana in secret. They are asleep, creatures of the type of cats feed on young virgins. This small story has its share of unfairness and special effects. In addition to hints of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Craig is as wonderful as a mother. Other participants are Madsen Amic, Brian Krauss and Cindy Beckett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Cliff Parker. Stephen King Hijab as acting in the cemetery.
