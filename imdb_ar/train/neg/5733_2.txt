I just watched, and I and my half best do not believe how awful and ill-behaved it was. If anyone else thinks it's good, you should be happy. I actually gave up on a night to see this, all that was done before. Which. The springs came to mind, but at least that did not make you swing with the bad representation and lack of storyline, the same old things, re-hatching, I read a lot about this film, I recommended it to my colleagues, my fault, someone said it was good! No more courage, horror or reeling in disgust from the "scary film" the medium that is said, please do not care about this film. Get Mary Poppins. Now this is scary! I went out now, go to the cinema and watched something more frightening than this, maybe the sun's rays lost
