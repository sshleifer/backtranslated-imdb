The plot certainly looks interesting enough. How can a brutal, real murder turn into a really boring film? Well, you can see Wonderland and find out. <br /> <br /> I heard about the murders in Wonderland before the release of this movie and found it to be a really interesting story for some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is a zero evolution in personality, so we never have an opportunity to understand why any of these things or have a good sense of interpersonal relationships. The speed of the direction was very boring. All this leads to an unusually boring film. <br /> <br /> Since Dawn Schiller - a central character with Holmes's girlfriend - was a co-producer and Holmes's wife was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters.
