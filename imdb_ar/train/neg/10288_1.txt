First of all, I just want to say that I love this offer !!! But this episode ... this episode mocks the whole show. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they succeeded in creating the worst episode in the entire series. There is no story line, everything is chaotic and jokes ..... nonsense. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example "how idiots look" by creating this stupidity "that has already run ..." ... ... is simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Obviously the book is running out of ideas and this is really very bad.
