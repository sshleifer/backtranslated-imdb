Two old friends are sent to Japan to retrieve genetic research results containing a video, which was stolen by the appropriate black ninja at the beginning of the film. First, they just have to learn some ninja skill, because "only ninja are able to beat ninja". <br /> <br /> Sakura's killers try to be happy for ninja, but they fail badly. The entire film is just hollow and predictable and it is hard to say anything good about it: the same plot has been seen in different forms dozens of times before, characters are drawn briefly, the trend is boring and the script offers nothing surprising, even in the final scene, In itself to reduce the value (trash) of the film. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to find the 80 ninja fan, which understands the aesthetics of trash movies, this movie is hardly fun. It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, neither at the visual level nor in the plot. Shurikens and katanas are swinging, but not enough to lead the direction of the film which means to be repeated and scenes of similar fighting numb even the most brutal scenes after the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend a movie to anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in the movie "Enter Ninja" falls behind the American killer ninja in Sakura. Even in high-definition movies, there are no balls, and it's a waste of time to try and find any great fighting scenes in this movie: There are no scenes. All in all, one of the most violent ninja I have never seen before. It does not matter even in curiosity. Trust me in this. <br /> <br /> من out of 10.
