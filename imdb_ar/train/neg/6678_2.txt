This is a copy of the classic Doris Day story of 1948, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The story line is somewhat similar but contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp substitute to replace the pair on the trip. While Rani plays with a college girlfriend for a wife who does her same favor. They are ostensibly trying to hold each other while the actual husband and wife are trying to trip each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the journey, Govinda commits another girl to Sanjeev's wife and spies on her while he falls in love with her. Rani the magician. <br /> <br /> Lever plays a dual role for both father and son who specialize in divorce proceedings. They incited against each other to the belligerent couple. <br /> <br /> It's a bad attempt to copy original classics and songs are very horrible. Comedy is a yellow stick and will not make one laugh too much.
