I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, it seems that this worm lasts forever. It's one of those clicks that have the sad PG-13's status while not suitable for the child. Jokes are not just a few jokes or eyebrows, they are sleepy, obscene, and many acts cross the border not only for bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many of the scenes seem to have been cut to get a PG-13 rating ... very bad ... maybe you made a bigger splash like a R movie if the funny movie was left. (Exaggerated? Maybe.) Do not recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... I'm a fan of movies and I'm ready to do anything. In the 45th minute, the film seemed to have to end ... And the boy was ready for him. The end is quaint but does not save the rest of this swamp / tourist trap from the rental. Star 1/2 (glad to see him as a promotional gift ... it was possible to get sick to pay the hard earned dollar for this trip)
