As far as I'm concerned, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness, love or spirituality about this version, all this nonsense, german, wicked nonsense. The Nazis reminded me to fall in love. who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this film, we have John Gilbert and his evil cousins ​​Prince Shahwani after this ridiculous American actress, played by Mai Murray, and possess a modern hairstyle mixed with an unreasonable women's style we have thrown over and over again. I love my light and beautiful romances, with slow building processes. Not cruel and sadistic like this one. Come on, those shiny bee lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see a live show for viewing if you want to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar. If not, wait for TCM to display the audio version of Janet MacDonald-Maurice Chevalier. This is a lot better.
