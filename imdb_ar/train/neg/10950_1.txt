If I knew that the film was filmed in an irritating Dogme 95 style, I would never rent it. However, I took the drama to the sea and gave it a shot. It lasted for forty minutes before surrendering. It's just a boring, apocryphal buzzer. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was "The Romance" and it was also very depressing, but at least the camera was stationary and the necks of the characters were not breathing for a while. I was puzzled by Dogme 95's continued popularity abroad - it would be pursued in America at the same time as the next major leprosy. (Called Dogme 95 because this is the average number of times the actors in the eye are photographed with the camera.) <br /> <br />
