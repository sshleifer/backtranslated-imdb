The performance of Timberlake almost attacks the screen. Not all that was bad, I just think the role of correspondents was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the role of typical rapper and the hardest and harshest man. I do not think a cracked smile in the entire film, nor even when it was suggested to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman carried the whole movie. He had some funny scenes that represent the highest point in the film. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was "just there". <br /> <br /> In general, it's boring film. A bad plot. Many bad or wrong roles of actors.
