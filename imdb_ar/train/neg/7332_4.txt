Although it was a 2001 film, the trend is a sort of art of the 1990s that was considered "old" and old for several years. The cuts were cheesy and its effects painful to watch. The script is decent enough and there are a few scenes of my family (such as when a taxi driver drives to the bridge at night). But the story of the story with the interrogator whose sister killed herself and was obsessed with suicide was horrific. I was troubled by the performance of the actor who plays the role of her friend Salma Blair. Still, I sat in everything, which is rare for this kind of random film, what this movie you only find on TV and decide to watch.
