I've been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a long time ... with all the comments, nominations and media attention. I must say, the first quarter of the film was good! I filmed the black musical scene at the time. However, when I was wearing the film, my family and I felt bored by our intelligence. Singing continued to appear, one by one. I mean seriously, just a single musical number and it was possible to separate from RENT. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I noticed the difficulty of developing any characters in any of the characters. I just did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy died of an overdose of drugs, I knew I had to be sad, but I did not feel any sense of that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood etc., but not enough characters were detected to attract me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was not simply large enough to make care for viewers who goes hand in hand with a lack of personal development. This film reminded me of a film based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were fantastic movies in my opinion). In general, I think this film suits someone who does not really care about a full story, yet will enjoy two hours of entertaining and entertaining singing.
