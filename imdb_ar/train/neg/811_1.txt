The original film was good. I bought it on tape and saw it several times. Although I know that the sequences are not as good in the original as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The romance was flat, the old gags, and the spoken humor were not. Maybe this was not the worst film I've ever seen but it's coming closer.
