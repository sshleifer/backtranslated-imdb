We saw this on the shelf in the local video store, we saw the "coppola" in credits and we became enthusiastic. It was the only time that the film aroused any interest. I could not work at all if an attempt at a comic failed miserably, or an attempt to film my grandfather failed miserably. In general, the whole production seemed incredibly talented. The sound in particular was very awful, especially in the scenes filmed in the little bar; the dialogue was very trivial in the parts it was incredible. Very disappointing.
