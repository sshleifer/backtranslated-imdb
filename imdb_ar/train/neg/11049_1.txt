If Mr. Cranky disagrees, please just copy and paste it here. But since he did not, I would have to give him an experience myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this movie 1 instead of 0 is that the representation of Malcolm McDowell is excellent. However, he can not save this disaster film. The director must have really distracted him when he worked on this film because it is just a set of scenes that have been cast with very little continuity - reminiscent of the bad 1970s movies. Worse still, it seems that the actors and the director were doing it while they were on their side, and they might be able to explain how bad the original scenario was. <br /> <br /> It is not worth discussing the story line, although it is about a future called Proxate Corporation, which has assembled a crew of people who can be laid off to transport a dangerous cargo on an old ship / bondage to Nigeria. Computer This ship is a baby placed in a glass container and is connected to a crew member via USB 12 or anything else. The company should have been named Prostate Corporation because the entertainment value of the movie is equal to a test of the same name. <br /> <br /> Frankly I can not find one scene I can say that was well made and made no real sense in the context of the film. I saw it to the end as I had a touch of bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people who were actually worse off than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not bring this against him because he is a wonderful actor and every great actor has the right to a bad film in their professional lives and this is doosie. <br /> <br /> So, unless this is your only movie shopping out of the house or you are male and you are a doctor who does not have prostate exams this week and somehow feel that this is bad, then give this berth a wide truth unless Of course if you are really thinking about the community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.
