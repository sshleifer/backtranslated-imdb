Jim Carrey is one of the most entertaining and most talented comedians in the film today. Through spontaneous hyperactivity and his rubbery face, he can be crazy, and we love it. He has the ability to make modest comedy movies (Ala As Ventura) and turn them into decent comedy tours. Or, in the case of "Liar Liar", make them one of the most contemporary comedy films Farhana. Curry also proved his ability to deal with dramas. He was excellent in both Man on the Moon and Truman Show. The man is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Then comes "Bruce Almighty," an ideal vehicle for Carrie, and a hypothesis that should have worked; Carrie, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is empowered with the powers of God. However, the scenario is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad the scenario, Carrie improvisation alone sometimes makes a funny scene. The problem is that there are very few opportunities to unleash Carrie because a lot of comedy relies on silly special effects, some of which are just amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to solve special effects. The book seems to think that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the film is just a stuffing that does not give Curry anything else that works alongside a wonderful personality without a soul. It seems like a 5-year-old longing for our attention, and wants the viewer to find what he does funny, when it's really annoying. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on "friends" and she was fantastic last year's "good girl". She also has a gift for comedy, but with the written text as she is, she is simply given a part of her time girlfriend. They are encountered as annoying and angry, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> Bruce Almighty should have been a successful comedy. But she does not have the courage to address the subject he is making fun of; A few slight giggle (the Internet is Jehovah), but instead turned only into a comic comedy of great power. Not to mention that it moves from a silly tone to a heavy, even a black comedy at times. The movie failed at almost every level. This does not mean that he is completely free of laughter, but he is close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate dog scenes peeing to get a laugh has problems. But hey, if you find that jokes urinating funny, look for them. <br /> <br />
