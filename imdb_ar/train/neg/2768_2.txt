This film was terrible. <br /> <br /> They have not developed any characters at all and the story has been horribly displayed. He was a specific sleeper. You'd expect the motion scenes in a movie like this to be his strong point, but D-Wars will surprise you even in this section. <br /> <br /> Also, acting was just a step higher than the level of low budget porn flick. I mean that seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the final credits for this reason because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do people, do not waste your time and money in a crazy movie like D-Wars.
