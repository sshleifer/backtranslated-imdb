If you watch this without having to spin around an idea about the story, then you are in a surprise. Even so, the abstract drew a picture of fairly rational stories, but the actual film is nothing. <br /> <br /> As the summary goes, it tells the climber of a Jealous Mountain, which you will see as an introduction to the opening credits and crawling to the text, which tells you of the existence of Cronopolis, the fictional city in dreamy manuscripts of mind (note that the self causes the problem of flashing lights) , Where its inhabitants long for immortality in both. They can see our world, and everyone is aware of this mountain climber, and the summary explained that they decided to contact him through chemistry, creating a clever space to meet the man. <br /> <br /> What is translated is a repetitive piece of animation that can be produced by a 5-year-old child. Create shapes, although the credit goes to a stop motion mode, and put it through a stunned loop. Repeat until your eyes close, then go to the next scene. If there is anything, the Chonopolisians (if found) really like their sticks and balls, and always play in invoking this magic field, and playing together days before releasing it in the "other" world. This will not improve, when the man interacts with the ball in another boring and exciting sequence of sleep. <br /> <br /> We thank, of course, that the run time is shorter than what was announced, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the announced 70. Despite its steady history, its faded colors, a non-existent story, narcotic music and repetitive images will not win any fans. do not waste time.
