This movie is just lame. Total waste of time and money. Jokes are expected, characters are very vulgar, and the way they talk about RPG players is not too funny. The problem is that the writers do not know how the RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a bunch of losers who are playing RPG game like backward losers and losers. But for me these are not the funniest ways to make jokes about this game. The story is meaningless at all. Who cares how long the game is played? The biggest problem with this film is that the writers and actors have not even tried to figure out what RPG is about to release jokes about. I was ashamed to watch this lame movie.
