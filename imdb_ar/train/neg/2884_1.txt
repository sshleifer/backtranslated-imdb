While working at a video store, I found it my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I have ever seen and warn my friends and colleagues about it. On a day of particularly hot debate about what's the worst film, my friend dared to watch B.T.K. Killer, so that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst film ever, he would look at it. I lost. I think I even made better videos in high school, and that was hardly a great achievement from a young genius. This film is not only lacking what seems to be a productive value (it seems to have been filmed on a bad video camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, pathetic not scratching the surface) . Suddenly I was reminded of some bad school plays (I know I have been to high school a lot here, but it seems to have happened very much) both in terms of the group that looked very fake, but also as if People were reading their lines of script, not quite sure what was actually happening. My evaluation does not lead to justice in this film, because I can not describe the sheer horror of the time spent watching this film. It is ironic to do a pathetic act as a pathetic excuse for a film.
