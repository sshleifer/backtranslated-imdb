Creepy and the wolf is a punk. The young "Red" wears a full jacket and a very short jacket. I got about 20 minutes and realized that it could be a dream of sexual exploitation of children really. The "rising" music seems to be pretty much like something I've heard in a strip club. In fact, I think this is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Overall, happy because I was watching this with my daughter, I do not want her to think it is normal for families to watch semi-porn together. Very bad, very sad it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatun is likely embarrassed by his presence in it. What is advertised as "amazing special effects" ??? The effects looked low budget, and there was a terrible.
