Who in his right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time as they portray an emotional scene between two people? When Feliper faces his dark wife in the dressing room, the song that sings with lyric content is like a dialog box, so neither of them can be heard, thus alleviating any emotional impact the scene might have. Anabella's scenes were beaten by her father with his fists, then a lamp, and he was so caricature that it was ridiculous. This entire film is a cartoon, and the pervasive bias against the eggs is literally astounding. The debate among black women after Flipper's wife discovers that he has cheated her with a white woman - as if the debate were by a team at Oxford, is ridiculous. It may be possible to continue rampant racism, but sound and audio mix during the "film" too much. The film was technically poorly made. There is no understanding of the basic craft of filmmaking, the audio track, editing, and the desperate attempt by senior actors trying to keep this film standing. I felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this case - his appearance was painful. This is the first film I saw by this director and it will be my last movie.
