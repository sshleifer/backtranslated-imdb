This film was very silly. There were a few funny parts. He goes to the film box in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... This film contains a few funny parts, but in general, a silly plot (or lack)." I thought it seemed that Ben was trying a little hard to be a funny young man. I did not understand how he was a millionaire millionaire and still such a fool. Anyway, I love Ben Affleck. He makes some nonsense, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I loved Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was all I did was wrong, I love him in general. I think it's kind of like a child who feels sorry for him because he can not look good. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid this. Did not develop into a viable conspiracy and did not use Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy J. They deserve better. In general, this film is not home alone, it's not the Christmas story, the Christmas holiday or any of the other classics. Forget forever.
