This film goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days in Hollywood is worth watching. Just because you got an excellent squad crew does not mean that this can beat the script that maybe written by the chimpanzees! Think about it - the film featured Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Bauer, Gloria Graham, Lilian Gish and Paul Stewart, yet the film was bad! The basic premise of the film is not bad - a psychiatric hospital where staff are more stable than patients! Also, the subplot involving the husband and wife was overloaded (Widmark and Graham) a lot of promise. However, the script was treated with all the ingenuity and ingenuity of the buffalo drunk - with intrigue and road on the top scenes repeatedly in the film. In fact, it was like a drama and a very bad episode of the General Hospital. Hidden, this movie is not !! Realistic, this film is not !! <br /> <br /> While the reason for this movie was a bad one, I also blame producers for misusing and misusing old actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a familiar name, but this character actor has exceptional talent - especially when gangsters play in Film Noir. However, Stuart is here a very indescribable psychiatrist and a strange European accent - this did not work much because it was out of his range and his character was completely undeveloped and one dimension. Also, Charles Boer seemed just hopeless and completely loser. The sight of this beautiful romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of America is a strange sight. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fairly horrible film. It's a very watery game in the wreckage of a train kind of way but it certainly is not beautiful. My wife and I hated a large part of the film, but I also felt that it would have been very good if the writing had qualified. . In real life, the bright East spent much of his life inside and outside the mental institutions.
