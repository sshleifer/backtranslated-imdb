My, how mighty fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress but she certainly was back down when she took on this role. This film is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic. It seems like one of those films that could have been passed with all its own slots if they were released in the 1980s and 1990s but in 2008 they look really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> Story Details Della (Kim Basinger) started buying gifts at a mall harassed by a gang of thugs who ended up killing a policeman who came to help her. Since then, these stupid fools have been chased by one of the abandoned streets and disposed of one by one using a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> There are many wrong things in this movie. As I said this movie jumps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is bad for television. Hell, this poignant story is designed for bad TV. The way you kill these politically correct thugs (one Caucasian, one Hispanic, one African American and one African-American, all united to pursue a Caucasian woman.) Do not you love America? The way you killed a Hispanic man made me hysterical. The sex scene with the main leader was out in the left field, which makes you shake your head in disgrace.I recommend this only to bad film lovers and no one else.No one else, especially Kim Basinger fans, will do better to not have this click.You do not want to see a respected actress in a movie That's bad now, is not it, of course not, you've been warned.
