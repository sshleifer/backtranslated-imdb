As one of the few commentators who did not watch the first film, I found this film very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Yes, it contains a kind of funny, funny humor if you can afford (high degree) a morally questionable hypothesis. However, it fails dramatically in task areas. <br /> <br /> There is a meaningless high-profile plot that includes a generous friend of Gordon Sinclair who may or may not have been involved in a plot to supply dangerous electronics to Third World countries - perhaps on free computers ... or maybe not. Mysterious and long winds are inconclusive. The lack of any substantial end is a source of great anger, and what is present is utterly comic and illogical. The film feels that it is not over yet. <br /> <br /> The suspension of disbelief is very difficult to see when a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be attracted to Gordon Sinclair's disrespectful character, especially when she resists her progress. laughable. Gets worse later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions and then throws them all into some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Do not leave me a lot of movies I feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
