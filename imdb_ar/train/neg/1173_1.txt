If I had only one camera that was accidentally taped on the floor, it was only one film per shot, then I lost all that movie and I had to pull out some dollars to buy some digital videos and I had to make a film that lasted more than two hours for the French Revolution He did not have any groups, and my 4-year-old autistic son had to paint the backgrounds, and the only actors I could find were people who did not. " Do not use any music in the entire movie, k Since the zoom function in the camera did not work until once when I started zoom in, stop, oh, and if I hated my Republican, then I might do something like that, but misguided by mistake, is a waste of time. Which looks great but is completely faked with some of George Lucas' latest creations, making it even more frustrating because, through the entire film, there was little hope in the back of my mind that the film would culminate in the laser battle of the JetSphere duel. I do not mean to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, but that's not how it ends. The only thing I can think of is to waste more time watching this movie than writing this review. Peace.
