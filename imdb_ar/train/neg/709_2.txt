This film was badly written, directed and acted upon as a beggar. You must remodel it using a script, manager and a better casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beels on the polished, professional and credible side, on the other hand, Richard, who misuses it sadly and fails in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are quite perfect because the slave has (and maintains) the couple, although they both work well in the habit. Representatives (and directors) should not have tried to make accents at all - they are inconsistent and unbelievable. It is better to focus on doing good work in actual English. Casting is ridiculous. Why did the children of the "African" merchant (and therefore less socially interested in the Jean de Colour community) exhibit very pale-colored actors, while socially desirable Marcel, who had African features, including "blond", was clearly dyed? It seems as if casting managers can not be bothered by reading the text they choose and choosing the right actors from a wide range of talented and physically diverse actors. It's just too weird! This may be a great film and must be redrafted, but with people who respect the material and can choose suitable and skilled actors. There are a lot of good actors out there, and it would be interesting to see how Jennifer Bells, Daniel Sungata, and Gloria Robben will do it with suitable actors, good text and good guidance.
