A bit of a disappointing film, I would say: acting was represented, one way or another. In many cases, I could not feel that facial expressions match spoken words or the intention of the scene. You must make an angry personality (or sad, happy, frustrating) viewer think he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). This does not happen here. <br /> <br /> Commenting on the book that you are supposed to already know that the characters were right for him. They do things and say things that do not come from anywhere: Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then explodes and goes outside, telling his father "Do not touch me, you ***!". Perhaps, if we see the pre-set, we will understand where all this comes from, but there is no prepaid package, so we are at sea somewhat for the reason! <br /> <br /> One of the weird, exotic things Andrew does is go to an old stone quarry, sit on the edge of the "static water" below; then he reaches the pocket of his garden and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights up one. He did the same thing three times during the film; I think we're supposed to see this as an act of torture in loneliness and anger? Maybe once, but three times? Maybe four times, I lost their number. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is a fact that he recently discovered that he was built; this happens very early in the film, so there is no big change that could happen because of this discovery. It is not really clear whether this is why it is so bitter or whether it relates to something else. <br /> <br /> I think there is some sort of sense of Lixian in the film but should the director first try to expand such a mountain too early in his career?
