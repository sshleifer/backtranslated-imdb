I ask the motivation behind the creators of this fantasy account for the motives of BTK killer. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think that the people concerned with this beast are doing enough harm? What a blatant disregard and exploitation of the victims! It was a personal experience: what bothers you more, the slaughter or human murder? They used real names for some victims .... This film was ugly, disrespectful and humiliating! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their agenda! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
