Film "Nineteen Eighty" film about a future society in which the government controls everything and can not be trusted. It's a very dark film, a movie that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about the romance that takes place in this society, the betrayal of lovers and the self-centered human nature. The film contains some very good ideas and is well executed in portraying this community in dark colors (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and the general feeling of loneliness through things, people and places. However, despite the film's ingenuity in portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to look good. He seems to spend a lot of time being smart rather than telling the story.
