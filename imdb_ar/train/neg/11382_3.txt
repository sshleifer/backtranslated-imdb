Anyone notices that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes seem to give each enemy. 2. Holding hands face to face and mouth and scary eyes. 3. The Tommy Turnbull Smiling. <br /> <br /> I must say that I hate this offer to a great extent, and I do not see it but it is like Code Lyoko, we have all seen at least one, I must assume that this offer is racist on the border, uninterested and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with an automatic robot win, with the exception of one exception when a robotboy basically allows this freakazoid ingenious genius to fly away on a jetpack. <br /> <br /> Bricks are also very strange, I think they are mostly people who say the word "Suck" or Jitran, I think the scream of the show is very shocking. <br /> <br /> The bowling ball hides under his hatred, the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school is going. Not to mention his older brother, who is mentally unstable on the border and has no other personal qualities. <br /> <br /> The full show I feel is the massive XLR ripping and the Fosters. Like you can say that Tri-fold, Jimmy and Kiva, as well as Robotboy is similar to Megas where he outperforms everyone regardless of the odds and he's free in spirit despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There simply is no appeal for this offer, I was surprised that it is still running.
