Stanley Kramer directs a thriller and leaves two main things: motion and excitement. The DOMINO Gene Hackman principle is introduced as a convicted convict from prison for some mysterious tasks. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Walach are his activists - they are supposed to be working for the government, but this, like most film schemes, is never clear. Hackman poses a lot of questions that have never been answered so the film never goes anywhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO PRINCIPLE blends ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film was filmed very well but even works against it. The direction of Kramer is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> Good acting with Hackman proves that he is pretty much unable to be bad. Widmark and Wallach are appropriately disgusting and Albert is well portrayed as hard in Widmark. Even the rogue Mickey Rooney is usually as good as the sidekick for Hackman. One curious casting is Candice Bergen as a wife of Hackman. We were told that she spent time in prison and seemed to be trying to put some sort of southern twisting. Kramer's idea of ​​making her look like a trailer garbage is to make her wear an ugly brown wig. It is a more suitable role for the likes of Valerie Perin or Susan Terrell.
