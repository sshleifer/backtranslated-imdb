Most of what viewers will remember is the bad headaches caused by the film because of the slow and fragile camera action and the fast and confusing pieces. I am not against this kind of stylistic devices if they were done properly like Oliver Stone and Stephen Soderbergh with most of their films, but in this case there were a lot of ways. The quick jumps and flashes of light that accompanied every flight over Mexico City seem to have been, and every important scene there was to let you know that the story was too thin and that everything was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how it will end up entirely. For the film, which pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is unforgivable that his story has been told several times and with a more profound and personal development. This is the other disappointing aspect of the film. If I wanted to watch "Best Action," I do not need any justification, but this film tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington and failed to make any credible offers. Nothing happens in the first half or so, except that vulgar models and cliches are filmed, and when the moving machine begins to rotate, it is cut so fast that it does not know what is actually happening. So the film does not work either on the level of drama / sensationalism, or as a purely film. Of course, the film is not as bad as some of the completely distorted films in recent years, but I do not understand at all why many people claim that this film is new and very refreshing. For the video, its length is too long and for the film it contains very little material.
