Oh, in order to scream out loud, this film must be the LAMEST that I've seen all year, and I'm sorry because John Cusack Horror was usually involved in this stupid film which is not without minds. Where Sleepless delivered in Seattle the same message, albeit on a more intelligent and more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a heavy hammer and then continues to throw it at yourself for the boring hour and a half hour or so (this is an hour and a half of my life I will not go back again) Very much !!). It's bad that the main characters in this film have a 14-year-old emotional maturity (in fact I knew better than the age of fourteen ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Beven, who was enjoying enough. In the first 15 minutes or so of the film, where Kate Beckinsell's character plays those absurd absurdity of the game about throwing all the sensitivities to the wind (literally), he was my best friend and I am angry at believing. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligent information, and at least, the characters in Rockstar were not half of the dysfunctional idiots in this "coincidence" mess. It is annoying to see supporters who have no idea of ​​choice in their lives, and feel that they are nothing but puppets and freaks. How completely tired. I'm sure this film will probably be enjoyed by those who prefer not to participate in anarchic anarchy of making more complex life choices and then living responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a movie in which our hero and hero live happily ever after after the chaos and misery of two other lives (let alone their fiancé), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
