When you choose a film that I hope will reflect on a factor, do actors in the film use their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is an ethical issue that affects society. When a comedian / actress gives sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father, we must ask ourselves (do I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Fox's behavior is torn in the social fabric that teaches our youth the rightness of error, good behavior from bad that kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Fox must remember that it is just entertainment and there are many things we can choose from. Say sorry do not get him out of the hook. This harm will not hurt or remove the bad behavior that spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. You no longer see anything they are part of. We can not change them but we can stop the fame we give them.
