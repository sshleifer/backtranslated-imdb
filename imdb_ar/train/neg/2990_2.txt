Hey man! Now that's what I'm talking about! As far as go / horror horror clicks go this movie was really in its own category. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the film was not originally in English. This is good because voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here are my favorite excerpts from the dialog box (there are a lot of where it came from)? "I feel a little better, I feel thirsty for yourself!" <br /> <br /> What a drama! Here is a play theatrical summary of the interaction between the army and scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1? Scientist: "Can not you do that? - Military officer: "This is just a science fiction" (then begins to cause a complete disaster just as the world predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2? Scientist: "If you do that, a lot of people will die !!!" - Military officer: "You do not know what you are talking about." (He does so and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3? The world: "Do not do it? It will kill everyone!" - The military officer: "This is nonsense" (then begins to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7? (You can get the idea). <br /> <br /> If that is not enough? There were a few scenes that really figured out as instant classic! In one scene, the army literally had 10 men pointing their guns at unarmed men. The commander screams, "Go and get!" All the ten army men, one at a time, throw their guns and fight the two adversaries! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> Do not worry. Did not leave attention to detail! This film had keyboard / tuner sound for a 80 / superior board to set mood! <br /> <br /> Trust me ?? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are a lot of goodies in this epic, I already scratched the surface only. A film of this caliber comes out just once every decade! Experience watching a real movie! Masterpiece! Wonderful!
