As a stunning person in the stunning "Hero" photos, I was keen to see this film, which was described as similar, but better. She also appeared actress loved by: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed by both cases. I purchased the DVD for this movie, and it was a mistake. It was not the best. <br /> <br /> I realized that these martial arts films were pure fiction, but this story has so far eluded anything that has made my head giggle with disappointing disbelief. Blind woman beat hundreds of opponents? Sorry, this goes a little further. Also, the main character, Takeshi Kaneshiro, was very disturbing through his dialogue, the stupid look on his face and the stupid laugh, that he also destroyed the film. <br /> <br /> In spite of the brilliant colors and the amazing action scenes, this story - to me - did not have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning, this film is not my "hero"!
