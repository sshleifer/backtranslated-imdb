My title is just summarizing this heap of slag, and I should have picked up a hint when I saw it as a unique film olen Ray - but I thought "hey, it might be better than his usual boy", he was wrong! This should be the worst film targeted at children at all. The acting was awful, the humor did not exist, and the Direction was the worst I've ever seen & the special effects would not look in place in the Disney movie of 1950. <br /> <br /> What happened to DeWell Stone! Who once had such a promising career in the 80's. The film's veteran actor and former actor, Temblin, was a very bad man and the budget was so low that it was absolutely incredible even as a movie of children's movies. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the film that was made in 1999 and I do not intend <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie for children, "HONEY I ShrunK / BEDW UP THE KIDS / KID" or ANY DISNEY MOVIE <br /> <br /> My ratings as A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> Rating as a child film: - 3/10 at best!
