The film begins fine. Widowed with his new girlfriend and children. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of stupid choices. Such as "easy separation". "I'm coming to ...." Do what? Stupid stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time in the hope that it will improve .............. not barely.
