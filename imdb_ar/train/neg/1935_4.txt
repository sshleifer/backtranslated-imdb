Chinese Ghost Story III is an unnecessary sequel to two fantastic fantasy films. The film presents the special effects that can be expected, but they fail painfully on all other fronts. All actors play very silly cartoons. You must be in diapers to find her delicious mouthpieces even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, development sometimes wrong and often slow. In the end, the film begins to resemble the old Godzilla movies, including the shabby old-fashioned special effects and the ghost (good, and another) of Godzilla's head. Maybe I was grinning if I expected the camp. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to see what lovers of fiction have to bear - in this case because someone thought he could squeeze a few extra money out of a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow has died as a dodo.
