It seems that this film is made by someone who has some good ideas, but he has never made a film before and did not consider it necessary to edit the script or even that funny. When I saw this film, I saw it for John Candy and mistakenly assumed it would be a joy. Instead, there was a stupid conspiracy about mind control and a lot of unusual flat moments. At the highest level, Candy presented some of the most horrifying lines I've heard up to then. So, despite the funny idea of ​​the story and the stories, we have left with an amateur and raw film that is likely to be too stupid for an average adult, although teens may find some laughter. It's really shameful - it could have been much better. I mean that with Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty and John Candy, it should be great.
