I went in not knowing anything about this film and went out in half an hour to find out everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a nice person in general, but if someone tells me that I like this movie, I may never talk to him. Anybody you like is likely to have a very dry personality and a heavy personality. I will also include that they think they are also very smart, just like the self-centered wind bags that make the movie sound. I know that everyone has different kinds of humor, some people may not like myself, but that's good; I do not think this covers any combination of humor. This film is flat and boring like Wis Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to go out; it's better to get your money back too.
