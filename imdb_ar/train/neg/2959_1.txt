No matter what anyone tells you, there's just the truth of the word "possession" in film circles - like "What made you give the green light to this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does not. That is, if your head is clear and you are keen to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels, I've tried to rationalize where this movie will be enjoyed ... or even the average consumer. The star? the story? Unique Idea? A friend's film loves children with a dinosaur and a black woman? Oh my God! I'm sure when this was an "idea", it looked good. But somewhere during the development process ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not be translated into a piece of entertainment that anyone would like to see or pay for ... unless it was too deep under the influence of alcohol or drugs and we saw Something the others could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Chaos, chaos - sin and chaos. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what's the plot?) and others. Whoopie got a salary, but I was going to be embarrassed to take it. I hope to expel her agent / director / publicity because of this obviously professional move no, continued to produce bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
