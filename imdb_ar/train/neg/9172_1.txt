When I go to see a movie about the zombie, I do not expect an Oscar or a Godfather writing, but I expect the actors at least do not seem to be nervous about reading their cards, and this dialogue does not look like it was written 10 minutes before reading it in the camera. This movie was awful. I woke up and left about 25 minutes and went home and saw the Cold Creek Manor. That was not good either, but it looked like a citizen of a country like this. On the plus side, the girls were very beautiful, and maybe this was the only thing I kept in my seat for longer than the first five minutes, in fact I left after someone was killed, and there was nothing I would comment on afterwards.
