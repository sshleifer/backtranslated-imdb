Vovochka is a rioters every day vs. power film. Vovochka, the main character, described early as a bad influence on children in the neighborhood. In the wise words of the two adults who met them along the way, he found changing his harmful ways difficult, but worth doing. Personally, I found that the actor who played Vovochka very annoying did not sympathize with him, but changing the tone of the film will allow most people to feel the emotional conflict Vovochka faces when he wants to be good but bad things continue to occur. This conflict makes the film a little different from other films of the same genre, this is the small flavor I meant. All in all, I did not really care about this film, although it was probably directed at a younger audience.
