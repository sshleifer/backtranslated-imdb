I went to see this a few days ago, it is hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. It's supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theater (perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), it's boring, boring and boring. It was sometimes difficult to understand what they were saying. They speak only of fasting and do not open enough to understand us. I was with a friend and over 4 or 5 times I caught myself after the line was supposed to be funny "What, what did he say", I'm French. I hate to say that, given the fact that I think the good films are being produced here, I apologize in advance to all the foreigners who will go to watch the film (if it appears outside of France). <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for this cr @ p. 10/02
