In fact there was not much of a story in this film. It loosely based off the events in the movie The Lion King I. It is supposed to be how Timon and Bumba met through their unit. But there is not much more. <br /> <br /> It mixes some scenes from the original, then explains how to change this movie to them a bit. But still, is this? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think if you want to see other meerkats in the Lion King world, that's the case. But otherwise, it does not do justice to a little of animation. Disney should really stop these products direct to the video. It was really very boring and could be used by Jason Statham. "Dr-"
