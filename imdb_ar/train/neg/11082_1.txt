I know it is a gimmick to Power Rangers and meet the needs of children aged 7 years, but really why they took themselves seriously with this film? If they want to write a plot using crayons, you have at least the decency to make them silly. It's kind of funny if you see this. We have a model family full of vulgar characters (the veteran father of the war who lost his wife and blame himself LOLOL), the children who try the burden of air and try to fill the stereotype, but they fail in the terrible representation, and the owner of the awful wings does not serve any purpose to the film but to fill the camera space . Funny stuff! <br /> <br /> However, the real moment is nearing the end when the father of war and the evil villain tries to fight the sword, but then realize that none of them knows how (perhaps) because there is no budget space for the choreographers ), They have developed the type of American wrestler to roam. LOL. <br /> <br /> Evaluate 1/10 because they are trying to deal with this seriously.
