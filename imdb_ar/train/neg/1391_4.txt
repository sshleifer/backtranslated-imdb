Before this TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was manufactured after the last episode of the series and the disappearance of many original copies. There is no President Sheridan, Dylan, Lennier, Londo, Fair, Jecker or Lita. If you remember, in the second to last episode of the series, all regular elements except Zack and Vir and Captain Lockley B-5 left permanently. Now for this film, Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5) returned to join Zack and The Captain and the Doctor in a short and irrelevant appearance. But because there is a lot of old chemistry, this film is already severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen), who is introduced to Babylon 5 for a ball full of souls stolen from a hidden repository by archaeologist Ian MacShane. A lot of scary mumbo jumbo stuff happens but frankly everything was ridiculous and meaningless. Yes, yes, the station blew up almost but it was all saved, but frankly I felt it was the case "it was done - and I've done it a lot better in the past." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The secondary conspiracy, To slap with suit. It was a blur, but he made some laughs - something that the other bleak plot certainly lacked. <br /> <br /> By the way, Shin initially did a good job in The Must Hunter - with his cool eyes and strange delivery. However, again and again throughout the episode fell on character. It had to be discovered and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final rule is that this is only for B-5 hardcore nuts (like me). Others believe that it may be assumed that the series sucked - a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that does not know when to quit.
