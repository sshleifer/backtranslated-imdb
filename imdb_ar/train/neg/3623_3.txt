(Aka Blood Castle or Devil's Cry) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was a CD-ROM feature, a shared invoice was created with VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian joint production where a series of women are killed in a village At about the same time a local census named Janus Dalmar is seen on horseback, riding behind his dog, the man eating behind him. <br /> <br /> The city's residents doubt that he is the person behind all this and want his castle to burn. The killings began for the first time soon, as Count Igor Dalmar, the elder brother of Count Janus, was burned in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Ivana (Erna Schweer) hired by Igor before his death helped. His experiences in his shows. Janus agrees to hire him instead of his brother and they are working together for dead cell regeneration formulas. Janus wants to bring Igor's charred body back to life. <br /> <br /> But Igor is still alive (though he was burned horribly) and is hunting and killing women in the village. We see his roast face on charcoal showing at different points in the film, so we know he is still alive, making the whole thing fairly clear. <br /> <br /> Igor meets the end of another fire when he reaches a fight with Yanos on Ivanna, the burning candles fall on the same bed as Igor, and meets another end loaded with inscriptions. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from the VHS source and looks very grainy and nasty. Unlike scratching trailer, no other additives are included. Although it is characterized by a wonderful Spanish castle, attractive and good atmosphere, it is found to be rather boring and predictable without any excitement or ambiguity at all. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
