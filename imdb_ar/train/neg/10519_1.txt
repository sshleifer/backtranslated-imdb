I've seen a lot of movies and rarely have I rated '1', but this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was silly, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I watch scary movies, I think it's DUMB when you hear the characters in the house / jungle / school / etc, and then shout "Is there anyone there?" - but at least, they are likely to do so. This film could not even get it right. <br /> <br /> This is a film that will produce other B-horror films such as Venom and The Fog that look like award-winning academic masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a waste of time as I write this comment so that anyone else thinking about watching this movie will think again. terrible!
