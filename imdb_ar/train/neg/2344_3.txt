For me this just comes as a soap opera. I think any portrayal of extravagant people can be considered a "social comment". But in the final analysis, I simply do not care how you describe this film. None of the characters are very pet or attractive. I did not feel any chemistry between Hudson and Buckal. If there is a love story here, they are lost in a state of distress. Despite the collapse caused by the complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) reflection of Dorothy Maguire on the witness platform, the story is not enough to hold my attention. Regardless of the amount of Freudian symbolism and psychology, this story is haunted, melodramatic and smiling. <br /> <br /> The Hudson Rock is extremely wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's least attractive and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspirational performances, but her personality is sordid, pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving father of two unknown adults, is the most sympathetic person. Most interesting of all, Robert Wilkie has a sharp appearance in a small role as the bar owner. It is best to remember him as a bad cleric in countless Westerners, but here is a sincere and loving colleague. <br /> <br /> I take up my social comment with an interesting story and a few cute little characters, thank you.
