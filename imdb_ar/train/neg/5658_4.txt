"Laughter, laughter clown" released in 1928, legendary stars Lun Chani as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a poem (young and beautiful Loretta Young) into adulthood and naming her Simonita. Tito raised the girl into a circus life and became a successful ballet dancer. While Shani presents his usual impressive performance, I can not overcome the fact that Tito, now middle-aged, enjoys the sweetness of young Simonita. Although not her biological father, he raised her as a daughter. This kind of factor "ick" permeates the film. Tito competes for Simonita's feelings with the young "Count" Luigi (Niles Esther). It is clear that Simonita falls on the young man, but feels guilty about giving up Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is silly, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito what a stupid old idiot he is (until he himself reveals it in the end) the film is only noteworthy because of Loretta Young, who will continue to have a wonderful career. While I admire Shani's brilliance as an actor, this entire film seems to me quite creepy.
