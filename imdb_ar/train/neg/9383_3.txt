VERY BAD MOVIE ........ I mean VERY BAD ... This plot is predictable, it is very cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the scenes of dancing in time is the only reason I did not give him one film, otherwise ... this is the movie that One can not afford to watch it ..... I feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the film was an interesting kind of cliche .. ..bring the country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but I feel that maybe it was a little better at least if it was not Very cheesy, very bad portrayal of the idea to the screen, I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, although the dance I can say AT TIMES, is very good, was the development of the dance dance battle well ..... if you just film the movie and watch the dance scenes and the composition of your own dialogue perhaps can To be 5 ... lol
