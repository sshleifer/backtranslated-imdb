This film could have been an interesting personal study and could have given an insight into his subject but the real problem in this film is that it contains nothing of this. Does not give any visibility or solutions to the problem. It is just a picture of the "old" sex addiction to the male and the problems it creates in his daily life and his natural family. Why do you want to see this? It's all meaningless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It does not really help that the main character is some men over the age of 50. You will have difficulty identifying yourself and sympathizing with him. It looks like just a dirty old playboy, a permanent pursuit of women and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse about 3 times a day with a different woman and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> Nor does he have a bad visual style, although he is all coerced. However, everything seems better than most direct productions to video. Who knows, if filmmakers had better material to work with, the film deserved better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is really ridiculous at times. There are already some useless plot lines which are often more funny than they were supposed to be. I'm talking about a whole example Ordell line plot. Things get worse once the film starts to move towards the end. The entire story is told, as the events that have taken place and the main character sessions with his psychiatrist seem cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But for bad films, this is not just one of them. It is not really better or worse than any direct flick on the video, with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems very strange and amazing to shoot Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. Simple production is a little simple because this is one. I think they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
