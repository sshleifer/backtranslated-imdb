After seeing the first 20 million of Blanche (sorry I could not afford more), she now confirmed that she was not doing it. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this "film" is an insult to the real French actors involved in this comic strip of scrap. It begins with a concept that has been successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with old tones / dialogues. This can give great results if supported by great actors and "ingenuity" in the direction of avoiding the stigma of the dreaded "heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon with a fairy face destroys everything and Blanche, instead of comedy, just turns into a horror film. A horror of pineapples who want to be puzzled and shocked as they watch great actors such as Dickawen, Zim or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this kitsch-shattering joke.
