This movie is not as terrible as most Sci-Fi movies. I'm used to seeing gray CGI dots and the special effects of amateurs such as the close-up of fake blood that make it very clear that blood is a strawberry syrup or some other syrup variations. However, I thought I had seen all the low levels that a science fiction channel could reach. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in a rubbery sock with a drink? Those are the main alien vampires in this film. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubber sock dolls. A hand comes from the victim's veins, and Vampire Hunter's vampire can speak to these Sock rubber dolls in the Transylvanian. How to learn exotic vampires Transylvania? And not Transylvania in Romania? So should not they speak Romanian? Why do some small town have their own language? If you can suspend the reflex and bypass the rubber-speaking socks that move clearly inside the heads of aliens, then you have to deal with other alien vampires. There are "leather facades" who love to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are just those ugly little ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the valley girls, the nuisances and their friends who traitors humans and sneak into space colonies so they can sabotage the defense systems so that these vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third degree of Network Network rejection that makes up this team of angry heroes stereotypes that are constantly fighting among themselves. Why should almost every Sci-Fi movie use leading characters that are annoying, abrasive, raw, or completely unfriendly? I found myself hoping to win the rubber socks that you speak.
