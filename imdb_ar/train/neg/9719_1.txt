Umm, please forgive me, but were not more than half of the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying several times to escape. He breaks the parole and relentlessly follows Inspector Jaffert. Along the way there are many characters that were not in this version. It is noteworthy that Fantine, Cozette, M & M. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character of the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to figure out how it was related in any way to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
