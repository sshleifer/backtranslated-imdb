Six guy companies, about to be sent home and unloaded, drunk and sneaked into a worship meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded shapes, a male dancer pretends to be fighting. Behind them, on the altar, a woven basket opens and a painted drawing appears and begins to mimic a snake, and eventually one of the dancers bites on the neck. Wearing a imitation snake in some body wide looking socks. (This is definitely a vampire imitation of females). A member of the sect who infiltrated the secret meeting repeatedly warned the six men that ceremonies should not be boycotted, and certainly, photographs should not be taken or they would be caught. Down and killed. Of course, GIs captures a flash image, and sends members of the sect to an angry hysteria, stealing a basket containing "Snake" and escaping with her on an Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the men, the most aggressive and few, dies from the cobra bite on the neck, although no one can explain how the serpent arrived at his hospital room. <br /> <br /> Going back to New York, it all seems fairly old news when the men settle down in their civic life, keeping their ties with each other. Their jobs range from bowling alley manager (David Jansen) to graduate student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a beautiful blond girl friend. Kelly is a rather reckless woman minister. But they all live well enough and seem to be all happy. <br /> <br /> Then a mysterious dark woman emerges (Phith Domeerg) and Marshall Thompson picks up her admiration and hints at the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what's going on. First Janssen is terrified of the shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly gets a visit from Dumberg. There is something that frightens him very much as he falls out of the window and dies in the fall on the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin questioning what the viewer already knows - that Dumerij is related to deaths. They also think they may turn into Cobra, that's the case. Dobson faces his doubts and confirms his point of view. <br /> <br /> By this time, Long and Thompson have become quite confused, especially Thompson, who loves Domerge and has found herself attracted to him. , Although he must explain to her what is "love". Did not matter. A reckless final attack by a Cobra woman against a long-girl girlfriend - not one of the six original culprits - Thompson must throw the serpent out of the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to the Domergue body. End. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most of the questions raised by the plot. I will only mention one of the most prosaic in transit. Who paid for the Domergue fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who pays her utility bills at the hotel? Who paid for her amazing wardrobe? How do you speak American English well? What the hell is going on? The writers and directors have clearly seen some of Fall Luton's modest horror films, and although not much effort has been made in this production, they have shamelessly stolen some of Luton's tricks. In Luton's Cat People, for example, a woman turns into a black leopard, but with one exception, the threat is always in the shadows and more frightening. Most transitions here use shadows as well, but unlike Lewton, the shadows are clumsy and not ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also accidentally used what he called "buses". Luton's first bus was a bus. A potential victim is rushing alone through the dark tunnels in Central Park with only a linear voice. Something or someone is following it. It freezes with fear under the street lamp. Something steals the branches of the bushes above it. She looks up. There is a loud noisy noises that make your hair straight. It's a bus that uses air brakes to stop. The producers used at least two buses in this film and did not reach anything. For example, a distracted man walks through a crossroads, and there is a sudden clatter in a truck that nearly blows him. There is no preparation for killers. It is packed with horns for shoes. <br /> <br /> I do not care much about films that perpetuate stereotypes of the snake such as the big, ugly, toxic and few. In fact, there are no soft snakes, mostly harmless, many of them unusually beautiful. Moreover, she is more feminine than the masculine in her evil movements and her wavy approach to goals. Want reptile code for masculinity? Try a racer of six lines. It's a really fast orchid. When you see something you eat, they rush and swallow it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to watch some good, low-budget movies, do not worry. Look for "The Cat People" or another small Lewton masterpiece, which is a clear copy.
