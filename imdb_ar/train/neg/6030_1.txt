Well, now, I know there are millions of Americans who believe in love: that moment when all the people born again in Christ will be rushed to meet God, and the rest of humanity will be left to die in pandemics and fire. And the psoriasis of psoriasis where the Antichrist fights with Jesus (in an unusually warlike situation). I know books were a best-seller. . Of the faithful, anyway. I do not mean disrespect for all that. <br /> <br /> But I must say, they packed this movie into a bag and beat it with the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Oh really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need to be revived. If you have watched this movie, it is likely that you read the book. I may be one of the only people on earth who actually saw this in order to experience a very bad move, and I was not disappointed. Especially by Kirk Cameron, the little Griffin, the creeping "growth ache," who came into this show, founded Christ, and decided that the show would reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to dogs, but now you can be happy because you're spreading the word of God in the movies very badly, they do not even make it a theatrical release. Well, that's not quite true: I think this is the only movie ever produced on DVD FIRST, with a free movie coupon when it was put on for a short time in cinemas! I still have the coupon! How many people assume their backs? I do not know about you, but did not come to my city. Of course, I live in New York City, where we atheist liberals sit around pages torn from the Gospels and use them to wrap the joints. So there you go. In fact, I will bet on three million people on Manhattan Island, and no one will be ruined. <br /> <br /> Check out the supplementary material on the DVD, where you'll learn the behind-the-scenes details of these movies. . Both CAST and CREW must have the same religious mentality. They do not go straight out and say this, but they listen closely to what filmmakers say. It's like a bunch of people gathered together to produce a pod movie. How did this creep? Honestly, these things only bode well, do not they? Can you imagine anyone who does not participate at the end of the world that you see this, slapping his forehead and saying, "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I get saved PRONTO!" Anyway, I'm hooked. I must see the rest of the films of these Christian failures, especially those with Gary Busey, which I believe to be trappulation. At least Busey has an excuse to take the part .. He broke his head on some sidewalks when his motorcycle crashed. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and something else. What are all the shots of innocent poor dogs whispering, the leagues are useless on the ground, because their owners are summoned to paradise? What's up with that? Are we supposed to be upset about dogs, and if we do, what do we do from God? Are not people IRK that there is no place in paradise for a man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason because I do not know. Happy evening and good luck.
