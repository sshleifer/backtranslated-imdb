I enjoy watching western movies but this film takes biscuits. Scenario and dialogue is laughable. The acting was awful, where did they come from? The music was good I have to say. Luckily I did not buy or rent the film, but it has now been disposed of. <br /> <br /> I got ready at first when the stranger (Martin Shin) began to tell his story. I must admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong fired his finger on Tex and ordered him to train for 40 years to reach his league. But that's where everything went pear shape after that. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would improve, and it did not happen.
