Team Woody Harrison and Wesley Snipes as a team in the basketball game. Well, it looks so good there. It leaves plenty of space for good comedy and a good story. But such an event did not happen in the next boring minutes of this pathetic attempt at a film. This film became superfluous, backward, and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite TV shows for characters, Woody of Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this film. But after seeing his "acting performance" he came to the conclusion that he must continue to play the country's stupid cheers. His representation was as dull and poor as the film. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I liked movies with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed other work in her career was that she was not a major character and did not have a lot of talk lines. But now White Men can not jump, she has become a pivotal figure with many lines, which means that the audience has to endure its incredibly disturbing and shocking voice. So after watching this movie (term loosely used) and hearing Rosie Perez for more than appreciation, I can now say that I am a white man and I am preparing to jump. . . Off the twenty story apartment building.
