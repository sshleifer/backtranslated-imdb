The film is really very bad, with a few good moments or good qualities. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the pregnant Linda Blair, who runs out of corridors to escape what may be monsters or people with the playground, unsure. She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is too pregnant. The degree of their load varies greatly during the film. <br /> <br /> She is an annoying little boy and perhaps a backward woman who may have thought her son was traveling to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most outrageous boys to put in their movies! On the island already David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (know how Germans say they love Hasselhoff ...). It takes pictures, and it translates into a slow German book about witches, I think. <br /> <br /> As the elderly couple travels to the island they bought it, a real estate agent, and a woman they thought were their daughter. She was obviously an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy were the children of the older couple. I think they all traveled to the island together, but it seems Linda was the boy away from the rest (maybe they were photographed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel looks stylish, certainly externally, but not used for any great impact. An old woman with bad makeup and a black cloak continues to appear on the boy and sometimes chants in German, eventually recording him on the tape recorder of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> People start killing, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. Some of these scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the film. Although the version you saw said it was not glued on the cover of the case, the death of a person whose veins appear to have been broken has apparently been cut off. A large part of the scene shows other avatar reactions, so we do not see anything ourselves. Shaggy scenery is a scene in which a man or demon badly injured the chaos in the mouth to rape someone. He looked very bad. There is a very bad and funny scene owned by Linda Blair. I wish that a horror film would have attached it to her. They did an original work through her role, leaving her leaving the evil pursuer behind her (except for the annual terror conventions). <br /> <br /> In the West, largely Italian, the tradition of allegation as a sequel to something unrelated to it, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. It is supposed to be a supplement to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) is also a better film than this one). La Casa 1 and 2 The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again have nothing to do with magic and La Casa 3 (and much better than these). There is also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to want to be part of the fake La Casa series and House House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How is the horror film shown? It was not really, it claimed to be a sequel, and therefore required to enter the real string to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Curiously, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt so far?
