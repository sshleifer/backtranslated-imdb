Some vandals who were not in the film were included. <br /> <br /> From real life experiences, this film has continued to be frustrating from the start. I am currently on my second trip to Iraq as a footman. This film has nothing to happen in real life events. From the very beginning, for example: the explosive vehicle, the explosive ordnance disposal elements are flowing unaccompanied solo, the sergeant from the VBC explosives team, after the sleeves rolled all the time in the anti-dumping units, where I had to name it on version 2 Haji dollar, scene sniper. The list will continue, however, it is not necessary to list the erroneous things that occur with a two-minute period before more incorrect things; this point has been made clear. <br /> <br /> This film is directed at people and critics to see that they have no understanding or experience in deployments or the army. <br /> <br /> People with a military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed by the inaccuracy.
