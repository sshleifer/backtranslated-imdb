I read the Running Man of Kings books as a Bachman and I felt the main character of John and his family. This movie could have been much more. the problem? He was appointed during the Big Movie Madness. I watched the movie and I felt pain during everything. I did not feel personal and less so for his case. Yes she had funny scenes (or funny) although I think he did not save the film in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the peak and the fire in John's heart during his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a low number. Maybe this was not a drop if I did not read the book.
