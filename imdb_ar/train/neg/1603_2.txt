If this is not for Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the ignorant stones, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot about a 10-year high school reunion, which takes place in a deserted, abandoned high school (looks like a pillar of a low-intensity panic attack in the 1950s), is centered on a very painful joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes is very much in love with his characters, with one student killed in addition to the lunch lady (Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We have been led to believe that the Muqrin is killed, but you do not see anything explosive! This is a terrible film that followed the downward spiral of the National Lampoon during the 1980s and 1990s.
