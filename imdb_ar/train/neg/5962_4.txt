Paul Naschy made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from good garbage to inaccessible. Unfortunately, horror rises from the grave closer to the latter. The plot is just your middle story about witch or magician or (as here), who is executed - but not before swearing revenge from those who did it ... etc, then we get checked one thing leads to another, and soon the magician returns Which was executed to infinity again. The plot is painfully slow and boring and the film continues to no avail. Characters emerge from diatribe novels and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me must adhere to the representation because the dialogue is too tacky, and only works to make the film more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who directed Naschy in the film Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curve of the Devil, provides a boring trend here, and who loves dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes such comic films have a certain charm; but the horror rises from the grave does not have it. This is a dull boring film that has little or nothing in the way of attention.
