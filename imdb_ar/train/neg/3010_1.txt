Holy St. This God was awful. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I would spend a lot of time at the Oedipus Rex Palace. dear God. This movie is not worth more credit than anything done by the middle school film buff. Please save your money, this film can offer you something. Unless you enjoy side-trips and sleep in cinemas. You know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things enjoyable. You'll be the only one there anyway. F @ Cliche this slideshow. <br /> <br /> Ye Be Warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend not to see this. <br /> <br /> Hello. <br /> <br /> How are you? <br /> <br /> I am very good. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this day? <br /> <br /> I'm here. <br /> <br /> This comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie. This sad.
