I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the plane was the coolest thing I've ever seen. It was very high tech it's time. It can expel enemy fire, execute all kinds of acrobatics in the air, and destroy almost anything. Now I go back and see it today and am amazed at how bad this show really is. The team members are hardly hooded, there are lots of cheese moments, and the fighting scenes look incredibly fake. Almost every end has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of low-quality stock footage granular. So many of the shots from the Vietnam War are showing. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has essentially the same theme as the Knight Rider, except that the favorite car to fight crime is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching some episodes, I found myself feeling completely bored. However, I love theme music.
