As a person who admired the scenes and was really fascinated by this fantastic real story, I was optimistic in this film, but there are many obstacles to the way the good story should have been. THE BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role here is boring as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The obnoxious dialogue and lovely Katharine Harold is a real mouth rubbish. From what I read, there were several directors who replaced each other in this film, which is very bad. You can say things are not true with the story. I could not take part in the portrayal of Williams' treatment of Cooper as well. It should have been wonderful, but it was not in this film. It is also a sad comment that someone who commits a crime is a "popular hero," but I admit that I have also finished rooting this man. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain of the scene, from lush green forests in Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this film re-made and accomplished better, because it is a unique story.
