from where we start? Special effects should be named special flaws, when the director shouted "do" I think he also referred to the actors to perform the worst performance they can think of. He may have been upset by the producers and wanted to make sure they would not recover one cent of their investments and that the work would be a case study of how a film would not be produced. Or perhaps he hated the arts school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not allow him to do so. <br /> <br /> The only thing certain that everyone who employs him in the future is that he loves him (thus his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous references.
