I'm watching it now on the pink color (Serbia TV Station) and I have to say that this is nonsense. Shallow, without representation, very dirty effects, who made this series? <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt for studios to make more money on the success of the film. Okay. The film was great in 1994 when it was screened. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes, you can see how strange the lines are in the characters' speech. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write it, was that someone soon in the studio? This is not science fiction. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, sucking the string.
