I did not think it would be possible for Joe without Becker to make a bad film like "Mitchell" the bad smell, but that movie worked. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this if you love Joe Don Becker's work much better. But, if you want to watch young players sweating, and in fact, fight gun battles, you'll love this movie.
