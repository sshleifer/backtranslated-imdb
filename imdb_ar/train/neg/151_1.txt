This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature of this movie is that the next time people ask me about the worst vampire film I've ever seen, I'll have an appropriate response. <br /> I think it was shot at 35mm so it is already tacky like hell. I did not bother commenting, but I noticed that some fans (possibly connected to the film) claimed that this was the best film since Matrix. Let me expose myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the film. Everything screams tacky. The actress is ugly. The dance design battle is the worst I have ever seen. The scenes of fighting are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl fluttering in her arms in a helpless circle and making weak kicks that do not hurt the cat. The director obviously pulled people out of the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know the director did not have a big budget for the film but better films are still being produced with a smaller budget. It is unforgivable.
