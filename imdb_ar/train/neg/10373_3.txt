This is one of those movies where I could only sit once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors are fine. The problem is in the script, dialog box, direction, editing, groups, and special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really squeaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, and WC. Can not recognize the fields and Cary Grant (there are faces I cried for recognition was not coming). The film is only congruent with no cohesion. Much of the spirit of Lewis Carroll and humor and continuity are missing. Unfortunately! It is a wonderful book. I would recommend Disney version 1951.
