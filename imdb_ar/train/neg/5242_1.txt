Well, I hated it, and I despised a 40-year-old virgin, and this little jewel is a worthless film of waste. Do yourself a favor, and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this film, and after my 18 year old son explained to me the DVD cover, I liked "I do not like this movie", but by his insistence, I decided to try it, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> After about two minutes of playing the movie, I turned it off. It's just disgusting. Any respectable person will be insulted by filth in this film. Call me old-fashioned, but I wash your hand covered with bean juice in the face of your friend so you know that you "got some" exceeded indecency, in my opinion. Yes, that's how this rotten little movie starts, and I can only imagine it getting worse from there. Another real winner of Mr. Rudd. I bet he is proud of punch. Imagine if you could get worthless roles just like you do, can you stay in the movies? Although pay, I do not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. Next time will.
