I've seen anime but I'm not a hard die fan. I do not read the manga. I say this because many reviewers who are waxing about this movie seem to have this background. I have seen St. John's Plant, and although it is not a masterpiece in any way of fantasy, it has led me to pick up the "Shinobi", especially since everyone loves them. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw him this afternoon, and I fought very hard to follow him. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow water scenes, autumn leaves on the trees, and even blink CGI eye - majestic. I loved the falcon, costumes, and even some fighting scenes, but overall it was as dull as dirt. <br /> <br /> It looked as if someone had taken "Romeo and Juliet" - remember the translation they had passed star lovers - and threw some "X-Men" for good measure. Two characters divide the powers of Wolverine - the man wearing the bear's costume had claws and the gray-haired man had the ability to heal himself. Then you have a girl who has a venom kiss - this is poison ivy (from Batman). Why do these women give these dumb powers? A poisonous girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Man, this is some great power for you. And the other girl, can create mistakes from this yellow dust that sticks to her hands. The other woman, a cross-lover, has the power of hypnotic stare. wow. <br /> <br /> I reached somewhat at the end of the movie, by redirecting it quickly, and I saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make this mistake. May share similar ends, but this is where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are produced by an experienced film director. <br /> <br /> I say avoid this film unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
