This clear pilot of a non-productive TV series features a young Canadian actress Cherie Appleby as a memoryless with some incredible powers that must be used when the demon is left the man who shaves the world. The CGI is equal to the TV function, and Appleby is fine as a memory loss factor, but it is difficult to swallow as a supernatural event. The face of the familiar TV, Richard Burgey, is the Appleby's guide, but he can not do anything to lift the flight above the middle level. We see a lot of cartoon flying demon from the beginning, a bad sign. The scenes in which Burgee Appleby trains for the battle are laughable. It's a bad version of similar scenes in many other films, most notably REMO WILLIAMS.
