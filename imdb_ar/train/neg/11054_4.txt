I find her sad and inspiring because the writing team behind Hollywood movies such as Ediana Indiana Jones, The Temple of Death, American Graphite and Howard The Duke will start their career with a horror film of low-budget exploitation like this. Perhaps as evidence of the talent that will give Willard Hock and Gloria Katz the nomination of Oscar later in their careers, the Messiah of Evil may be possible, but unfortunately becomes quite frustrating because the ingenuity of filmmaking can not be mobilized. <br /> <br /> The hypothesis involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search of her father, a painter who has been lost in a short time. It does not take long for this fragmentary story to give up all hope and sink into a disorganized mess - for a while it works so admirably well that it begins to think that the Antichrist may need evil to recover from the 1970s gutter As an example of the mysterious artistic horror. <br /> <br /> Non-Sri Lankan infiltrators continue to stumble while her daughter stumbles on a young couple in a hotel room planted in the city to search for locals. The Legend of "Moon of Blood", an alcoholic and semi-insanity (played by Elisha Cook, the great son in the best scene in the film) who warns her of her father to be found dead in an alley eaten by dogs shortly afterwards, the blind old lady who owns the local art gallery and She unwittingly removed all the paintings of her father from the store and last but not least, Albino's underdeveloped, assassin, eating squirrel. <br /> <br /> Part of the magic of the film is precisely this bran d of surrealistic technical bargaining that defies logic and genre conventions at every step on the road. While it is clear with Lynch that they are the mark of the talented creator, with the limits of Christ between "intentional" and "unintended" evil and "did not really expect to come out this way but this is good enough - WRAP SCENE" a hopeless obliteration. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a harmful, feverish, awareness-raising way, one coming from her daughter as she wanders around to look for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his memoirs. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about the image of the Living Dead, the "Christ of Evil" is different and willing - at least with the current presuppositions of what is supposed to be a zombie film. The origin of the dead living here is a 100-year-old curse, given to his mysterious "mysterious dark" town that came from the woods someday. In the meantime, Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumer criticism in a supermarket scene that deals with meat that precedes the dawn of the dead for many years (you can actually hear the MST3K line: "The man died, his capitalist food is just the remains of the cans") and a similar scene, In a movie theater. <br /> <br /> I think generally that surrealism works in fine doses and well thought out - how can tampering with work if it is not completely hidden inside? Hyuck seems to have smudged it completely on the image and by doing so skips over When the pino picks up, for example, a girl makes her way into the town and eats Jaba is in front of her, you can imagine that the director is deliberately winking in the audience, amused and satisfied with his sheep. <br /> <br /> The general level of filmmaking is also low - halfway down, the pace becomes confused and the story becomes tiring. In addition, the uneven editing, the average representation, and the general inability of Hyuck to capture the true atmosphere - the empty streets in the coastal city are being misused criminally - and I will present a Christian under a "missed opportunity", but no The millers still find enough appreciation - even though they are not terribly bleak Special, or trivial or flimsy.
