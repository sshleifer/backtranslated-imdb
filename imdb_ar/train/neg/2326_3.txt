Dr. Mourred Marab. I would not recommend anyone adult or child to see this unless they are already murderous killers already. There is a lot of filth in this film hurts me yes. Talking about the eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against the background of the stars. Only Satan himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. I have rented every copy I can make from local video stores and crushed it with a 5 pound steel. This film must remain closed in a cellar behind the fourth dimension with all the other disgusting monsters of hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest if you want some outrageous entertainment, go and hire All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. Those films deserve to be seen. If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you need to see Dr. Murdred.
