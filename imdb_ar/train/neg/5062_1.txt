This film is strange. Best of all, it's a weird "freakin '." I can give you a summary of the plot, or some analysis, but I'll take it as a waste of your time.All anyone needs to know about this film is two little sisters, incest relationship, murder, mutilation, infatuation At the end of the film, you feel like you need to go for a shower to wash the dirt yourself, but not in a good way like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club." It seems like you're a teenager (or high school student because I'm still a teenager) What you A: I wish you did not do, and B: I hope that your parents are the Lord of the good heaven and earth that your parents do not know about I recommend that instead of distorting your mind and watching a piece of filthy filth, you have to waste your time on something less horrible and watch Kazam (yes, the best view of Kazam instead of Deadly Maids). In it what you want).
