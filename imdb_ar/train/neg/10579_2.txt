According to IMDb Takashi Miike's Master of Horror-sector, Imprint was banned in the United States. So I thought I was translating the Swedish review I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> It was hard to have any kind of expectations from the episode Ichi The Killer-Director Takashi Miike in the Masters of Horror series. The Imprint DVD cover looks very good. <br /> <br /> The story often takes place in a distant Japanese bordello, sometime during the 19th century, recounting the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind and promised to return to. Tired and depressed up to the bordello, hoping that this is the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a distorted and quiet girl, knows about Komomo, and the desperate man tells her where she is and what happened to her since he left. The story you tell is as unfortunate as it is difficult to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was how unusual it was for Japanese actors to speak fluent American - English. But I'll leave it at that, it's not a big deal. What a big problem but how miserable was the rest of it. The Miike story moves so slowly that I could not help looking at my watch several times in 63 minutes. The scene of the extended scene, somewhere somewhere in the middle of the film, was not too excited - and so blatant - that this scene did not become interesting. I felt that it was violent just for the violence itself - without a sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that aroused any kind of emotion on my side were the images of the bloody embryos rolling down the bottom of the fast-flowing water ... and with all honesty, the only feelings they aroused were disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist Billy Drago plays the role of a journalist who searches for the love he left behind. For me, he is more than forgetting Frank Nieti-Al Capones, the killer of Whitaclad in Brian De Palmas (1987). I have always found that Dragoos's portrayal of Nieti was very glacial (I mean it in a good way) and maybe that's why I was almost upset when I found it very terrible (not in a good way) in this one. His actions seem to flow between the absence of feelings or sympathy of any kind with too many extreme offers. When he assumes that his personality is interacting with the horrible things Komomo was exposed to you are sitting on the couch, twisting and turning in an attempt to escape from the terrible representation that Drago put up. I am grateful that most of the story is told by Yuki Kudo (Memoirs of Gisha, 2005), who plays the role of a deformed whore. <br /> <br /> The end is likely to be suffocating, perhaps even rebellious and horrible, but I found it kind of ... you know ... "Blah" (I looked back at my watch for the thousandth time, I just wish that Ending crappy loop). It may have finally caused me to smile a bit, but that's just because I could not think of an episode of Red Dwarf, the upside weights of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, with eyes attached to them that seem like foreigners ... Lucky, if I saw this episode and now decided to see the imprint, you'll forever spoil the end pictures for you. <br /> <br /> My first idea, when the end fingerprint ended, was the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it, is hearing the theme of Edward Shermore's main title (the same music that I think is used in every episode of this series ), This - if anything - is a big friggin warning, do not you think? <br /> <br /> One can point to fashion design, by Michiko Kitamura, and say that at least there is something that is not lacking in style and elegance. But there are plenty of movies and other television programs that are much better in showing off " Fashion Geisha "Japanese. This is only inferior and I am disappointed. The masters of Takashi Miki of the horror ring boring, uninspiring and useless. In other words; it's really, really bad!
