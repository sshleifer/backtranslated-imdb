There is absolutely nothing to recover this film. They took a flimsy story, abused it, mistook it, misled it. A bad dialogue has been done badly in a tortuous story. <br /> <br /> Just as bad as art fails, it fails worse than trade. Which could have been the target market for this. What is the age group? What is the interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone must make a film about how this film is made and why. I will pay for it. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this is classified with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... My Choices are the 3 most very bad films I have ever seen in my life. Conversation with VanDamme forever. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how can you take this and make it worse? I can not think of one way.
