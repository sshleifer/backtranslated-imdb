The main reason for writing this review is that I found a "re-examination" in a wonderful play and a movie worthy of 1972, an awesome cinematic experience. If I could save someone from watching it, we would have done something good. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent, all of which gets worse. Kenneth Prana agrees to a bunch of ugly and stingy remarks. The film is filmed from each detached and self-centered angle. See the reflections of the representatives in stainless steel, security screens, shots of their heads from 200 feet above, close-up shots of the eyes, chin, and so on. The script, by the Nobel laureate, offers long periods of unpleasant gay joking, being forged by the parties, .... I think? Given the personality of "twists", how do I know? The very characters, richly painted, are brass and unsympathetic. The runtime was cut for an hour, which is either the real or mild problem that the manager did for us. Actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing can be believed or done remotely. Good Lou is out of the top more than Ken, but as the approved product, he must have been blessed by Prana. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this ugly to take a look at, an unconvincing shell of a previous classic. Why was it so made ?? The paid audience spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A vanity piece of action that fails at every turn.
