This so-called prequel is just a bad remake of a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical as in most texts. I loved the book which is based on, I loved the first film, but I will not disturb the third film. The useless joking between the two main characters in the previous group was entirely predictable and non-original, and ... I can not say how bad the film is. If you do not want to take my words for it, just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review saying "If you like the first review, you'll want a second review" and the only reason is that the movie is exactly the same movie! Although the plot is not so good. They took a lot of lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
