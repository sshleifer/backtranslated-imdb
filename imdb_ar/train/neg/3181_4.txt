This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans look forward to within half an hour of Tommy Medley are lost or overlooked: On Christmas, they did not show Daltrey's cries after the line "Tommy does not know what it is today .." ", showed almost Townsend Guitar shots * No * in Pinball Wizard , There were extra group shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We Not Gonna Take It, they robbed us of almost every shot of the guitar strings. It's a very frustrating movie to watch, and I do not know if the director Murray Lerner is not from the band. Fans of "or", or worse for him at least, if he is a "fan" and these are all * eight * cameras that can be made for him.Thanks to this there are some rare numbers before Tommy, The preferences were very well filmed, and sometimes the editing was great.This may be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you do not expect Tommy.The overall sound was below average in the broadcast you watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD .
