Do not worry about "those" very much, but if there is a film that deserves this attention, it is a "gas"! It is self-crap that reaches some M * A * S * H ​​atmosphere and falls completely on her face in an attempt. <br /> <br /> I see what Kurman was walking on - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's non-lethal role in the original film version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in "Whiffs" - Find it here at IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approached the copper ring with "Whiffs" more than Corman did with "Gas!" But did not get there. None of these films came close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gas!"? What not? No one is really approaching acting at a higher level than secondary stage plays. Production values ​​are stinky. Another person here mentioned the miraculously refurbished headlights on a car escape, and there is a lot of this lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way that is supposed in this film, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" He actually put me to sleep. It's not a sure cure for insomnia, but it's really close. On the cinematography scale, "Gas!" Is located somewhere between "last year in Marinbad" and the new George Clooney of "Solaris" (which was itself more remarkable than the boring original Musfilm, although this studio seems unusual for the idea of ​​keeping public attention through editing the wise). The wise modification would have destroyed "gas!" For about twenty minutes. The result would be useless, but not more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they have great quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. do not waste your time. It's not too bad.
