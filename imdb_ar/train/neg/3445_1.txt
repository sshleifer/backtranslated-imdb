When Kevin gets his dead uncle's boat as a gift, five friends invite him to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. During the trip, they drink alcohol, have sex and play games, telling each of them their greatest fear. Later Kevin sank into the open sea, stopped the engine, and became haunted and killed by their deepest fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, my son, my daughter and three other friends joined to see "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes in a row, the group gave up watching this virtuous and boring amateur piece, and we wanted to see another film. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this click to see how bad it was, and it was better to go to sleep. The blurred story contains cinematic works and horrible cameras, with a team likely to be acting as actors and actresses. In the end, this is a bad project for the film school. The terrifying and terrifying scenario appears to be an ironic development in the end, in fact a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is about. Was the girl crazy and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If this is true, is their girlfriend back at the end of her madness? One voice. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Journey to Death")
