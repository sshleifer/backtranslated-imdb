After being a great admirer of T.V's ten minutes of "Stella Street", I waited for this film to stir up and watch. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was horrified that all the masks and linings were lifted directly from the TV episodes and were delivered with less enthusiasm and a humorous timing, if the actors told them once and could not bother them to tell them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated because I broke away from my hard earned money to watch the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * The plot begins with the Stella Street (regular English) street in Surrey), gradually inhabited by "some of the most famous people from the theater and screen of the last 40 years," including Michael Keane, Al Pacino , Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up being a full-fledged domestic delinquent, forced to live like tram people and ordinary working-class people. There are some nice moments, but in general, writers can take an interesting idea and make it very boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In T.V episodes, all characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including the female), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the actors. I think this was a mistake. Her acting was not funny, and she felt that her characters were included in the story just to give her something. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of Stella Street episodes, you may find this movie amusing. But if you're a fan, I think you might walk away feeling cheated. 10/04
