The undeniable, undeniable real crime film that mysterious actor Jeremy Reiner is waging on his way through the starring role of Jeffrey Dummer, who was easily one of the serial killers of the last century. The film "Dahmer", released directly into the video in early 2003, was released in a noisy, full of bloodless and vicious, and a dramatic clown about the real crime that does not really turn out to be the same savage brutality of the late mass murderer. Like it had a perfectly good potential to do! But what you do, trying to do for reasons unknown to me is to evoke a kind of empathy in the scenes of the man by portraying him as the only loser who suffers from emotional and savage homosexuality who was not simply seen to "love in all the wrong places instead of the cold, Overall, "Dahmer" for 2003 is a game that real crime aficionados can go through everywhere because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst of the series' deadly autobiography! It's more sad than other trash Compassionate and exploitative like the video "Gac y "," Bundy "," Ed Gein "and" Night Stalker "! (Turkey - zero stars)
