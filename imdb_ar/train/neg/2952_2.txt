From watching the trailer only to Theodore Rex, you might think this is a bad cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a man wearing a dinosaur costume. This is true, but this is often a futuristic story, much like Batman forever with her style in the direction and designs of strange characters. It was marketed incorrectly, and was supposed to be marketed as a futuristic story, rather than just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not the movie has been marketed, it is still a terrible film. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life with amazing technology, talking and walking like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur investigator not taken seriously, but after killing dinosaurs, he gave the case to work on them, but he must be a partner for the most powerful policeman of them all, Katie Coltran (Wobi Goldberg). It is up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it is up to the public to stay awake long enough to make it through this volatile piece. <br /> <br /> Teddy begins the picture as a normal character, but in the end it is unbearable to listen to him. For some reason besides being an investigator, he is also a bad comedy actor and a bad stunt. He does imitate people and famous accents, and he has some really awful lines. Wobbie blames him and says: "It's not a bugger!" Wonderful! What an immature childish line, even for a baby film of this caliber. The wifi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping that Teddy would bite her head for the whole length of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has never been known what it wants to be. When the viewer and future movement occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-motion scenes, characters try to be as funny as possible, leading only to straight-faced boredom. Motion scenes do not work because they are very strange and not violent enough, and as we mentioned earlier, comedy is just a bunch of jokes and carnage. Nothing works here at all. <br /> <br /> It seems that owning a dinosaur / bi-detective game is much like the original film, if nothing else. Both! This movie is a huge rupture of framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaurs with animation, and put them in the future, the exact same plot. Kill a man, kill a dinosaur. Dinosaurs and detectives solve murder, Toon and the detective solve the murder. The bad guys at Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and Weddings. The bad guys here are the person who looks like Christopher Lloyd and the guys who act just like a weasel. The club scene is imitated in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit plays the theater with dinosaurs. This is a huge offer for a much better movie! <br /> <br /> In general, it's a bad film, and it does not even deserve to be direct to VHS. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes. PG for light violence, language and raw humor.
