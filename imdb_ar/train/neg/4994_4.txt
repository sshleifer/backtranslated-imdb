Good movies are original movies, some leave a message or hold in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, I did not just think of a normal job when I saw this. It started good and was very entertaining, so why a bad review. Well in the end, the film has lost its credibility. The script was not cheesy at all, the procedure was not very special, but overall good, the acting was fine, more than adequate to meet my needs. But everything was ruined because the things that happened were above the top and left me feeling bad. They should have done more in making everything reliable and they would get 7 in the category of "Do not just think just plain work". In conclusion, if you know that you will get angry because things are happening in a completely illogical way: Do not see! Otherwise I say go ahead ...
