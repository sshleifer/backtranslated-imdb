No wonder that historian Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler's leading biography, who was originally the scientific adviser to this television film, broke up with him. The film historically only is very incorrect. The mistakes begin immediately when Hitler's father died at home, while he actually died in a bar. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact he actually moved to Munich in 1913. I can continue indefinitely. Hitler's childhood and youth are portrayed for a very short time, making it very difficult for people who are not historically familiar with the nature of this frustrated neurotic man. Important early people of the concert, such as friend Hitler's father Dietrich Eckart or "philosopher" in the party Alfred Rosenberg are completely missing. Ernest Hanfsting's description is very problematic. In the film, he is portrayed as a noble figure who almost vanquishes Hitler. It is clear that the script follows Hanfstaengl's own gloss on his personal view presented in his autobiography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem in the film is the portrayal of Hitler himself. He is characterized as a constantly unfriendly person, has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everyone. After watching the film, one wonders how this disgusting person could get any followers. As we all know, he was not the evil criminal of Hitler, it is natural to tempt every scriptwriter to portray Hitler as disgusting and not disgusting. But the facts are that in private it may be charming and very enjoyable. His companions did not follow him because he constantly shouted at them, but because they loved this strange man. In addition to all these historical errors, the film is well made, and the first-rate actors, site shots and production design give a sensible impression of the times.
