Just a lot of holes in this film to be fun and worst of all a strange ending like Hollywood that is totally out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not the spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You will also need to be thick-skinned for all types of politically correct tones. The conflict between whites and blacks was very intransigent and unilaterally. I did not understand why the writer behaved in the local black community in an unacceptable way. Was he / she trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A really weird film. Just see if you want to be bothered by the holes in the plot and want to discuss all the things that may or may not have been happening. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, however, photography and representation are excellent.
