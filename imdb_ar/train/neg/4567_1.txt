What a bad image of professional police officers are shown on TV in watching this alleged reality program. One can only hope that a reasonable factual doubt that leads to a probable cause leads to the overall circumstances involving a "stop", then "Pat Down" from the outside of the clothes, then be able to explain why the officer went to someone's pocket and regained And if he is not, he will be arrested in most places, even if the supervisor passes by. The report of the radio arrest warrant does not represent the actual existence of the connection unless the person who sent it has the original warrant. If the sender reads from a printed copy to the computer, this is good enough to stop, but that does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in effect. Since I have not seen one of CBS's Dis claimants (maybe I missed it), CBS may be in trouble.
