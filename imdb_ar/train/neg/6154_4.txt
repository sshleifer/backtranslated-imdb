A nice guy porti falls for a fat blonde. She loves him too, but not for the reasons you might think. The black comedy, which has not been seen by much of the writer Pat Proft, features very good performances by Joe Alaski and Donna Dixon, yet it does not affect permanently. It's just a quick attempt, led by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B comedy films, "eating" is somewhat like a better bet. There is definitely an entertaining group here; unfortunately, the picture has no place in the second move. Interesting experience, but inappropriate. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
