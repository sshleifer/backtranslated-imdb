I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary about what was happening in Puerto Rico. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... you could know what it would really be like to be Puerto Rico. As far as I know .... it was a New Yorker. Well anyway, I sat impatiently with my popcorn to watch. I realized after 10 minutes that my initial fear was right. Rosie Perez does not have much knowledge about how Puerto Rico is. This "documentary" is more on the one hand, a very personal account about what it looks like to be a New Yorker .. and all that entails. She (like most of the New Yorkers I know) has a lean, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How they can not .. live here). Yes, they are all proud. As it should be! But many do not know the ins and outs of real culture, history, political background or language for the most part. All this became very clear by participating in the Vieques case. Regardless of my personal opinion on this matter ... at least I know what the hell is the battle. There she was caught because of something she did not know very little .. She participated in it only because it was a "Puerto Rican cause" I do not really understand how not to feel embarrassed by recognizing it. For those of you who are not from Puerto Rico, please consider this as a partial calculation of a woman's journey to self discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as a gospel ... much of it is not true. Please consider the source. Rosie actress. Not a historian. This film is not and should not be, for other Norians, a base for their information. Instead, just step towards finding more information and learning and discussing what the reality is. Not only is the person coming from the eyes of this woman.
