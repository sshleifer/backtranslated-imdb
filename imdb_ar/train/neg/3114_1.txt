Trying to compare or represent this "twisting" as anything "Hitchcockian" is an all-out attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Weak story Weak script. <br /> <br /> No real suspense and suspense. I wait all this during the weakness of this film to get a great reward or even no reward ... You left thinking, what the heck was all about. <br /> <br /> Please, enough with the movement to make "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... Have you mentioned how poorly acting? Williams did a better job, such as Peter Pan and Murk. But those were more innocent times ...........
