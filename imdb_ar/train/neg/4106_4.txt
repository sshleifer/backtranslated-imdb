It was almost inconceivable that this film would be a bust, but I was already disappointed. Since I have been a filmmaker in Pekingba for years, I found that this DVD, which was greatly reduced, was on sale and I think it was worth the experience. The few opening and creative credits of Pekinpah fans are interwoven with humans and animals, but here we have a non-lethal noise for children playing in the schoolyard while planting a bomb. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the players travel, he and Duval, to their next task, Dauphal drops the bomb on Cannes, which was dated last night with sexually transmitted diseases, and was found only by sneezing through her bag while he was with her. The laughter that followed was wonderful, and he was clearly honored in the film Brian DiBalma, who was dressed in murder, at the expense of Angel Dickinson who did not last long. The problem with the Killer Elite is that after the credits are opened, the film is still stable. Even Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia has a stronger production value, a bold invitation to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. Use the Pekinpah credential as supplemental lecture material, but once finished, close the Killer Elite.
