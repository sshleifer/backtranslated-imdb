After hearing a lot about the Cracker 90 series without seeing any of them, I was looking forward to it eagerly. Surely a group of Jimmy McGovern and Robbie Coltran did not make a mistake. How wrong you are! <br /> <br /> The argument backed by repeated, repetitive and violent memories of the past was overwhelming. The production tried to be more modern, but the flashing boxes and even the baby line were angered. Robbie Coltran slept for two hours and came out with unexplained and unlikely "visions". The police were portrayed as two-dimensional idiots. As a result, tension never accumulated, and the next scene (without details of fear of spoilers) was so ridiculously bad a piece of television drama as I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see more of these things, but I'm going back to DVDs from the 1990's to see if they match their reputation.
