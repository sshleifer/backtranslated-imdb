To make a film that runs on real telegrams and trilogy "Star Wars" will impose even a great film maker .... Mr. Lucas is not the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> To portray the fall of a good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of light saber battles but there is a lack of edge because you already know which key characters remain in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) plays a very fast role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! <br /> <br /> The movie is not only captured with the running of advisor Jedi and has a single (extended) sequence when the lava falls
