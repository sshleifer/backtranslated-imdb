This movie was not bad - it was terrible. After I saw him, I felt the need to take a shower to get the filth out of me. There is a "gag" coming out of an elderly couple, it's not funny, but disgusting. Make-up monster was cool, but that's it. The errors of continuity alone will get angry - at least you. Editing is really bad. <br /> <br /> Anything else would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are in "bad movies", these movies are exceptional in their lack of confidence, I could not even make myself laugh at them. You have been warned.
