Basically, the husband-wife team of a dentist deals with their three daughters with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the representation is good, the music, although sometimes sudden and without direction, is very cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The dentist drops his wife behind the scenes in the opera before the show (she has a secondary role) and then goes back to give her something, but sees it with another man. The rest of the film deals with his anger at this episode, his visual hallucinations and emotional style (Denis Leary, a former patient) and his fear of facing his wife for fear of doing something about it. "I will not tell you the result, but let me say that the film does not go anywhere, and the end is like a geek." Motives are missing: Why do you betray him? He's a dentist, a decent appearance, a good father. Why do you want the marriage to continue despite all this? Who do you know? What is the purpose of all children vomiting? Where does this film go? The great performances of Campbell Scott and Hob Davis (and Dennis Leary as a comic relief) dissipate completely through this nonsense Who does not know whether he wants to be an American beauty or a family movie, the root canal is more interesting.
