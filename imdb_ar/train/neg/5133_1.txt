I had no real expectations of going to this movie and I am happy. Even if I expected to be bad, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? First, I think that 15% of the film was a steady set of shots in a dark forest field. Understand it. There are scares. I think the title of the "scapegoats" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing has been explained at all about the conflicts and supernatural events. There are many times that you left the WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, take the film itself very seriously. I am all for a B movie - with buckets of blood, women screaming, senseless violence, a result of a simple psychic mind or an old curse. But these films are often known as B-movies, but they boast of them, such as Dead Snow or Dead Dead 2. But this film seems oblivious to its nonsense. <br /> <br /> There must be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said that. If you get a horror film, you have to kill. If you want to get one hot and semi-hot girl, one of them will need to show at least some side tags. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrows" and poke yourself just in the eye. You will thank me.
