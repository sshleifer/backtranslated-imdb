As an Altman fan, I've been trying to get this movie for years, believing that with such a wonderful film, it should be at least fantastic at least marginally. <br /> <br /> A big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of the big artificial Altman forms, thrown randomly and improperly (or so you feel) hoping to be all gathered in the editing room. No. <br /> <br /> Maltin points out that this turkey is only distinguished for the first time by Alfre Woodard, who outperforms veterinarians around her. But otherwise, avoid at all costs. (Which is easy to do - has not been published on the video - to my knowledge - and the features of the cable by the frequency of the guilty Halle).
