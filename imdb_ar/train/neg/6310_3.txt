I watched this movie last night and I was a bit disappointed. Lots of "time facts" were extinguished. At the beginning of the film, the grandfather commented on this grandson and his friends about what they felt at 9-11. This film was supposed to be screened in 1994. Also, one of the grandchildren's friends was wearing an Iglesias Donovan McNab shirt. It has not been formulated yet. The story of the story was good, but the facts and reality of the timeframe were too far from the base, making the film look cowardly. My friend is a hungry reader of World War II books and souvenirs. I have rented this movie in the hope that it will be good. The acting was so. The dog was cute. But the way it was made made me feel happy because I paid only $ 4 to rent it for the $ 50 I could have seen in the theater. I hope that whoever reads this ever understands that I do not mean dissatisfaction with those who fought the war, but the facts and time frame should have been closely monitored.
