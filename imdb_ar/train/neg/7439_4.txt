A different look on horror. The design differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But from my American point of view, this was not a good film. The hero, Mary played by Anastasia Hill, was not a nice character and I had trouble identifying her. It was undesirable most of the time and was confused most of the time remaining. He also spent a lot of time moving them to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense accumulated. Once this happened, the size seemed to be used as a major impact that was more disturbing than anything else. It was originally understood more than most Direct-to-video movies and did not use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I recommend it for hire, but not for theater pioneers.
