William Lustig's follow-up to Maniac proves conclusively that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and the convincing Spinell performance, "Maniac" will not become the worship he has achieved. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with simple text thinking that explains everything to you and is predictable at every turn, and also modest performances by all actors. Out of the "deja vu" feeling that gave me this film, Lustig watched "Wish Death Wish" several times before making this! (* 1/2)
