I saw this movie when I was really young. It is by far one of the strangest films I have ever seen. Now, usually, I like exotic films, but this was very much. <br /> <br /> There is no big plot for the film. If anything, it starts like Toy Story, where the games are lively, and Raggedy Ann and Andy are on an adventure to save their new boyfriend Babette. From there, it follows madness. There is greed, Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a group of pirates singing the melodies of the review, all of which make the film stranger. Also, I can only feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too. It certainly did not help the film. <br /> <br /> Now, although I did not like this movie, there were some nice parts. I liked the camel song even though it was a song about loneliness, it had a friendly feeling. Then, there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were just ordinary nuts, Sir Leonard was the most exciting and perhaps the most entertaining. King Koo Koo had little dirt to make Dr. Evel like a dangerous villain. Also, there was Raggedy Andy, No Girl's Toy. It was certainly a good song for young boys who wanted to act hard. But honestly, even these things did not make the film better. (But remember that's just my point.) <br /> <br /> While I personally do not recommend this film, so I must admit it, but it contains its charming moments. You can watch it if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something "really" unusual.
