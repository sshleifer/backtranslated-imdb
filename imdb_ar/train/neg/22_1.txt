I watched this DVD in my friends' house and thought it was a Turkish action movie with some big names in Hollywood. Interested enough I decided to give him a chance later .. It was a difficult experience for me believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credit list, I thought, "We Turks are really sucking into the Hollywood film industry ... it's an insult to theft, the kind of hostage film." But then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish film; on the contrary was filmed literally in America with an American director and crew! That's what made me think again - how on earth can you convince names such as Michelle Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Fuslo to participate in such a project? With money maybe .. That made me think more .. How can you collect such a sum to offer them and are supposed to cast international? After that, all my reflections came and came to find the answer. Hire the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. If you're still having trouble adjusting your budget, when you write and direct the movie, you're trying to produce it or vice versa, I do not have any information about it. To sum up, this is not a bad film because everyone is very keen to present it. It makes you think - in my case - to meditate - and there are a lot of movies that do not even give that effect .. This film at least makes you think makes you wonder .. it leaves you Kufr .. then makes you wonder again ..
