I was a fan of science fiction in the 1950s, but that's not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural way to flick off the sci-fi bopper, the director was heavily dependent on the film. Obviously he was working without money, because the entire film is full of the oversized dialogue that lasts forever. I've never seen * a lot of deadly time in a movie. <br /> <br /> There may be less than 60 seconds of "point shots" in the entire film, and most people are involved in a lot of poorly written dialogue. It was interesting to see Steve M. And Anita Si together, but the good heavens ... How was he thought that anyone in his right mind would believe them as teenagers?
