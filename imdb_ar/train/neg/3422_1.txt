My dear, my dear. I started watching this without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader was to transport one unarmed man, and I expect him to be caught and run away with a missile. If that were so easy. I finally found a worse film than Plan 9 of Outer Space.
