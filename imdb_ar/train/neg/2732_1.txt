When I broadcast 'My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu' last season, I was happy. I thought the duke was doing something smart and unique about the concept of the clip. Instead of re-playing the clips, they re-run the jokes in a self-conscious way, and I really enjoyed them. <br /> <br /> It was really unfortunate that I was wrong. After one season, they surrendered to what almost all the comedies do, showing the clip ... It seems to have been compiled by a child with work experience. Dr. Cox's shaving head shows how lazy the editors are in putting it together, as he does not appear again until "My Long Goodbye" after 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig is a great effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was previously a well-constructed comic play. Who knows why she was locked up there, he seemed lazy and inappropriate, which reminds me (to a large extent) of the episodes that were broadcast over the past year. <br /> <br /> Three re-packed clips with background music is an extra DVD for a very rainy day, not a TV episode at peak times.
