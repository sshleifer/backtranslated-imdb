Do not make the amber. There are a lot of wrong things in this movie. It is a cliche, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There is a boring bad guy - Stellar gives another degree in his boring belt, Lucky Man - he is a wildly alleged person, but really just a fairly natural concern - which Aniston plays well, but he needs no effort to do so - fat, , And then the cliche group: an obsessive, obsessive Australian man, a confident young Hispanic, etc. Story: The starters are a bit unusual, but then go to any standard movie style, with each plot turning out as predictable as your knock knock knock average. The biggest problem was that Stellar's "evolution" did not seem to come from anything - like your average school play. The book knew where it started and where it ended, but they did not put enough stock in to tell the center correctly . Finally, the so-called "jokes" were only high versions of standard humor. There was a collective scene of organization, sweaty men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple truth about this film is that learning the meaning of the word "Chart" was the only good thing. Hamburg really had a dog dinner here, and perhaps the Stellar and Aniston paint had attracted viewers, but the remaining taste in the end was just as odd. <br /> <br /> Final comment: The film may have been awful, but Aniston still chose a better film among friends' classes between the infamous Kudrow "Marci X."
