The television version of "Twister" emits some leaks but remains able to stay in the maze. My sister bought this at Wal-Mart a few years ago when it was released and I saw it at that time and I thought it was fine. Later "Twister" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out (or was before? I think he was in 97) and did a better job overall. But the "cyclone" was more ridiculous fun. This is realistic with a message. It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a personal study with a low budget? <br /> <br /> John Schneider and Devon Sawa (the reason my sister bought it) star, Devon Sawa, who went to Wild America, Final Destination and Slackers, got a big break here. So somehow, I was one of the first people to see him really go. I do not know whether this is honor or shame, I have not seen how to act in modern films. <br /> <br /> "Night of the Twister" all depends on personal taste, as I said, depending on what you want from a Twister movie, or a low-budget personal study. "Hurricane Night" has the last. So you decide. <br /> <br /> Give it 2.5 / 5 ... <br /> <br /> - John Olmer
