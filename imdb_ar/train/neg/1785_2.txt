.... After seeing this heap of crap will not be surprised that it has not been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film by all accounts, but when you point out that it is one of the worst films named Stephen King in credits, you can begin to imagine how bad it is. The film begins with two characters staring at the mouth of terror: "Oh my God, what happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I do not know but they sure hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera moves out of the house where hundreds of cats have been raised and mutilated. Boy This guy is right, someone hates cats and with a discount like he should be a cop. Oh, wait a minute, he's a cop and when the movie starts with a cop making a very clear note you only know you'll see a bad film <br /> <br /> The reason that the SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it's very illogical and confusing. In the end we discover that the title monsters need the blood of the virgins to survive. Would not it be better to look for a virgin in the Bible belt in the Midwest instead of an American coastal town? Having said that, we know at least the motives of the monsters - this is the only thing we learn. Never learn how they can change the shape or ability to make the cars invisible and these jars with the end that seem to have been stolen from the termination device. Um Munster goes on about killing several policemen with her bare hands or blowing them with a police handgun! But if her monster is immune to the police force, why do creatures need to be able to change shape or become invisible? The demise of the creatures is equally sick as he was killed as a result of a collective attack of domestic cats. If they could be killed by cats, why did not the monsters kill all the cats that were lying around the park? There was a whole crowd of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought of killing them. I think this is so that the production team can come to an end. They started the film where my complaint lies. <br /> <br /> We have treated many scenes where famous horror directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make a veil. I think the reason is that whenever an unknown actor struggles with the script, they immediately decide that no matter why, they will not appear in such a bad film, so Stephen King had to contact his friends in horror to fill out the cast. This is how bad the SLEEPWALKERS <br /> <br /> * is unbelievable because it seems that it was not the worst line in the movie. The worst thing is that "this cat saved my life"
