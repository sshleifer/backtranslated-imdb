This film has been shown on local television here in South Africa recently and I thought I would warn even those who enjoy watching bad B movies that this is not amusing. The plot involves a couple visiting a house in the country. The problem is that most of the film, which was clearly filmed in the early 1970s, consists of very wide shots of people walking, in real time and very slowly, from A to B. This makes the film boring to the extreme and blood The expected bonus gur only will never happen. I'm really curious - how many people have actually seen this from start to finish?
