This film was given two stars only because Dominic Monaghan made an effort in acting. Everything else about this movie is very amateurish. Everything related to directing this film has been performed very poorly. The director should not only rethink what you do for the life career, but watch some movies. Since Dominique Monaghan is a very reliable actor, putting it in a movie of this kind makes him look awful. Whatever "actor" who played Jack's best friend should not interfere in front of the camera. I did not expect much from this little film, but perhaps more time and effort should be spent on characters and their surroundings. Do not waste your time or money in this movie (as I did), you will be very disappointed.
