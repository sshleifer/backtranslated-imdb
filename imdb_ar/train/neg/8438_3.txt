I think Laurel and Hardy are better than no Laurel and Hardy at all, but barely. It's sad that Fox has a big DVD version, exposing people who may not be familiar with L & H to their worst stuff than a classic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once again, the boys bear with a stupid romantic plot about the man who invented an invisible ray. He loves the daughter of the presidents, who hate him and prefer someone. It's unbelievable to think that the geniuses at Fox have thought that this is what L & H needs in their films. <br /> <br /> Without making pancakes, boys seem tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this picture are when they try to sneak out of the bedroom window at night and the somewhat strange scene where Robert Mitchum, being a bad guy at Noir, tries to sell Oliver Hardy's lock on Stan. <br /> Otherwise, this text is just chaos. Forget this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
