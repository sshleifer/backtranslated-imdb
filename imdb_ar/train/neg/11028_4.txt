Near the beginning, after the outsider, John Dillinger (Warren Oates), is found to be a paranoid rapist and other bandits from the 1930s are trapped in a farm house surrounded by the FBI. The second man in command, Milvin Borvis (Ben Johnson), who explores the positions, glues a cigar lit in his mouth, picks up two 0.4-inch automatic cars loaded, and chases the remote house alone. Explosion, explosion, explosion. Borvis leaves alone with the hostage, who died. All in a long shot. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated by stories like Red Riding Hood, it must be very attractive. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is stray. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his death dramatically. Multiple violations of civil law. Lots of shoots with Tommy guns and pistols. Blood is over. <br /> <br /> As history stinks. Few remember Milvin Borvis as a hero in the FBI, partly, I think, because of his name. Melvin Bourvis? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who launched Melvin Purvis because he was a competitor in the search for public interest. <br /> <br /> The image was written and directed by John Milius. He is the man who wrote in his contract that if any animals were shot and killed during one of his productions, he must be the designated shooter. Milius is a man, a maniac of firearms, who participated in the game Rough Riders of Teddy Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War screaming from Henry V - "St. Crespin's Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Sexy, yes, and the trash is complete. "I knew I would never take him alive, and I did not try too hard." That is, kill everyone and let God spawn them. <br /> <br /> You will only love her.
