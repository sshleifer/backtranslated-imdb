Dream home art veteran. Exaggerated, exaggerated, exaggerated. A combination of buzz that not only deserves the best picture of 1951 based on their own merits, but has been diminished by competition from the beginning. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; you name it if you go out in 51, it is better than this exciting game. Ballet Closing is a claptrap for the intellectual crowd, misplaced in the wrong film. Few of the actors in their time were less capable (in acting) or less attractive than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 is worse than 51 (I've seen 201 films), and among the worst 5 winners are the Oscar for photos.
