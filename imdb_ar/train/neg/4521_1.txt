Every film Biker Movie must consist of the worst films ever produced. This offers a lot of fighting, huge amounts of blood, bikers who fight Indians, and the town of huts that are detonated and destroyed in one hut at a time. Acting goes horribly. What happened to Robert Walker Jr.? At some point it was in some major studio productions, then faded. This movie really explodes, but if you have not seen Biker for a long time, it's good to see it. At the end of the film, you should feel a little rubbish to see it!
