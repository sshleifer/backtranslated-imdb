I discovered that this film gets the rental out of the package. The coma on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. Then the film reaches the women wearing raccoon masks. Zero special effects ... Even scenes of fighting you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. The interesting thing about it is that Lommel behaves in the film briefly and is worse than the rest of the actors litter in the film. The only thing I can think of is that Lomil is just trying to make a movie so bad that people call it "cult classic" ... However, I can not imagine anyone who thinks this is just one of the worst films ever made. The real horror in this film is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed I hired him and I promise not to see Lummel's film again!
