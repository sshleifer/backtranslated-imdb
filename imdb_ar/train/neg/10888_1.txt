This film is very shocking. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is almost non-existent, and the characters are full of stereotypes and specials - FX make you just laugh. The only notable thing in this film is the guest appearance of Rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie is supposed to be a comedy I will not get this point. If you want to watch this movie: Please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs ... especially when the Special-FX first appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like the trash that was created cheaply: this movie has to be seen for you.
