No one except those who love silent films is likely to appreciate any of the results of the camera's lyrical work and the busy (but deceptive) backtracking that accompanied the 1933 version. Although the sound became public in 1928, there are no more than 50 words Pronounced The story of a woman, unhappy married, her husband marries a younger man after a romantic period in the forest. <br /> <br /> The most obvious scene is that the jealous husband gives the elevator to the young man to ride in the city, and continues to drive naturally until he realizes that the man is his wife's lover. In a state of jealousy, he drives at the highest speed towards a railway crossing but changes his mind at the last minute and loses his temper. It is likely to be the most tense scene in the story, which was slow moving and clearly contradictory. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR is given some kind of close treatment that Marlene Dietrich is overwhelmed by her discoverer, but her beauty has not yet been refined by cosmetic doctors as they were when they were moved to Hollywood. Her performance mostly consists of searching for sad and vanity while mourning for the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of her smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), a handsome young nail who retrieves her clothes after bare swimming. <br /> <br /> The swimming scene is very short, filmed in a hidden way, and does not deserve all the heat it generates. The scene of making love, later, is brilliantly filmed with a kind of lyrical photography evident in most of the film - brilliantly. More imagination is left with the use of symbolism - this is something that made others declare that the film is a kind of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Not so. It is disappointing, terrible in the sound parts (including the hard music in the background) and Miss Lamar is certainly fortunate that Louis B. Meyer watched the film and, on the basis of it, gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work that I did not do. <br /> <br /> Obviously this was filmed as a silent movie with the camera doing all the work. The "workers" scene continues to be stained in the end for too long an unnecessary intrusion. Failed to finish the movie on the appropriate note.
