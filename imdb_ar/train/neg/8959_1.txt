Some people might consider this film a piece of art - to be able to express your imagination in the film to create a film full of pain and death. I personally think this film is disgusting, and it should never have been released. This film is disgusting, illogical and meaningless. Not only is this a waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The horrific images that appear in the film not only make you understand the air, but also keep in mind and take days to forget. It is such a shame that people lose their imagination for such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example at least, but "Kill Bell" has its purpose, meaning, height and resolve.
