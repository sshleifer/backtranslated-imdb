It starts from a nice note just to stumble quickly and disappoint. <br /> <br /> Mac characters (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly designed until a Mac president decides to connect it to three flight attendants. The rest of the drama revolves around how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem to be forced. <br /> <br /> Around the actors, Parish Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was wasted in the role of mood cooker. Akshay Kumar is acceptable, and John Abraham is very bad and still stumbles on the furniture, Rajbal Yadav is the only grace in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is sometimes funny, but in all DUD (dull songs) and great specialization if you are hoping to get some entertainment and comedy useful.
