Less self-conscious and less exciting than the GUTS OF A BEAUTY, flick about Kazuo Komizu deserves a look (at least once). <br /> <br /> The nice shots are taken with actresses who want to be in a remote house in the woods for sexual harassment. Unfortunately (for peer children), the long-lived Devil, who lives in the forest, has targeted girls for pleasure. <br /> <br /> It ends up entertaining with the boys - this is if you think about cutting heads, cutting and masturbating with "fun" edges. <br /> <br /> Again, everything looks better on paper than the shape and sounds in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just like Komizu, the victim of the dead life in the Tokyo Bay, is unstable, and he spoils this effort and only saves him with some bold violence and some big white shots. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this hype, or, do not buy the hype. I would be very disappointed.
