This movie is very annoying. It seems that the main character is 35 years old, and I have seen a large number of rock balls containing more balls than this man. The movements of conspiracies are so predictable that they are not worth seeing for the humorist. <br /> <br /> And also some of the worst conversations I've heard in 3 years, "Let's go find a little animal to torture." Ugh ..... I can not even follow up, do not watch this garbage pile, I've been manufacturing in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The highlight of what lies drunk is an exorbitant personal description of a gay master to draw pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, inaccessible
