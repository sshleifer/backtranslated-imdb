Bernard Rapp died last year and was a highly educated journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest feelings (he developed a world-wide film dictionary) and was therefore willing to use a camera at least once in his life. (1996) Although Terrence Stamp's stunning performance was filmed in character photography, "une Affaire De Gott" (2000) was an affair even if Bernard gave Giraudeau a performance Bad, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another loser and "Un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" was as disappointing as his predecessors. Their comedic potential is being exploited in a flimsy way. <br /> <br /> However, the idea of ​​the beginning allows you to predict a spiritual comedy. A couple held by Evan Attal and Sandrine Kieberlin who have invited their friends, move completely in a charming palace. To play with their guests, they pretend to conspire with each other. Things are not going as planned because the announcement of separation does not surprise them. Lovers begin to think about the health of the couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush landscapes and promising materials at his disposal, Rapp's uncommon guidance can not manage the life of this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a famous pattern with characters with known specific functions and masks that are exposed to who they really are. The verbal or comic effects often fall off. Poor editing leads to a slight fade of the film with the bad habit of Rapp to abruptly cut off many sequences. Even the honest input of the actors in the project is debatable. They seem bored and read their texts instead of living there, especially Sandrine Keplerin. The audience will soon discover a deep race. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Bernard Rapp's films did not live up to his intentions, with "Un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence" being screened.
