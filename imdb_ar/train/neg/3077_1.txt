Hobgoblins ... What a concept. Rick Sloan was Seda in this film. He had the wit to produce a film with actors who could not act. Moreover, he chose to write a script based on a kind of bad acid trip that was seriously wrong. Put it together, end up with a movie that sucks more than a warehouse full of suction cups and detergents for vaccines. This film was very painful. The pain caused is equal to the pain caused by genital pits with a spoon, then the wound is covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
