I have watched this movie several times and never thought it was funny, but it's still fun and I watch it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about the women who work in a company and their head jerk and end up giving it their own taste, and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the eighty stars that plays the role of a good bad guy, not really evil, unpopular. Dolly Bartin is a lovable and fun to watch comedy movies and really illuminates to the south. Jane Fonda is very good and does not do much for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this film, she has the most lines and made me laugh loud several times, she has love. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this to anyone who likes the 1980s comedy. I like the movie but it contains things I do not like. It starts off nicely and has a good flow and then everything starts to gather at one time and makes me less interested in the characters. They have all the little delusions about what they would like to do although the work is "nice" but I thought it was slower than the movie flow. As the film progresses up again the extremes of things happen and then slow down again, just to conclude in a quick way and this is very good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you do not see it. I think that depending on the mood, it might be a bit popular.
