The story is trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the film is very good .. even take it out. The main problem is the castings, which have turned this film into almost local and regular clich√©s with a significant lack of impact and a lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Raphael (played by Assi Dayan), all the other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the blind big girl, played by Tali Sharon, was new but without any leading role. So the figure you acted on is light and low. There were moments and rings that looked more than a rehearsal then a real film. But after all, it's good to start over and make big improvements in the future.
