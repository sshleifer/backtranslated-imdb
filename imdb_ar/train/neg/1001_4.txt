I have rented this DVD and feel upset because Dawson and Lugasi are very serious in DVD comments. It is not a very bad film, but it is one of those films that desperately want to be a deep commentary on human nature while not realizing that his story is a practical thing. In addition, a bit simplistic about the issue in many ways, the behavior of characters often strained to believe. I would say it's a movie you'll get if you do not have a lot of movies / television / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost the same story in horror movies). Otherwise, his point of view has been clarified by the more subtle. This is about the big problem, which is that he really does not have much cinematic interest to this point. It ends up being a fairly pleasant film that generally invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and does not really bear fruit.
