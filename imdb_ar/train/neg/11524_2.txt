A largely incoherent film about a man from a religious sect of the Hippy who left the country in the 1960s and fought it sixteen years later. The man had a child with one of the other cultures, who was hidden during a raid by the police, and was taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin beside the river. Worship kills some of its followers or some people in the city. It is difficult to trace the identity of the characters or the time period in which the scenes are supposed to occur. The conditional release of the leader after 16 years (obtained from the fund - I missed the amount of time in the film). There is no one who looks older, not significantly, anyway. <br /> <br /> One homicide is performed using a large circular saw saw, others with knives or a bow. I never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the film, but he is the person who overcharges, hunts and hunts. <br /> <br /> The movie gets together very badly, with voice support (not much) to explain what's going on. Some sound effects were very bad. He punches the man and hears the sound of a whip. A woman launches a gun, we do not hear her shoot, but we hear a hustle instead! It does not seem to have been done for comic effect.
