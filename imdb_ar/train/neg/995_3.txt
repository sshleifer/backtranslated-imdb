Rosario Dawson plays the role of the raped girl and then begins in the dark until she has a chance to retaliate. While Dawson's role is clear, it is an opportunity to show her acting parts and make a small Hollywood independent film. It is also clear that, apart from the stunning good looks, Dawson is misplaced. He simply forgave me. That's not a mistake, that's what I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know it is on the screen, but although I spent the better part of two hours looking at it, it did not leave any impression on me at all. I blame the script for that because unlike the end, there are not many things that have happened on the screen that seem logical. People seem to be more in a position than they are real and what seems to be incompatible. I do not want to talk about it but I can not cause it to spoil it, and the image of Rosario Dawson as something more than a picture, I stayed with me, what can I say, this might click with you, maybe not, For me it's time I can not go back. For Rosario Dawson fans only, although you are warned there are several real reasons to make this NC17. (And Rosario - please, you are a better actress, choose better texts)
