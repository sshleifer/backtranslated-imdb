I grew up watching the Inspector Tool. It has been and remains one of my favorite cartoons, if not my favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from a field trip to the "Smart Gadget Inspector". I wanted to slide on banana peel and become the greatest investigator ever. <br /> <br /> But the film has spoiled the reputation of great animation. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, certainly did not have the role of Inspector Tool. The first thing - in the movie, a clever inspector tool. Not so in animation. In the movie, the Puzzle Gadget resolves on its own. In the cartoons, Benny and Brin's book has always been a wonderful book (I still want her book!). If the tool had solved the puzzle, it was by chance. The mini-gadget in the film seemed to be a specialized investigator, but in the animation it was very stupid, as it was the source of humor. <br /> <br /> Another thing is "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It is not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. Also, gadget gadget should never be a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> Also, I miss the real tools that Gadget had, especially the Gadget. In the film the convertible was elegant. In the carton, the car was a sedan and could turn into a car. They hardly contained any instruments and were mainly present to bring him from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the only thing that was terrible in the film was that it was a feature film. The animated gadget inspector was a silly Saturday morning. The film was very serious, too exaggerated, and had a lot of plot and was not funny remotely. <br /> <br /> Advice for those who have not seen him: I have never seen him. Start. Watch animation, it's a real classic game.
