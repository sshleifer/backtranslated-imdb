A film trying to be smarter than its makers can produce. The film wraps up and moves through the Mirad plot "Surprises" in a desperate attempt to keep the public guessing, publicly breaking into the "conspiracy" with steamy scenes they thought would help. <br /> <br /> James Blushi participates in this pseudo-intellectual endeavor and just sleeps through the movie. The same applies to other "actors". The plot is very silly and tacky. If they were not in themselves such a crime, but in the end, the movements of the vast plots became very boring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film succeeds in generating some interest in the middle. Its all worth watching lazy on a really boring day, but do not worry if you miss this one. <br /> <br /> Somewhat lame 4!
