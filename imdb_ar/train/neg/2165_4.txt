This film was a rather strange viewing experience. It is clear that the film depends on the play. Now I'm sure that everything in this movie works perfectly well in a play but in the film, it does not seem to be interesting enough to watch. The film is "wonderful" to a large extent and did not bother him changing some dialog boxes to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead, what is now being presented is a nearly literal reproduction of a theatrical theater, with higher personalities and structured dialogue. Because of all this, the storyteller does not actually work and the film becomes a complete and obsolete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes some time before you discover that this is a comedy you are watching. At first you think it's a drama you see, with strange characters in it but as the movie progresses, you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicistic comedy, and tends more towards this type of comedy, not drama type. Characters and dialogue are really the things that make this film strange and the highest level sometimes becomes inaccessible. Sure, the actors are great. Peter O'Toole and Susanna Yorke, among others, but they do not really rekindle the film to a "sufficiently full" level. <br /> <br /> The story is completely confused. The story is basically not about anything and focuses mainly on the characters of the brother / sister played by Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York. But what exactly is the story? The film looks like an outdated futile film that has little to offer. As I said earlier; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as a film, it really is not appropriate and simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Editing is simply horrific and times and becomes so funny in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> It was expected to see more director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously made far better films than this failed play, which has been translated into plays. Worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
