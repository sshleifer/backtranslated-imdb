This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION group does not need to be included because it is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. But what you do is shine when you're on the screen. The film near the plot is just an excuse to present some of the players contracted with Warner today. JANCIE RULE shows promise and it is shameful that she did not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if this is in color. Travis Airforce base locations with some rear projection work well. The best of the film is some great musical breaks. If you're thankful for your lucky stars and Hollywood CANTEEN, you'll love this star.
