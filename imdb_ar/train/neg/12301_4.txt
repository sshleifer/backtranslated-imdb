My bad clothes and worse and worse music: David Hasselhoff. The 1980s returned with a retaliation from Witchery, a joint American-Italian production, led by Joe 'D' Amato, a notorious producer and short-term director (thank heaven for the little miracles) directed by Fabrizio Llorente. Witchery has been marketed as a series of Sam Raimi Evil Dead series in Italy (called "La Casa" there), where Witchery offers some modest grocery stores and their bad behavior. <br /> <br /> A combination of ghost story, property and magic, the film reverberates from scene to scene without leaving some serious wooden actors and the slow and slow night mix progressing slowly to the expected ends, with some serious WPT peak. (I just love the look on her face ...) Surprisingly Laurenti managed to gather some suspense and air from the slag in a few scenes - very few; unfortunately for him, these few glimpses of moderate movie charm go down quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> Facing additional aspects, when the bull hits the fan. This section is very active and enjoyable in that classic latex and red paint style in the 1980s, when things were made 100% hand-crafted, amazingly and with the liveliness of modest budgets. I can only watch with Sadie joy and a few teachers all the ways in which abhorrent characters (and actors) are misled and misused, one by one. I felt sorry only Linda Blair, who was apparently not allowed to experience any role other than the old / old woman in her career, or so it seems when reviewing his film. <br /> <br /> Well, people - nothing more to tell him, even less to talk about home. Do not expect much when you spend some rainy days with this, and you may enjoy at least some moderate fun. It also helps if your small, corrupt heart beats over the 1980s. Speaking of the hearts - every film David Hasselhoff is subjected to interference by a large metal object and heavy bleeding throughout the room and corridors, must be one in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is my truth? its yours?
