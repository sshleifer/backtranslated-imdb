I've found Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews believing I can handle an average movie. However, this film was slightly below average, but so far. The script was poorly written and the average representation of a B-level film was with a couple appearing in good condition. The plot lies on Saw's borders, people learn what they did in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more, but that's where the comparison ends. Nine dead trying to have a heart and a goal behind simple ideas is not new. The main mistake I found in the killing of nine people was a slap in the face of scenes from the past that occurred 3 minutes ago in the film and was not necessary at all, and the ending was quite inadequate that people would not see it coming, in a bad way. Except for any spoilers I saw the worst bad movies, so they did not end this badly. Decent flick, misrepresentation and ending though ...
