Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there, both thinking, it should get better, these actresses are so good they do not waste their time in this nonsense. The unattractive characters, the penetrating texts and the quick steps make for two long hours. In fact I could not penetrate them and left to shop for groceries (cat litter more attractive than this film). The husband stayed and confirmed that he had not improved - by the time the friends were killed, I wished they would all collide with the car and end their miserable lives. It will be more fun without limits. Beautiful scenery and fashion can not keep this one alive.
