I saw this on the market at Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's real mania - there's nothing wrong with that but you have to compensate for that with little sex or nonsense or both. <br /> <br /> Larry Cohen thought. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actress - well done to the producers because of her fastening. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the space ship coming down is hilarious - you can photograph all the hands of the crew vibrating around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish the people who made this good - at least not a buzz.
