I remember reading all the terrible and horrible reviews of this film when it was released. I was going to see how terrible it was but it was outside the theaters in three weeks. The only other film that manages this is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie appeared on a DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it was. I could not think of the tremendous interest that this film was getting. After seeing him, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that this film is not without some great shots. There is a wonderful shot at first showing a bullet fired from inside the gun, which I thought was fantastic. The way the monsters die in this film seems cool to look at; but it becomes old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me begin with the worst thing about this movie: Tara Reed. If the bad behavior is a sin, then Hell has gotten rid of Tara Reid since it was unbelievably awful in this film, and this is unimaginable. In all roles, you play a faithful role. Now if you play an empty stupid sex toy, then I may be able to forgive her in the way she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize that, although he seemed to think that if she took off her shirt in the film, people would see it. Did not realize that making them do it in the middle of the movie at the absolute wrong moment made the film even more bad. Is this a Mexican song or something during the drying scene of camels? I could not say <br /> <br /> which leads me to my following complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst exit skills you might see in the film. I mean, I'll give House of the Dead an F (and I only do so for a very few movies) but HotD would score at least B for the unwanted piece of paper. The film begins with a very long narrative that causes instant distortion (and is read by an awful narrator). From there, the tracks are really stupid. There is one point where Slater and Reid look around a destroyed building and blackout the screen. When he returns, Slater and Reid shoot all over the place and suddenly, an entire army joins them. Hey? <br /> <br /> No one bothered to check the errors in this film. At some point, the team penetrates glass, but the glass breaks before touching it. Tara Reid earrings change colors in the middle of one scene and after you walk Slater away from the dead comrade, you can see that they start to advance. <br /> <br /> For the story ... I really lost. Something about an ancient tribe that unleashes darkness and "opens the way" or anyone and all evil monsters come out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of weapon sights (the technology is so sophisticated here that you do not need any character to re-upload it in this movie) which simply gets BORING. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie in the hope that I would laugh unbelievably stupid. I did not laugh, but I still think he is stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
