This is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted! The plot is, sorry ERR, did you say there was a conspiracy? It was the most horrifying moment when ..., both do not think of one! The best special effect made me hide under the bed sheets was ..., both do not think of one for it. You know who was the killer right from the start. There was nothing scary about the entire film. In fact, the two mysteries were when I saw the little sister, Misty, in the bathroom, and when I saw nurse Tuban take her head. You should watch this movie just to get an idea of ​​how not to produce a horror film !!!
