I am a Catholic taught in narrow primary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and colleges. I am still a practicing Catholic, but I will not consider it a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the Church because I do not believe certain things or act in certain ways just because the Church asks me to do so. <br /> <br /> So I went back to the movie ... It's bad because two people were killed by this nun who is supposed to be satire as the embodiment of a religious figure. There is no comedy in this film, and the irony has not been well done by Diane Keaton's acting. I have never seen the play, but if it's quite different from these films, it might be good. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the gun might be a fake, and the first time you fired all through a plan for the four former female students as an attempt to show the emotional and intellectual intolerance of the faith of Sister Mary. But it turned out that the bullets were real and the story was a tragedy ... the tragedy of losing life (along with the two previous students ... the life of the oppressed children, the mother of the student), the dogmatic tragedy of power over the love of people and the tragedy of organized religion replacing the true faith in God. This is a mistake in Islam today and in Judaism and Christianity.
