I went to see this movie at the college theater thirty years ago because I loved Bruce Dern in the Silent Run and Family Plot to this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), still the most wonderful film ever. It just lasted without any noticeable point, and then it ended. The lights appeared and I saw everyone looking around and they were confused. Have you missed the reel projection? I did not want to know. All I remember about the film is that it was not a drama about some of the annoying basketball players and their coach. The most entertaining part of the film was watching the audience's puzzling words. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
