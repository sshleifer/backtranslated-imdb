Slow, slow, slow ... There is no ambiguity or excitement in this film. If you do not know who is the "mole" in the first ten minutes, you must be dead in the brain. The secret service must also be the other, because it took them the entire film to put it together. There are no convincing characters in the film (no film). The pace of the film is slow there is no tension. Killer Tenant is an excellent shot unless he targets Michael Douglas more than all he seems to be able to hit is large glass panels. The most extreme scene in the film is when the wife of the president says the code word in the end against the effect. He laughs loud fucking. At least six people got up and left early. I had joined them if I did not sit in the middle of the row. I do not recommend this film to anyone.
