This film gets a rating of 6/10 from me, as well as 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror horror horror film, where motion, calmness and fear are taken into consideration, this movie will move to you. It's basically a family drama like what you see on the Lifetime Channel, but put into a world of horror. The story and equation are old, renovated hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the Earth's structure or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take the zombie and you will get something melodramatic like a beautiful mind, based on cheese. This is version 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic summary and idea are very original and top. It is literally something that interests you and your friends when you are drunk. . . But that joke actually got a theatrical show. The idea gets 9/10 of me. The only reason for their incompleteness is that they could have taken it further, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The combination of both has been mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most comics, it was not so funny. I had my mom and her little sister watching it with me and the jokes we made were more fun than written jokes. There were moments of absolute genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films will take this kind of risk and original ideas. I can not say that it was perfect, or even near, because of the lack of originality in the plot. <br /> <br /> A wonderful family movie. A wonderful movie to watch with a group of players (or girls). Fantastic movie to watch with anyone. . . But if you're watching it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this kind of movies richer and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
