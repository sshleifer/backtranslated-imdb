It is unfortunate that you can not go to less than one star. Before watching The Wicker Man, you had considered the 3 aliens as the only movie that actually deserved the negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not detract from enjoying a previous film, but the fact remains that my cumulative enjoyment of the film has been reduced by watching it. <br /> <br /> A cheap trick is also often used in Hollywood when producers are too hungry to set a good book or in a hurry so they are not allowed to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: a slap at the end of a tragic and I hope the public will make mistakes It's because of something artistic or meaningful. It is a maneuver that rarely succeeds, in which case it can only embarrass the good actor and irony of the producers. More importantly, the "carefully designed" conclusion (or whatever its situation) does not seem to logically follow the plot (which I naturally can not expand without introducing the spoilers), and instead denies what it deserves. So this point. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that may appeal to psychopaths, child molesters, and perhaps Nicholas Cage's fans, but to a few mainstream audiences. If you really like something like this, I would rather recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead. Lacking the kind of erase memory tablets, I suppose I need to watch something better to force it out of my mind, for example, an attack from a tomato killer or Bigwig adventure?
