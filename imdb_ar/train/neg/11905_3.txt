With his penchant for repeating himself, Winders has been a constant disappointment since he achieved great success with Paris Texas. <br /> <br /> "Land of plenty" is no exception. Considering that I was expecting a medium-level film even before I entered, Winders' ambitions seemed to be improving. He was filmed because he is now grubby, his movies are rude and explosive. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that was making fun of Central America or some exciting movies. The results of Dahl's personality are fully predictable. Winder's insistence on putting many scenes with some very annoying rock songs. He covered the holes in his plan and guided him by pressing the viewer. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that many people will find this movie important and resonant, but honestly, this malicious and educational effort speaks only of misdirection. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Winders announced that while making "Paris Texas", he got great help from Sam Shepard in the script. Yes, that was the best thing about Wanders, and now he has to understand that he needs a good screenwriter. His films have been from the last 15 years + total mess.
