I am a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma but I could not believe he made this film. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Kag did not come near the real Cholay. Does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma failed to create chemistry between characters. There is no intimate relationship between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Muhannal off off is striking. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this film. Ajay and Sushmita were trying to do their best but to no avail. Adjust the voice of Rajpal Yadav - ineffective and useless. Muhanalal has done full justice and proved once again that acting is all about facial expressions and body language. The rest was cast below expectations. The comics that were adapted from the original film were put into flat flat in this film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but because of the differences surrounding the film, he was messed up, and only for the sake of making this Agh. But there is no fire.
