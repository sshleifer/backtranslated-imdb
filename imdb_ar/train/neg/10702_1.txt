Dialogue: Quilted, Clichehead; Representation: Hammer, Cliché; Land: Predictable, Cliché. <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer do with Nastasiya Kinski in this garbage? Plummer was firmly established decades before the production of this film, and Kinski was carrying masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" behind them ... They must be desperate. <br /> <br /> All bad guys have bad badges - Bad * Bad man accents! (In particular! Where * * * learn to learn "German"?) And most of them are cynics as well. Innocent passers-by have gone through their panic enough to make you laugh. The good guy survived, among other things: * 5 "Throw a knife buried deep in his shoulder - just pull it out and seconds later the arm is used without any difficulty at all; * Firearms of the Marine Corps (I think someone pointed to .50) in the leg • Fall, backward, from what looks like the third floor, to the pavement, and to the wall, Without the slightest sign of twisted ankle or any inconvenience such tampering The text contains three smart lines, the rest at the time In which all this is boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Well, it was not all bad, Plummer offers a certain category on his part, and he is undoubtedly the best actor in that click, of course he does not say that much, but he can do evil The cruelty without resorting to the pork techniques used by most of the villains here in his "Ve haff vays and mean" line, line up with some dangers, but you always realize you're watching Christopher Plummer acting wicked. <br /> <br /> This movie is really wasteful The acting, as it is, is a kind of 70s of the type 007, the wooden delivery line meets the scenes of the very fake Bruce Lee battle, but it is not as good anywhere as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee. Do not care.
