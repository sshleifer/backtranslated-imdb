A very boring, clear, boring exorcist featuring Doberman with red eyes - this is the range of special effects in this cheap made TV. Richard Krina is as vital as a chewing game. Dress and Music Very 70 add only to torture. It should make you sleep at the same speed as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Virtually useless. MooCow says eaghhh what a stinking dog! : = 8P
