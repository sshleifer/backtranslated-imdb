During the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position get the roles of existing movies only to take advantage of it. I have no idea what Thomas paid for this film, but I have to get a lot of money to agree to a national self-deception in my own film. It is clear that the film is derived from the movie "Enter the Dragon", as well as most martial arts pictures. Instead of the real martial arts, they fabricated a new martial arts ridiculous, one critic accurately described as "the intersection of Kung Fu and break dance." A gymnast (Thomas, of course) was hired to save some lady from an impenetrable castle, but each room has a pillar and that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the bad guys helpers. Of course, he fights his way to the leading villain, and of course they have a fictional battle, with its end that will surprise only those who have never seen a film of organizational art. There are touches that will be loved by nostalgia types, especially the mulberry haircut for Thomas and many male male participants. But the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he did not set the film set.
