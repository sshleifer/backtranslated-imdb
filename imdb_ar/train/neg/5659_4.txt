The disappointing end of the season started well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus part 2 and other highlights were among the best seen on TV in any series, so this was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if this episode was disappointing, but the cheese guitar music in it accompanying the closing sequence was funny and will be more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It looks as if corporate executives did not like the end of the main low note and wanted to turn it on. They failed and spoiled everything rather. <br /> <br /> Let's hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> At least, we saw the return of a certain person even if it was rather strange and really done.
