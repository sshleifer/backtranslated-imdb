The "secret" part was meant to rethink the popular appeal of the scandalous magazine of the same name, while the subject of spying on workers was linked to the major congressional investigations of that day. However, despite the representation of A-grade B and some good text ideas, the film takes you for 73 minutes. It's cheap jack production all the way. What is required to offset the weak production values ​​is some imagination, especially from unscrupulous director Sydney Salco. For example, some of the site's snapshots in daylight would help ease the melancholy studio sequence. The elegant Aquarius man like Anthony Mann may have done something with thick ear, but Salko treats it as just another paid exercise. It is very unfortunate that the low-profile Brian Keith style does not work here, showing it only as wooden and idle, while at the same time the figure of worship Elisea Cook Junior stands out at the top drunk. Clearly, Salkow is not a representative director. But you have to hand it over to this bizarre little number Beverly Garland, who treats her with great enthusiasm and dedication. Too bad, you are not responsible. My advice - skip it, unless you are in sexy girls who do nothing but the traditional style 50-style whiskey.
