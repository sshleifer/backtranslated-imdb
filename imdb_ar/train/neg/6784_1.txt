I've tried to watch this movie twice, and even then I was redirected to the irritating parts but I could not get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this film got * honestly * any good ratings. I think those people who make such good reviews are just trying to drive the film for marketing purposes. Their review seems very unreal and looks like a job at home, making things even more pitiable. Movies must get real positive comments on their steamy and not fabricated comments !! <br /> <br /> The acting reminded us of a cheesy pornographic film, not in a funny way. Do not mind low budget movies with bad behavior if they know how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I found the main character to be angry. His facial expressions and humor were unbearably childish. I thought this was meant to make the woman's plot look more fun and foundation, but it was worse. <br /> <br /> The script was very critical (its bosses had bypassed the business letter) and the sarcastic comments were strange. <br /> <br /> I found nothing to take advantage of this film, unlike some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that the evaluation was misleading. I was interested in her hypothesis but I was afraid of everything else. Of course, see if you want to, but I just do not want anyone else to raise his hopes / waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... maybe not.
