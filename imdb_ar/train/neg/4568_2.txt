Not quite a bad start to the program - but what a slap in the face of real law enforcement. The worst part of this series is that they try to describe themselves as real fare - and nothing but. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better. What is next, College of Medicine in one minute? Sharo Libo performance? Charles Grodin Help On Hip Replacement? Come on ... show a little respect. Even the citizens of Munci finish the program as planned. Police Academy = High School Gym? (How many times can they use a shot from one car to another from Taco Bell in the background?), The effects of the cheese sirens (the same episode added a nightmare to each "call", whether or not a symbol), and last but not the least - more problems For the safety of officers more than you can get rid of. <br /> <br /> If I want to see the work of fake police and fake police officers, I will see the RENO 911.
