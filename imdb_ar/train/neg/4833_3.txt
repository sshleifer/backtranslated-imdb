Yes, this film is a true thief. Some brilliant Academy Awards have been stolen from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero to boost acceptance of the wars the United States is still fighting to date. I do not really want to go to politics, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. Hurt's closet is really nothing wonderful, and there is no real conspiracy at all. I really feel that I was in the fifties of Hungary when the party told people what they liked and did not like. The same propaganda films were produced at the time, except those that were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable part of the kind of "great US wars", it is certain that you have much better films to choose from.
