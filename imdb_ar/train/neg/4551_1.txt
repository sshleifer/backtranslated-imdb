I must admit that I do not own much of the new jumbo. When people exchange energy, I always wonder how kJ is actually involved and how it can contribute to solving the problem of global warming. When "energy" is imposed, I always wonder how they have managed to violate the laws of the universe and are still without Nobel Prizes. When people feel instinctive to enable them to move unimpeded through the intricacies of life, I wonder how they failed to do something as simple as finding a train station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first film with the holes of the plot and most of them I find quite acceptable and entertaining. If this is the case with "The Celestine Prophecy", this film will not be burned, but unfortunately it did not happen. Every actor seems to be bored with his head and unable to understand what he is supposed to do at the site. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I would like to do when talking about quantum physics with someone who actually knows what he is talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> The trend is not inspiring as well. You might expect something more than the guy who "had dreams come", but hey, I assumed he got a good pay for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, my friend .." The only person who seems to enjoy He is a bad person all the time JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this film who may have a few clever cracks in this eternal speech and wonderfully completed the new age. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar to one of these dinner dates when you discover that your date is in fact terribly bear and seems unable to remain silent. In one moment of time, words seem to turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown on your head nonstop until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and you have to choose between this movie and stick to the safety pins in your eyelids, take advice: choose the latter.
