My score for this nonsense: 1/10 1 for technology only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another meaningless film. Clearly, creating a good screenplay for a film or television is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, but it's hard to understand how to make films pathetic. <br /> <br /> We must believe that people are taken for the sake of folly. Maybe it was reason to believe, because 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid, silly and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at our price for the Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make films more absurd than others. <br /> <br /> It is strange that he has always been a money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this **, press the Fast Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
