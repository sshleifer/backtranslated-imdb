Frank Taslin's "The Front Front" is one of the shortest private life films, a series of cartoons created as Army education films. Instead of taking some undesirable actions that lead to disaster, the "Front Front" instead focuses on its loved ones at home and how much they can provide for the war effort as well. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It is a concept with little potential for good pens. Instead, Tachlin plays the role of the rising card, and the extended jokes of strippers and girls dressed in comic clothes instead of effective comic satisfaction. The result is short-lived goodwill, which is of little importance or value for today's entertainment other than that it is a historical artifact.
