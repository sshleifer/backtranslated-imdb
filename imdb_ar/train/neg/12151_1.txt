Maybe this is the worst representation I've ever seen in a movie ... at all. And what's up with casting. The leading lady in this film has a kind of deformity in the nose and it is almost impossible to look at any period of time without focusing on her nose. You can go to the local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 of the most qualified and best-looking ladies. I made a regrettable mistake to rent this movie because it had a "cool" DVD issue. This film seems to be just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technology college. You'd better spend an hour or so that this movie was watching public television ... at least the best special effects and the people there are more attractive than anyone else you will see in this movie
