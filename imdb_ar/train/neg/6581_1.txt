I hired "New Best Friend" in the hope of a similar movie to excite teenagers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, the "best new friend" is very much like "The In Crowd", where there is no suspense and incredibly false representation. "Best New Friend" boring, the events during the film are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
