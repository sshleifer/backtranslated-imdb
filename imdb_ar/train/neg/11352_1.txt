This is what you will get if you allow a 10-year-old American man to write a story of a lunar journey. The absolute garbage with no replacement properties probably retained some magic in a three-dimensional section. But as an entertaining and entertaining cartoon, there was nothing to waste an hour and a half worth the time. Save your time and owner and see BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn. There are not enough lines, yet I feel that it sums up ... Well, I agree with the review above - this is like the cold war propaganda story. Maybe it would be more interesting if they made it around the flies detecting the moon landing trick, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - Why were all the main personal flies distorted? - No one has a complete compliment from the parties!
