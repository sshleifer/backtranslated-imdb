A former reviewer said the film was not too bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies children's harassment. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was nude at it, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. Why not complete 10? Because cinematography was "painful", the child's shock was "unrealistic" and the bright friend was "annoying." The references nowhere in the review show no irritation that an American film in 1981 showed scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman. I came across this vulgar film in a movie during a Showtime stay. For me, even if the chubby friend had survived a storm and deserved Oscar, I still had to give the film only one star. Howard Hessman took the lead in the film at the same time as WKRP, which is particularly ironic. But do not take my words for it!
