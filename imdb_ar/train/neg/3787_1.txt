I must be the only man in America who did not like this film. I think this was not my style or anything, and I do not see what is so wonderful about it, it was hardly amusing, let alone one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> It concerns a person who came from nothing and goes on to become the drug lord. A very simple way to describe an entire movie, this is exactly my feeling about the entire film. Contrary to what many people think, just because the film revolves around the mafia / drug trade / criminal groups does not make it a great movie automatically, do not forget to tell good stories.
