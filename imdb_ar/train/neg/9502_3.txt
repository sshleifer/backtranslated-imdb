This film was strange and completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch it with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really liked the opening things with Lisa wandering lost in a wonderful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European languages, but I may not be in a low-budget panic. Definitely get to the end where there are exotic sex scenes that have been cut (in DVD version anyway). Do not try to understand it, just follow and beware of exotic bits ... that's all. You do not see this if you really want to be a plot or characterization or anything at all logical. Very beautiful, although you may give up this and decide to watch a real horror film, for example, Dead Alive.
