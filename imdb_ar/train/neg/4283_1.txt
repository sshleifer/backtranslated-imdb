Sorry but that's true. "Legiunea sträinä" clearly reveals the failure of Daneliuc irreversible. <br /> <br /> As already said, the author has lost the faculty to unify its content and technical aspects in a coherent form. An obsession with the mechanical trick of randomly selecting and joining random news topics is of no interest; it only collects a heap of uncontrolled events, unable to follow the lower story line. Theatrical text level is like a play amateur "Cântarea României" about the exploits glorious realism of socialism - only, turn upside down: while the Communist line dictates the narrow interest only positive and festive sugary, has become Daneliuc now obsessed with maliciously only negative and aware of disgust. The content of ideas is zero, and "message", childish and educational, at the kindergarten level. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional principles. Is no longer able to organize a dramatic position, arrange it in a correct cinematic scene, or adjust it properly, and adjust it according to the simplest rules of cinematography. The level of storytelling in films is similar to that of "a holy paper man is not right, and all people are donkeys!" What a great distance from the impressive artist in 1976-1984, who created unique works such as "Cursa" and "Proba de microfon" and "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit gloria Mundi ...
