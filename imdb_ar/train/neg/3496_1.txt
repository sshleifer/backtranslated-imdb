I remember my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They also did not understand rock and roll and many more. Now that I am nearing their age, I still remember, and I find that I understand many of the things my children love. But this is pathetic. I can not say I have seen any of Sarah except for some appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her anything special. But this show is much less than I expected from them. Making an IMDb script command looks like a potential. So, just so, I started watching the first episode. You turn it off halfway. Nothing else is better than that. Jokes aimed at 5 years presented on the supposed adult program. Well Sarah, this adult has been moved to stop you. I can not believe that someone actually funded this insult to comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are a lot of bad jokes deposited here, which provides other programs of such embarrassment.
