It is interesting to know what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing original in the film, and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were a little shallow and did not disturb either. <br /> <br /> Instead (quite nice sometimes) the bad picture is left a bit to be desirable but I think you can not expect many people who are just making a low budget movie to check it out. It is unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films. Unfortunately, this is what one has to do. On its own, it's not very good. Compared to others, they are still not very good. But it is not without good points! I love the plot. It is built fairly well and is well connected at the end. Sometimes in the dark scenes really, also succeeded in building a creepy feeling. <br /> <br /> But in the end the film failed to influence. The characters do not exist very much and we do not care about any of them. Any of them may die, but it is possible to determine the final "survivor" from very early.
