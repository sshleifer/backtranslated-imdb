Completely this most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles were used to make me sick, the music was terrible and the conversation sinking (maybe not a bad thing afterwards), San Francisco footage looked like it was stolen directly from the promotional video of the board Tourism in the city. <br /> <br /> Oh, mandatory sex scene was not even half well done. Better lighting next time, please.
