Renting a horror film is good. It seems as if the writer had never seen a horror film before and did not realize that everything he wrote was cliche and penetrated and he made fun of perfection in films such as Scream and Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> Among the scary bits, there is the most BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "We're going to prom" junk. I wanted to claw my ears. Frankly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was really no need to make this movie. The leading lady was interesting and I kept thinking "she is? Really? Man obsessed with? Really?" <br /> <br /> All characters work stupidly, including the police. (There was no sleeping policeman sitting in his car and the window just waived waiting for his throat.) Serial killer swings only around killing whoever wants without a problem. Do not resist the victims (or doors). No one has any protection or less idea to answer (or flip the security lock on the hotel room door). People like mentally disabled sheep. <br /> <br /> By the beginner, if you are a fan, you will also be disappointed. All killings are kept off the screen and are - tastefully - tastefully. (So ​​Boo Hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the less interesting murders. Most of the time has already happened by the time we discover it. <br /> <br /> The only vulgar lost is the cat that always emerges in this kind of movies. "Oh Kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer - Aye!" <br /> <br /> Then finally when the time comes for deadly death - well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious option. snoring. <br /> <br /> The audience was shaking and talking back to the screen all the time. It was stupid to believe and not be scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy filmmaking. <br /> <br /> (Oh, by the way - no coronation of a king concert or queen ... no crown ... no bucket of blood.) <br /> <br /> So save your money and hire a "curry" or " Friday 13 "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(ie them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
