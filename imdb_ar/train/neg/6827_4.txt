Dumb as he does dumb, this black comedy is supposed to be interesting. Basically what Chris starts to try to keep his eye on, eventually turn into an uninspired version of the "Three Amigo", just without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be obscene, and "Play Dead" is not. In order to act as a black comedy, it can not be so enthusiastic, it is "Play Dead". What a truly "Play Dead" game is, a city filled with walnut functions. Fred Dunst is a fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's "Simple Plan," while Jake Posey has a fairly fair tradition of Jake Bossi. - Merck
