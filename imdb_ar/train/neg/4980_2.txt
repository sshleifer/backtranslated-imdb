I just read a review defending this film because of its low budget and now I deal with things. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were well-reasoned but carried out in the worst possible way. The scenes of the fighting were not even to fight but were just one shot of a representative and then a monster shot with intense interaction at all. When the monster interacted it looked like it was done at paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget, you should use models and dolls. They may not seem fanciful but at least interact, just look at the early Peter Jacksons movies. <br /> <br /> As for the acting Beowulf he made a descent but the rest of the actors either did not try or forget where they are where. <br /> <br /> The scenario seemed confusing to me. In one minute they will talk as if it were a modern day the next day you get Shakespeare's speech from the drama club. I'm not saying that everything must be "yes" and "it is" but you have to find a coherent balance so that the lines look as if they were from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed one part close to the beginning when Beowulf was quoting from the Old Testament that could have been found if he had not spent the rest of the movies talking about gods and verses. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very slightly polished feces, but in turn nothing less.
