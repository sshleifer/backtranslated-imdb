I bought this movie for $ 5 from the CD Store, and I'm sorry. I will start by saying that I am a big fan of the horror of cheese. They offer cheap, tacky and outrageous entertainment. I enjoyed this movie for the first half hour, because it was so bad, it became easy with MST3K style. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the most terrifying part of the movie. Although the wonderful acting is not expected, it was laughably bad, and frankly, presented all the entertainment you were supposed to get. This is the positive aspect of the film. Where the film really stumbles in entertainment is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie offers many ways "What does% @ $ @ #" do? Moments. There are many moments, such as a mother that fits in a strange dinner, and then has no result at all in the film. Along the dinner line, a responsible person decided that it was fun to see people who were eating delicately for five minutes without dialogue each time a meal was served. During meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene turns into pure darkness outside. Then retreats. Speaking of the dark outside, one of the most beautiful parts of the film is the climate, where it seems to be not at night unless it rains. Talking about the dark, the big problem with the film is that it's very bad and you can not see what happens in half the time, which is more frustrating than anything else. In a climatic scene, you can not even figure out what you're supposed to see too awful. <br /> <br /> When it comes to weather scenes, Unhinged has one of the worst. I have seen people say "Wow, this surprised me, that's good." I can say that this great revelation surprised me, because I did not see it coming. The reason I did not see it coming because it makes no sense at all. I will not spoil it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent twenty good minutes rewinding to different parts of the film to find anything that would validate it at all, and all we found was more things that say it was not possible. <br /> <br /> In general, this is actually a better film when you watch it with the commentaries that make fun of it. I love crap horror movies, but this was too much.
