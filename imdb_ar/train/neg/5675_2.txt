The film "Seed" revolves around the convicted armed murderer Max Side (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in six years. He was sentenced to death, but he does not die on the electric chair, even after being traumatized three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Barry) and other officers hide this secret by burying a master alive. The Seed erupts and follows the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> "Seed" was filmed by the world's worst director (Uwe Boll), just a short film about trying to extend the envelope of a decent society and failing to deliver on any aspect of a story. He said that depends on real events because if the person survived the electric chair after being hit three times, he will be released. This is an urban myth, and it will never happen. Much like the other Boll abomination ("single in the dark" for one), "Seed" is absolutely awesome.
