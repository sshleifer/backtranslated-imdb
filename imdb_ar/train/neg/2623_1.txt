Slay Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother Frank ... well, the awards are now released! Mullit Hare, Murit Frank, thinks each part plays, invites him to play the role of a wise American / Italian refugee from The Godfather. Please, someone who gives him a proxy offer "can refuse!" This movie stinks the place out, even through the terrible exaggeration in this film, Frank still steals the betrayal of things. All people compensate for their lack of talent by screaming in their ranks and throwing their arms, and a violent look in a fashion that went out of silent movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, there, makes no sense for any meteorite to fall and turns all women into sex-crazy sex nymphs. But since this film is 15 testimonials, it just means that they wear their underwear and make their voices resemble dogs like heat . What happens in the end, I'm not quite sure that I was losing my desire to live long before the film ended. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a plague and see "Deep Impact" for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the ground. <br /> <br /> NB System point: When a female leads her clothes to her underwear, she has knickers / panties under the suspender / belt. She is a knight over the suspenders to let the women go to the toilet with less noise. There may be a trivial point, but it shows how stupid this film is when they can not even achieve it properly!
