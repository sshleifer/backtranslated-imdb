Ironically, although he is capable of "splits", Thomas is quite strong as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie was burned in my memory as one of the most cheesy and inefficient movies I have ever seen. As such, I'm really fond of it. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason this makes more than one star is that Thomas is a wonderful shape, and it is fun to see his muscular body performing a variety of gymnastics skills on rocks and scattered columns. On the rural side of Eastern Europe (including the notorious "throat horse" in the shape of a well in the middle of the village square that Thomas used to plant his feet in the faces of various crazy villagers). But let the poor man open his mouth and try to shoot, and any impression that he has a film career will end immediately. <br /> <br /> At least Thomas had the excuse that he was not really effective. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera men, etc. is at least bad, or worse, mostly professional. Even Kurt is not as fruitful as you might imagine. <br /> <br /> I hope the poor take Kurt money and run away. If anyone asks him to perform again in the martial arts film again, I will bet that Thomas is kicking the guy in the face.
