I have not seen so many low-budget films that I have to admit, but this is the worst film of all, the main character the old man talked about. He had a minute operation and lost the ability to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, 5 years of The old can behave better. The story was a very terrible plot, as well as putting the army man what I thought was an army and then skipping the summit, I just watched it to laugh over how bad it was, and I hope it leads to the real movie. I can not believe it was under the rental of two nights in movies, rather than take it for free and get it out of sight. I think there was a semi-decent representative other than the woman, and I think the only thing that fits with the budget is make-up, but they show every important scene of the film at the beginning of the music clip. Horrible simply awful.
