What were you thinking of? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays a future policeman collaborating with a modern dinosaur (!) In a crime case involving madness that wants to start another ice age. The direct surprise to the bar is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept looking for itself. This seems to have been an emotional work for his author, Jonathan Betwell (who was also a producer); unfortunately, the final results are anemia, to be charitable. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen can often raise good intentions and laugh no matter how weak the text is, but here you sink and you can see the unusual results. No stars from ****
