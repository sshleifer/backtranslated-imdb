First of all, I expected to be "Caged Heat" on the same lines as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In no way is this film used in the 1970s, "Take Off the Chains," or "Women in Prison." The plot is certainly made up of a group of women in prison, who wear street clothes (very comedy), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong competitors, no one tries to seduce the jailer or the doctor to try to escape, and there are no prisoners. There are two showers, I suspect they are just recycled footage, but no fights erupt / no one is tempted here - or anywhere for that matter! Regardless of the lack of plot, and the unmasked, unclear and flat characters, a couple of prisoners who are able to escape actually return to prison to "release" their fellow prisoners? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie must have just finished with fugitives fleeing to sunset ... instead of letting this mess continue! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
