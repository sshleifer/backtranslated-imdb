SciFi has some very bad luck in producing high quality movies recently (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grindel is supposed to be based on the great Beowulf epic, but he deviates very much (and offers very little comparison) to the extent that television ads may be entitled "Some Christopher Lambert Films." I did not expect it to be as accurate as the full blown Hollywood production, but I expected that "integrity" did not interfere with the actual story (even if it was slightly changed to make the storyboard flow for two hours well in the allotted time periods). <br /> <br /> Did the director and the producers have any idea what they were doing (did you look into this?). Obviously not, as one might say of the huge horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his crew (except the mule boy). One of the main problems I have had to look at is Greendale, if Beowulf is supposed to be wrestling with him, should not he be sixteen feet tall and weigh two tons? The slice of Grindel's death was lacking everything ?? In my opinion, the saga was actually better than the unwanted script; for example: Grindel is supposed to have his arm ripped off of the socket by Beowulf ?? Did not stop at the forearm after it was burned with the arrow explodes from the arch of fasteners seems to weigh 300 pounds! Gringel's mother? Did they combine it with the dragon at the end of the epic where he died in the end when he died of his wounds? Frankly, what the hell was with the mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie because it is related to the epic, do not do so, since there is no one (other than the characters' names). The only way I could recommend this film is if you love the movie Druids (directed by Jack Dorfman)? Although I do not recommend watching either.
