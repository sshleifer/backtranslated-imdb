The precondition for making such a film is complete ignorance of the work and character of Nietzsche, the techniques of psychoanalysis and the history of Vienna. Take a genius you did not read, describe him as dementia, and include crazy doctors to treat him, two fairly gentle women, played by an actor with a huge mustache, make every character talk to the strongest tone, and show silly dreams, Other have nothing to do with the first one (Freud), mention some words used in the works of genius, extremism all you can, especially music, you do. Attendance, please stay away.
