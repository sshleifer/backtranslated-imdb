I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself a science fiction enthusiast. I have read countless science fiction novels and enjoyed many science fiction films and television shows. I really would not think about this real science fiction. Each episode I made was like a lame version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it fun or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a group of people standing in my arms, talking about something boring, which goes through Stargate and ends up on a planet that looks exactly like Earth, with people who look like human beings! The budget looked very low. The characters are all oblivious to the one-dimensional cutouts, and many attempts at humor fall down. This reminds me when you see a commercial ad with a famous athlete, trying to be funny, but it is not. It is sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was terrible too. There is so much that you can do through a gate across space, however, every place the people at ARMY are amazed at is boring! This does not show any imagination! In fact, I thought that the TV series "Alien Nation" a few years ago (based on Alien Nation) was much better. This show was actually a good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about the "Alien Nation", but compared to this overblown nonsense, it was fantastic! <br /> <br /> Also, unlike the brilliant new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the LAME movie closely! They should have at least updated the effect of the "toilet wash" cheese when someone passes through Stargate.
