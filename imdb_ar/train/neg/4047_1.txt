***** Warning, it may contain spoilers who will be more intrusive than this trip. **** <br /> <br /> It gives you good advice to anyone living in the UK When Channel 5 has an old comedy in the late 80's, read a book instead. I am now recovering from a bout, because of reading some comments on this film here. I was really shocked by the fact that someone said that this movie is real! All I can say is that the Cold War has never escalated or we have given communes our borders ... I have found this movie extremely bitter, perhaps it is just my British perception of what makes the film funny. , Who do you know? But in all aspects, this film is not only terrible, his teeth are very terrible. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan but Bill Murray, and his flattery justifies my feelings towards him. Do not get me wrong, I loved Ghostbusterer, which was produced just three years after the film. But this sums up Bill Murray really. I can safely say that I have not wasted such a stark time since I saw the first round of the Delta Force operation here, although these two films have more common denominator than you think. For one thing, both have an awesome traffic sequence from start to finish, and second. Both are full of vulgar words, all the time. <br /> <br /> Heres one thing, these guys are supposed to be in the US Army. However, they are allowed to roam around their camp, Willy Nelly, seduce military police officers, then silencing them in the generals' ridiculous neighborhoods. Talk about random! This movie is awesome for this I'm afraid. Now do not get me wrong, I'm not sympathetic to feminism, but the fact that these two women actually fall in love with two characters shortly after their arrest and allow them to be released ... twice, just an insult to the female race. The fact that Boom Boom with thin hair (Wenger) and his unhappy friend "Rams" can simply talk about himself to the underwear of the inner mates, who are madly in love with them, is nothing short of ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then there are the training scenes, where you can identify the band "Phycho" which threatens unconvincingly to kill anyone who touches or under it, followed by the game of overweight (played by the late John Candy late) who claims to have joined the army "To avoid paying $ 400 for anger management classes." Which led to Murray's voice rising in tribute to "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent" who could not honestly organize pi $$ in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits. All that serves this scene is to pave a lot of fighting scenes, with people saying "way to go to ass hole"! All the time, and so on. <br /> <br /> Then the scenes continue to show a handful of the label that makes an absolute breast of itself in the cycle of assault, leading to a scene where one of them is shot in the air in some birds passing by an assault rifle, interspersed with a watchtower shot. (Yes, I told you that this movie was random ... it escapes with controlled precision as well ...) eventually leads to the procession of the scroll, where the unhappy team transforms magic within two hours. . (Steal me, a miracle!) Thanks to some of Murray's wise words, which they then direct to an army that is as unrivaled as a routine in front of an "elderly general" in front of the rest of the teams. All this was a great pleasure for the two friends to stand up, who should have been arrested ... Everyone laughs though. This thing is nothing short of amazing though. He then chose them to guard a new multi-million-dollar armored vehicle in Italy (which turned out to be a green mobile house with lots of tools inside), claiming, "That's exactly what this army needs!" righto ... <br /> <br /> Then there is a terrible finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this very secret model military vehicle to pick up her newly acquired and somewhat active MP friends in Germany. Captain Haples (John Laroche) then finds and leads a squad of new recruits on a mission to retrieve the vehicle. And then take a "wrong turn" on their way and end up in the Soviet Czechoslovakia, where they are captured. (As we have not seen it coming ...) So start a rescue attempt by Rams and Murray + Byrds at hand, in which a major battle is going on, shooting from the hip and bombing tanks. With them returning as national heroes, humiliating the Russians by describing them as "pussies", etc. End. That's true. No military courts, nothing. They stole only a prototype of a military vehicle, took it to a Warsaw Pact, and almost caused an international incident that could have triggered the outbreak of World War III! <br /> <br /> This movie is frankly more fun as it is diagnosed with a final illness. I know it's meant to be a comedy, you've got all the right actors for it, but where in hell? Does Channel 5 cut those pieces? The only redeeming feature of this film is the repeated use of naked women who take showers, and female Mud Wrestling. (As I said, random) is not useful to deviate from the fact that this film is quite nonsense, of course. Realistically, this film should aim at showing an immature 9-year-old film, unfortunately, we should watch it instead. 1 Star of 10 - Total Trip. My advice, do something more useful with your time. Like castrating yourself ...
