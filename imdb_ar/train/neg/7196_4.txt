The Inspector Tool (1999) ** Starring: Matthew Broderick, Robert Everett, Julie Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabni Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes PG rated <br /> <br /> by Blake French: <br /> <br /> Disney's new "Inspector Gadget" is about a cop named John Wingo from a major accident and is being saved by a state-of-the-art test that turns him into a machine-like client with tools and inhibitions of all types In his body when used when he says "Go Go", only to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual movie structure is very similar to the body composition of the Gadget Inspector itself. It is noisy, fragmented and lively and consists of a group of halfhearted heresies thrown together to make something that is not much in common with anything else that exists. The film is a series of various sequences of movement that are glued to characters and uneven stories enjoyed only by children aged 6-9 years. <br /> <br /> The heavily reinvented cop is played by Matthew Broderick, who, even the "Gadget Inspector", was on the spur of success with films like "The Election." Become an Inspector Gadget after encountering a heavy villain named "Claw". His role is played by Robert Everett, who has been exposed to the disaster this year through the movie "William Shakespeare" A Nightsummer Nights Dream appalling. "<br /> <br /> There is a romantic sub-chart in this film as well as a large number of scenes involving body parts Inspector Gadeg and elements of the mechanism.It contains gadget Gadget and Claw hanging around the attractive character Brenda, played by Julie Fisher, Both the appearance and knowledge of a specific invention by her late father, who was killed earlier by Claw The competition develops into scenes of fighting and cause of many events in the film The key features also Gadget Mobil, a life similar to cars designed for the devices Inspector Gadget He was expressed by DL Heeley from the comedy sitcom "The Hughly's." I'm not exactly a target audience for filmmakers, but even my 10-year-old relative found the film for his love, the film is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. There is no mood development beyond some of the stylish opening credits, unlike the 1997 film Mr. "Mr. Magoo ", which opened with clips from the original cartoons The question about the same kind of things in this comedy is very funny and is rarely convincing The overall design of the production is nothing but a mess of the unfinished depression of the viewer and consists of one joke: In such films, the public is known for its limitations - something to help determine what can and can not be done. In the Inspector Tool, there are no such limits. From time to party to actors who enjoyed a lot of fun, I remember another incomplete comedy released a few years ago called " Which once again contained a lot of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all the tools and propaganda tools, but lacked the necessary thing for every film: public participation. <br /> <br /> Of the characters discovered to be excluded Many are "daughter tools", which I still at the end of the film do not know what its name.It is used only as a drawing device, and I ask how it was used to promote the plot also because its presence does not bring anything relevant or productive to the film. We do not know her reactions to her father's process or accidents. Thus, this is a person who was totally excluded and would not affect the film a bit. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to mention that the Inspector Tool is a terrible and inadequate excuse. For Kids Comedy. Believe it or not, I find myself more like this film in recent violent and anti-youth years "Blade". I remember again that I have a lot of movies where nothing happens but a film where everything happens. The Inspector Application was happening a lot at the same time, it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
