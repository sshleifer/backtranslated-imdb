Since its release in 1983, the "Christmas Story", which Jean Shepard has told about the changing ego, Ralph, has become a real classic. However, "My Summer Story" occupies the position of Shepherd as a narrator, but she enjoys no charm, and the characters are nowhere near the original film caliber. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a mixture of simple stories and not just interesting stories, which include hilbilly neighbors and fighting tops. Charles Gruden, whom I often like, is very undesirable in the role of the father (who Darren McGavin is skillfully managed by him), and his character never seems to have to. Kernan Kolkin is a poor substitute for Ralph, and the younger brother will be here. It seems that the mother just has any value here, perhaps because of the film director's director of the broth boat when he drives his luck away with angry housewives in the "free dinner night." <br /> <br /> The stories in this are mostly illogical and stretched thin sheet. May appeal to very lenient demands but as a sequel to the Christmas Story, it is a very bad story and does not deserve the time of most people. 2 of 10.
