This film contains some wonderful pictures from Nueri / Newreal, which tells a refreshingly free story of Hollywood's sugar coating, which was possible only because it was basically an independent foreign film. But some scenes last for a very long time (the wedding, especially), and I found that exaggerated dialogue and unrealistic dialogue are more appropriate for the stage of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialog box was particularly distracting, and seems to get worse as the film continues. Most of the characters were either American, Italians or Italian immigrants living in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogue seemed to be playing lines for the Shakespeare play while mixing cement and laying bricks. Near the end, I was laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted me. I think it is possible to defend the flipped hair by saying that the characters spoke Italian, and that the dialogue was a literal translation of how they really spoke. But it did not work for me at all. <br /> <br /> Another line of conversation has made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly picks up a beautiful British accent. I just think that has to do with the fact that the film was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "A" for effort and intention, but a much lower degree of execution.
