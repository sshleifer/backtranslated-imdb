"Unleash Madness" is the worst thing that can happen to classic characters created by Chuck Jones. Lonnie Tunes has many sub-shows and different versions, some good, others not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from performances like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters and boring and bad-made stories. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This offer does not work. This terrible wasting of animation is a complete failure and this should not be more than a bad joke. Lame! Stars zero
