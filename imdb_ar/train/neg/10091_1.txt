I can not believe that this movie was created at all. I think that at some stages the director tries to make it a piece of art, but that makes it worse. Zombies look like they applied a lot of eye makeup. Zombies only in the film for a few minutes. Finally, there may be five or six zombies, and certainly not a nation. The best part of the film, if one is definitely credits because the painful experience ended in the end. Again to repeat other user comments, Voodoo priestesses strange and meaningless in the entire film. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl just makes no sense at all. It has never been explained.
