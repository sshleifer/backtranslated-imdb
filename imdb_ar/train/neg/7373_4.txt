I do not know what the rest of you see, Steven Segal's films, but I watch them because, despite their generosity, they are at least always in good shape to laugh. Why does this movie evaluate one out of 10 films based on dubbing, when this kind of thing is exactly what makes the movie such a movie favoring a cult that you can laugh at silly? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is not a great movie at all, but I felt it deserved a Steven Seagal like many of his other films; in fact I did not think it was one of the worst of a long-range shot. He had, for most of the time, a coherent ground line halfway, and was, for the most part, essentially exciting. The end really sucked, but even some of the items are a pleasant rubbish. In the end, the story itself did not offer what I promised, but I actually believed that acting, characterization (if I could use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​provided exactly what the real Steven Seagal fan expected. Segal himself was precisely the man who had no face and was meaningless and that we expected, and the rest of the actors supported him well, without getting up. This, people, is what Steven Seagal's film does. Treat. Or even better: Laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
