This is not really a zombie movie, if we know zombie as the dead who walks around. Here the protagonist, Armand Loki (played by unbelievably small Dean Jagger), dominates the way to create the zombie, although his "way" is in fact presenting his thoughts mentally and controlling the minds of others who turn them into slave slaves. . This is an interesting concept for a film, and has been more effectively performed by Fritz Lang in his series of "Dr. Mabuse Films," including Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922) and The Doctor of Dr. Mabuse '(1933). Here he is unfortunately linked to an attempt to restore the love of his former fianc√©e, Claire Duval (who played her part in Anne Aich both with a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone) which is already the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a wonderful start, with Louque being sent on a military expedition to Cambodia to end the zombie cult that came from there. In some kind of complex (where we get great collections and clothes from the 1930s), he announced his engagement with Clare, and barely five minutes later, his ring was announced by a poster announcing his love for his country, Clifford Grison (Robert Noland). It is unintentionally funny how they talk to each other without eye contact. This was a great film for "Mystery Science Theater 3000", if it had not already been roasted. <br /> <br /> It never appears how Louque actually learns the secret of "zombification," but then uses it to kill his enemies, creating a giant army of guns carrying soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such absolute power from will until John Agar in The Brain From Planet Arous (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he is allowed to live and return to America. Louque agrees, but in fact turns him into one of his sleeping slaves. On the night of their wedding, he realizes that Claire will start his love only if he gives up his "powers." To earn her love, he does so, causing a "revolution" title, where all his servants wake up and attack his compound and kill him. Clarence Clare embraces, and we seem at the end of the parable: "Who will destroy the gods, they will go mad first." <br /> <br /> So, in fact, not bad for the film, despite the low IMDb rate currently in place. In frequent scenes (?) One can see the artistic in a script well! Dean Jagger has not yet developed into a good actor, hardly recognizable in his youth - is this really his poetry? He is remembered more because of his bald roles, the old man in "White Christmas" (1954), "The Unknown X" (1956) and "The Creole King" (1958). The story quotes a lot of her main themes from the Halperin brothers better. The previous film "White Zombie" (1932), in which Robert Fraser (Charles Beaumont) uses the unhappy "zombie love" to win the love of Madame Bellamy (Madeleine Parker). <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (including hundreds!) I will start with "White Zombie" (1932), "King of the Zombies" (1941), "Walking with Zombi" (1943) "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968), "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) and re-made in the modern era of elegant films, "Horror Express" (1972), "The Serpent and the Rainbow" Days Later "(2002) and sequel, in addition to many, many others also mention many. <br /> <br /> This one is not actually a zombie movie. As such, they rank slightly lower than some of the horror films that were released by Uni Versal in the late 1930s and early 1940s, so I will give it 5.
