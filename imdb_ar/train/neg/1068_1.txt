My wife and I just finished this film and got to IMDb for compatibility with reviewers who found this movie less than satisfactory. However, among the 10 pages of reviews, only a handful are negative. I feel that this film is a terrific concept that ended horribly and I want to warn those looking to watch the film in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit, I am more inspiring to write reviews when I do not like the film than it does when I do, so a bunch of reviews are all negative. However, this does not mean that I am biased not to enjoy a movie, but I often find eloquent comments about the films I enjoy. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most laughable movie I've seen in years. By using the concept of "intelligent" and connecting some great talent in several ways to many short stories, the film ends with the worst of both worlds. It's art for the arts, but something two years old can dream and do. Giving the manager a 5-minute free time from the screen shows why there is a division of labor even in the entertainment industry. Managers can not write, writers can not guide. (I would also stress that Clint Eastwood is overpriced, but that's because he is a representative of a role actor [which rarely works, either}). <br /> <br /> What ends on the screen is a disfiguring mess of stale short stories, unfinished in 5 minutes and in total, spoiling Paris for me. Why do we call it Paris je t'aime when the apropos title is more than the mass f * ck? There are few stories to be seen, most notably Alfonso Cuaron, but everything else will fall into obscurity. Short Coen is allowed briefly, but can you name his film not containing a scene by choosing Guitar? It seems as though all the board members have decided to do whatever they want and have chosen Paris as a place to do so. Since we all love Paris, including the current company, we are a true fact that this film is absorbing. In fact, I think they put the names of the directors in each short film because the directors saw how weak this film and decided to make sure they were only blamed for 5 minutes. seriously. seriously. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not a good actress. It's not a dreamy girl waiting to be waiting for you. Maggie Jellenhal, Why?!? Are you a person acting or just renewing offers from other movies? I look at you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Clauser), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> A final comment on acting: I give Nik Nolti the most vulnerable to acting and searching for more humanity than you have in the ages or perhaps again. You can find his short story on youtube where 5 minutes is very fun. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a few authors have understood them correctly. I think of Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, Ef Scott Fitzgerald, and John Scheffer, to name a few. It is much harder than writing a full novel and only talented people can do it. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only one way out will survive in history. <br /> <br /> If you support Paris as a jewel that you discover and are reflected through your lenses with your own story, do not expect to enjoy this movie at all. Managers either did not care or were lazy. In any scenario, by the time you read it means you have hired it. Thank God you did not pay $ 10 a head in theaters in exchange for that.
