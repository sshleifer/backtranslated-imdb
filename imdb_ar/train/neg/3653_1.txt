I can not help her, but I seem to like movies that are supposed to be scary and very bad. I've personally included him in my worst 10 films under Underworld Creatures! Watch this movie and just laugh and do not expect to see any academic awards for acting. A greater chance to understand the film itself. In all honesty though I saw much worse than this. In addition to some obsessed desert scout wiping the same people who just died is unbelievable that they have to be original. I think it's a love or hate film. You can make up for your terrible yes but they pull it one way or another for that reason I love it
