First, there is nothing wrong with the study of Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic books. There is nothing wrong with making such a film to try to present the Gospel message. So my feelings with this film are not in its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, although I am Aminalnal, I think there will be a great tribulation and I think that Christ will return as he said. Although I do not agree with this film about rapture and this is not the reason why I live this film very low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me make this film very low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, horrible texts, mediocre representation, and FX is pitiful. This film is rated there with some of the richest types of fictional fodder in the 1950s. No, this film is rated below with Plan 9 From Outspace. This film failed to progress well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> End-of-the-world filmmakers had learned not to make final films from this, but they failed. The Left Behind Series, the Apocalypse Series, and the Omega Code Series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated search problem, but their scripts are still poor and are still represented as wood. <br /> <There are a lot of Christian films with very low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the MST3K crew did not make fun of this.
