If this is the first time you are experiencing the wonders of the cinema, if you have not seen a "cartoon" before, you will think that this movie is a child of the gods. But if you've seen a movie, a television program or even Barney the Dinosaur, you will not be very impressed with this movie. Hank Barney was the most realistic dinosaur of the dinosaur in this flick. <br /> <br /> Now I love B movies. I just saw "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I saw this rip, and I liked this movie better. Works as a film. It has lame dialogue, more simple representation, cheesier and honest effects to gosh real monster generation as beast! Carnot 3 just does not pack a lot of punch b movie. He has some loopholes, and this guy Polchek is approaching to be funny several times but this movie is sad, almost .... Loose. It is the small engine that could not film the dinosaurs. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can see drying the gums on the pavement and feeling comfortable. If you are one of these people, give this movie a really.
