This joint British and Spanish production with fantastic stars looks like what you can see from it. I have three versions, two VHS versions, one DVD, all terribly planted, so it looks like the buildings are talking to each other. Some films suffer from a frying pan and scan such a film, where director Robert Parish seemed so fascinated by the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen simultaneously, neglecting the medium. Another user comments that we see all the inhabitants of the church slaughtered at first; not in any of my copies. There are some sudden cuts to farmers who shoot their guns, a Mexican officer was shot, Xu and Landau were celebrating, and that's all. We never found out why Shaw became a priest (if he really was), and we never discovered what happened to Don Carlos (Savalas) even though I think he was called home to be a star in Kojak, where his departure seems arbitrary. There is a strange sequence of the flashback, where Michael Mysterious Island dances in the badboy hat and suit in the tradition of the great old English music hall until 1960 in BATLE OF NEW ORLEANS. Johnny Horton does not sing here but with some words I have never heard of On the positive side, the location is great, a huge ruined castle with Escher ladders that do not lead anywhere, some chew the beautiful scenery of Robert Shaw, and good performances of Stevens, Llandau, Leteri, and Tali Savalas. I did not really like this film, but I did not see it exactly. I will seek a copy and make my decision after that.
