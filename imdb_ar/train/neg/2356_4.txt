The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11, the film industry decided to take advantage of the fact that the spies were present. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch because of the wonderful dance of Eleanor Powell. Miss Powell was certainly a big joke in every sense of the word. I've been paired back with a red Skelton guy looking here. The two also starred in "I Dood It". <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who was wonderful three years later, when the police officer questioned at Mildred Pierce reappeared as an officer asking Powell to hand over an item. The problem is that Olsen and his men are really Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Laar is himself the usual glamor here and gets great support from Virginia O'Brien.
