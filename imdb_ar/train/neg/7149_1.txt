Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a great movie for cars should get paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this flamboyant flare, which evaporates a pile of amateur nonsense. Easily the worst auto movie or any movie ever. This makes Showgirls look like a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take out all the cheese clich√©s from a TV series of the 1980s, put some really lively special effects and lame characters into the background and you have a living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write film shows and produce films but should remain In real estate. <br /> <br /> This is a lame movie with a lame plot and the most prosperous series of motion ever. What bothers me is not that the makers of this film are stupid but they consider the film to become a year as stupid enough to get this nonsense.
