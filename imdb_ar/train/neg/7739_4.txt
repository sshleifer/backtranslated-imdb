Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? Those days feel like more and more memory. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood Homed is no longer a terrible thing, it is a routine film and an amazingly boring friend. It is a comedy that is not particularly funny, and action film is not particularly exciting. Can not obscure excessive abundance in the weakest sub-plans of the central story. <br /> <br /> Ford seems to enjoy at least more than its few recent projects, and is capable of carrying the film most of the time. Hartnett is appropriate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood Homicide" is reasonably armed, but barely. Ford took out, which is not.
