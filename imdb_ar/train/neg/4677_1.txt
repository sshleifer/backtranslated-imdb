What a load of Hollywood left-handed. This film glorifies the insurgency as brave and noble if it is about peaceful principles. The fiction ends with the peaceful character, played by Danzel Washington, and is actually promoted because of his betrayal. What is with these Hollywood gadgets? Is this still a gain for the McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I look sarcastic, I am fed up with films that raise a political agenda. Military brass is filmed in this film, what? Gong is war war. Sounds familiar? Have you ever seen a movie in which the CIA or any government agency is not evil? think about it. Again, Crimson Tide emphasizes this point. The character of Hackman, Captain U-boat Ramsey, happens to be crazy, to the end when, of course, his entire life, 360, abandons his bloody lust, proposes to promote the betrayal Ron Hunter, and repent by retiring from service. Man Rebellion, take command of your boat, and expose the United States to a serious risk of receiving a first nuclear strike, and promote it ???? What a hogwash!
