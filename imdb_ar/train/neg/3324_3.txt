I accidentally saw this lazy summer afternoon. He was playing on the family programming channel of HBO. At first I was attracted to what I thought was a Disney cartoon. But after a few minutes, I found myself looking for a remote control, so I found "INFO BUTTON", to find out what was in the world on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy it in many of his films, but the only thing he does not do is an artist. He certainly has one of the most unique sounds in Hollywood, but it works only as part of a larger visual package. Making his voice attached to a nice duck is a bit difficult to watch. As for the rest of the cast, uninspiring. I assume that working on this film did not attract really good sound to the talent there. <br /> <br /> So, the talent of weak voice, powerful animation ... Who was this film targeted? Ducks gay teens? I do not understand that. Is there really such a shortage of role models for gay and next-generation youth, that we must resort to animated ducks? Nice story, like the title, found this movie difficult to love, just like the ugly duck.
