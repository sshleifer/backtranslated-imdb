I thought this was a wonderful idea, but hey boy, it was poorly executed. We have a broad sense of the complexity and challenge of the scenes of a show, but there is no specific information about any of them. Producers do not seem to find any way to tell a story or give the viewer a "direct line". (This does not mean that they did not try, but the presence of the plays connects a summary to the Ring cycle because the narration of the program does nothing to tell us about the actual composition of the opera.) <br /> <br /> We see a lot of things happening but not being told what to do People and why. There is little sense of who is, or how different production departments fit and work together. For example, we hear several times about a problem of some kind - one expects to see the problem and / or its consequences and / or how to solve it. Instead, filmmakers usually turn to something else (in general, pretty general shots of people pushing things or talking in headphones). <br /> <br /> In general, the film ends up feeling like a picture Which you want to see run under the final credits to show, rather than anything worth seeing for its merit.
