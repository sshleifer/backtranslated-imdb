I have nothing against religious films. I think religious people need something to watch on Saturday evening. But what really distinguishes me is when the writing on a DVD does not refer to this fact to a potential viewer. The display of religious propaganda as entertainment was not wonderful, and our brothers. <br /> <br /> Even if you were a religious person, I had to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was in chaos. He was badly directed, mismanaged, and badly edited, and the attempt was in a funny voice recording. The dialects were horribly fake, the characters were primarily stereotypes, and the continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat in this time-wasting time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. You must have just gone to sleep. <br /> <br /> Certainly you will not be replaced with this film unless you are a religious type who will immediately endorse anything that preaches your beliefs to the infidels, even if it is a pile of rubbish. If not, avoid it at all costs. Do not be fooled by the writing box.
