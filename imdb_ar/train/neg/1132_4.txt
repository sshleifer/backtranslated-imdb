The goal of the largely extended preparatory phase of this story is the Born Born story, and it seems to make final success more generous. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young girl who is not imprisoned within herself but has never been convinced that she is the theatrical actress of the growing fame that overcomes profits and benefits from this separation. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting classes, we did not see her implement the teacher's instructions. Having suffered from Esther's pain (which caused itself to a great extent) with alarming details, we did not give a convincing sense of victory. <br /> <br /> The obsessive presence of heroine pain seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. However, the causes of this pain (poverty, semi-autism, Judaism, and sexual betrayal) are never combined in a coherent entity. A 163 minute film with a simple plot must be able to sew loose ends. Esther was still not ready to go before the public.
