There are people who will shine the green light on anything! This is the only explanation I can give of why the film "House of the Dead" is present. This is just a scary part of the entire film. It is very bad that the films explode forever. I desperately wanted to turn off this device and turn the TV into a Paint Drying Channel, but I was committed to suffering everything. I do not know why I do these bad things for myself. <br /> <br /> As if it were important, here is the basic idea of ​​"story." There is a group of 20 very desperate things to go to some of the islands in the Northwest Pacific (actually Canada, because it is cheap) for "Rave of the Century" (which consists of about 8 people and non-quiet music) There is yet to miss the main phrase. This must be some rave to be worth all the dough! The hunter warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hung on I thought this was the house of the dead?) And they are all condemned yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The first drawbacks are here. Why would the small little rave (from the century to my feet!) Be held on a remote island? Why does anyone pay close sums to get them? Why pay more to the noisy old fisherman to retrieve them when they can return with others? <br /> <br /> Once they arrive, they discover that this delirium (which consists of about 2 tents, is a small stage and a john has been smashed), there is blood everywhere and no one is nearby. What would anyone think rational? Run for their lives of course. But no, those blind ignorant people decided to look for them. They soon discover a dilapidated old house 50 times inside as it is outside. After another half hour of stumbling into the woods, as an excuse to kill some small characters, after much boredom they returned home again. Characters, like the movie, do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> The confusion in this horrific disaster is a huge abundance of weak dialogue, heinous representation, the presentation of mumbo-jumbo, and zillion of the passages from the famous arcade game of the same name day. Why was this universally accepted as a good idea with directors I would never know. The sections contain no reference to any of the scenes and only further deteriorate the waste, if possible. <br /> <br /> Nothing to do with the game except for some cheap and near-end lines. It makes resident evil like film glory. Hell, even Double Dragon seems to deserve multiple Oscars compared to this junk. The only one who comes out of this still intact is Jürgen Prochnow. He could have taken his money and ran, but tried to do his best with the terrible script line and added a little bit of lament to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are stupid and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you cut the meaningless winter nudity, I see no reason why this movie should not be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not scary at the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is the most frightening of the skeletal villains in this movie. And where did all these bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I think this justifies why they chose to reuse the footage over and over again. I do not understand it, you'll see zombie himself die dozens of times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately to blame for this frightening virtue of celluloid? Nothing but the director Oy Paul. His control of the film does not exist. You can clearly see actors who have no idea what they should do and that zombies do not take it seriously. The actors seem to read card cards because they always stop in the middle of the long sentences and continue talking as soon as they see the next card. Everything seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> In addition to filming the movie as a mini-series of two parts. I've already seen better TV productions. Do not make me start editing. The film is an incoherent Babli with thousands of thousands of senseless clips and dozens of senseless camera tubs. No real skill or talent placed in making this at all. It's really puzzling about how bad films are made and George Romero can not make anyone who receives his calls. House of the Dead refers to some stupid references to Romero in a lazy attempt to be "postmodern", but they only bother that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what's worth it, the visual image looks distorted 1.85: 1 is fantastic, Dolby 5.1 soundtracks are clean but very ineffective and only work on the highly used ADR pronunciation. DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Is not this review a warning enough? stay away! All of you are doomed to tell you! Sentenced! Sentenced !!!
