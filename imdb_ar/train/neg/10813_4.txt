The first half of this release was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre). Jane's childhood development and personality were exceptional. After that, it looked as if someone had said "ah, that's too long" and broke the rest of the story into objects. The main scenes, when included at all, are polished, merged and placed outside the system in a way that completely changes the story of the film. There was little moving or even developing the scene so it would be difficult for anyone unfamiliar with the story to even follow it. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened a lot of hope, and then the end put it down.
