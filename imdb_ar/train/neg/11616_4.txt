I did not enjoy the movie Ya Joshua at all. Maybe that's because I saw a much better similar movie called Orphan two days ago, but maybe it was just because the film was not good. I'm going with a ladder. Sure, a wicked child plot is not exactly the original but that does not mean that the film can not succeed. It could have been exciting, fun and scary, but instead the building was slow, dull, quiet, and did not let me think of anything more than "not so good" when it ended. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motives are revealed. I will not give up, but the truth is that he did not really achieve his goals because, despite Vera Farmege, where his mother Abe disappeared about 3/4 during the film, all the shares indicate her return home soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then accused Joshua's father / husband of manipulating her equipment, which tells the public that the institution realizes that she was in fact not mentally ill but medically treated. So .. should not you go home soon? Joshua will not fail? Would not his mother live with his sister and probably his father soon? I have asked the father since his future became open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I did not care about personalities. Evil demon child Joshua was not really scary. The story moved slowly and when it was still boring. The suspense fell flat every time. When it ended I could not believe I had sat in everything. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Just because the acting was good from parents and especially Vera Farmiga as a mother but if you want to watch a movie about a wicked "kid", look for the orphan. Now the film took a non-original concept and produced a great film.
