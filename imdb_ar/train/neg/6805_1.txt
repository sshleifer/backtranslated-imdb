I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago ... well, I still can not believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film ever. If I include all the flaws in the film, this review will take me a lot of sentences (very funny flaws, because they are too bad). <br /> <br /> You should be surprised by the commando skill of saving the plane. They did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is a very bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is how production wanted to be like a hero, but it's zero. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main drawbacks will be Landing a 747 plane, which only needs 3 or 4 tips from a man moving to landing in the plane ... amazing .. as well as dead objects that have almost no blood .. <br /> <br /> But I highly recommend watching this Film, because it is very interesting to see how bad something can happen
