I was expecting this to be much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was excited to watch these short films online. Well, they were not at all what I was expecting. <br /> <br /> I do not really know what I do not like. I think they're just boring. The sound bothers me, most characters, although I loved Roy The Toxic Boy, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> Match Girl may have prevented me more, although it was very funny. <br /> <br /> I also do not like the way some characters die. Such as how Match Match ignites the fuel station primarily, or how the girl who stares generally dies. Roy's death was amazingly entertaining. Death by car freshener. Very original ;-) This made me laugh hard ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just some language and humor. That's all I have to say! 10/03
