This is not the worst film I've ever seen about Peter Greenaway but he's close. This shame goes to the book of the worst pillows. The films of this 3 director I have seen are all miserable. Such as The Cook ..., regardless of the positive cinematic prosperity it presents, can not be fully drawn by its material and its overall presentation.
