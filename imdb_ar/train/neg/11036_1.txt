The program must be smart on air. Maybe this is the escape of Jim Belushi and all his bad films. His brother sucked all the talent that was the younger brother. I hope this offer is canceled and will not be spoken again except in negative use. Jim has a retirement or something. Please allow them to leave the air. If you joke here from this show I will throw and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. Rather than being taken identifier of the devil himself from watching half an hour full of that piece of programming. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air. We all know that we want to shoot our own television screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
