I found this movie very strange. From the beginning, I found it very difficult to love this movie, and now after a bit of thinking about it, I can pinpoint the reason for it pretty much. Jean-Marc Bar, although I liked it a bit (I think Zentropa is one of the best films ever made) but it's totally wrong here, and although I can not live better than I do, I'm sure someone can That took his place very easily and made this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for the stings in the weak comedy (there is no need for a joke "Meet the Parents" Really O Filmmakers!) And really loved Richard E. Grant as a British pioneer. He suffers only from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
