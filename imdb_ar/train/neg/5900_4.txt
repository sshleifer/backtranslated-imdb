Japanese youth and attractive in the wrong direction of some curse began again, this time involving mobile phones. Different people die until the disillusioned spirit is discovered behind all this, so if you've seen more than two Japanese horror movies recently, you can draw this movie in the dark with your hands. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Mickey is behind the camera. I have been impressed by his low workings such as City of Lost Souls, yet I have thought of One Missed Call along the way I craved the most famous envelope that paid the Dead or Alive or Audition's highly false Audition style. Although many of his films are essentially empty, they enjoy at least the advantages of such, or at least something that draws your attention like Tadanobu Asano flocking in the shiny suits posing as Johnny Depp's character. There is nothing in one missed call; there is very little credit: representation is nice and mediocre, and there is very little (nothing, honestly) in the way of fear or suspense, and sometimes it is quite boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments in which the Miike glacier-like humor permeates through pleasant business activity; most notably with the television show's intention to depict the demise of a damned subject, the TV programmer is more interested in his assessments of girls' lives. But apart from this, there is nothing to suggest that Mick is behind the camera. More importantly, his usual visual taste has disappeared without a trace (including his famous guru), although he probably has no enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One missed call is not bad offensive. It's just a frustrating average. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Miek likes steering. Through its huge annual production, it is clear that it will not care 100% of all its projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt he was paying the bills.
