After referring to the film, I recently watched this film on TCM, hoping to get a less appreciative gem, since I consider many films from the thirties. This is not a gem - not even semi-precious. The outdated clothes and 1930 'Rolls Royce Limo hit you right away. Casting is strange, too. But mostly, there are a lot of stupid and unnecessary drawing devices. This film contains a lot of good ingredients and a basic plot carrying the promise, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the correct recipe. It simply does not come together as it should. This is a shame. With some obvious, but minor, modifications, this may have been a very good film. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around an American girl (Jean Harlow) looking for a wealthy British husband - preferably from the nobility. Frances meets Ton and his friend, who are on a tomb in Rolls-Royce owned by his employer's friend. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns Rolls, and puts her gaze on him. This early part of the film is a light comedy with no real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tone inadvertently reveals the fact that the employer is already a German columnist on the eve of World War I, when the film completely changes and begins to collapse. Tone and Harlow get married, but at the start of the honeymoon, he is shot by Mata Harry (Benita Hume) and Harlow escapes from the scene with a bystander accusing her of killing Ton. (In fact, Tone is recovering from the wounds.) Harlow escapes to France, where she falls in love again - this time with a Cary Grant. The tone, now in the army, was brought back and Harlow unexpectedly back into Grant's room where he was in Rehab from a plane crash. In the next scene, Ton Harlow is accused of abandoning him because it is essentially a mine. Harlow never explained the witness who accused her of murder and panic! This is one of the unrealistic details that is based on the conspiracy apparatus of films in the story. <br /> <br /> Tone was then returned to the Hume woman who shot him. She is on hand to watch her vanity, Grant, as she tests the new plane that Tun has handed over from England. Unbelievably, both Hume and Tone know each other faintly, but simply can not identify where! Well, the tone was shot and almost dead; maybe his memory is a bit of a beating. But how many men shot Hume who would have forgotten one of her signs? (It does not seem to be a memory break.) <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have known him perfectly, but she played a strong role when she realized that Toon had not been able to put her. It would have been much better to address the issue. <br /> <br /> And the end is not very satisfactory. The film, as it was made, conspires with Tone and Harlow to maintain the good reputation of Cad, Grant, resulting in his phony burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just walk away. It is noble to maintain the French public perception of the hero of the National War, but it is very unacceptable as a love story! <br /> <br /> What the film poses is this: Harlow explains that she fled in a state of panic in her face charges of murder; a tone forgiven her and quietly salutes his love for her; then carries her torch, even while helping her to rig the crash site to maintain a reputation Grant. In the meantime, Harlow finally recognizes Grant Cady. After witnessing the "tone" of the brave and noble man, Harlow rekindles his feelings as well. At the end of the film, they are reconciled even while working together to falsify the appearance of Grant's death. After Grant's hero is buried, we see them embracing and accepting as they fade away. It would make a nice little movie. For Cary Grant fans, it would have been better if Tone played the role of the French player who killed and Grant the long-suffering partner, and did not share it with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is portrayed as an Irishman living in England, while Carrie Grant is cast as a Frenchman. This film would have been much better if they had reversed the roles. As it would have been more suitable for a film that should have been ...
