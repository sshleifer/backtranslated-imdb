** Vandals ** A bit of irony made in a television film that has a sexy and medium-sized gold digger Isabelle Collins, Suzanne Tucci, doing a number for every man that comes into contact with him in the film. First, they win their hearts and then their wallets, and when they have no benefit to them, they are thrown into the trash like used Kleenex tissues. <br /> <br /> The first victim of Isabel is not another, then offensive, to keep Isabel from raiding his bank account, Stuart's husband, John O'Hurley. Later in the film, when Isabelle co-existed with the former plumber, now the salesman of the Richard Davis yacht, Philip Kasnov, she, without really telling him, got Richard, who was sick with love, a contract on her reassuring marriage life. Upon obtaining this previous conviction, in fact once he was released from prison, Dagget and Nicholas Campbell discovered to do the job at Stuart Richard soon that he did not get exactly what he paid, at $ 15,000.00 in cash, for. <br /> <br /> Getting a little greedy Daggett has not only corrupted Stuart's brains, but also took a solid gold watch, which Stuart offered to maim his life as well. The clock was easily tracked to Daggett while trying to mortgage her in a local jewelry store where he was quickly arrested. With Dougette pouring his grief over who he hired to hit Stuart, it would not take long for Stuart's arm of law to be arrested, by appointing Dougette, Isabel's killer husband to be a plumber and salesman for Richard Davis! Davis's arrest occurs by the police just as he and Isabel have taken the promise of marriage at a local church! <br /> <br /> Isabelle manipulates everyone, exclusively the men who wear heels for her, in her favor by getting her. To do its dirty work. Always play the role of a naive housewife, widow, lover or even client Isabel seems to be living a charming life always one step ahead of the law and the police. No matter what she does, Isabelle covers it so well that it is almost impossible to identify any of them, in making others do so, with many of the crimes committed by a second party in the film. <br /> <br /> After the tension, figuratively and literally, her first husband Stephen knows her second husband, for less than ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or lawyer Richard Gavin Kindrick, Camar de los Reyes, Isabel knows it is just a matter of time before Become her wise ruler. With both getting Richard and Kendrick to turn the evidence against her Isabelle now knowing that everything quickly closes in on her makes her final move. To get everything in order, by transferring all her money abroad, Isabelle and her daughter Robbie, 10-year-old Lorraine Collins, dropped the Passport Office to get a permit, passports and exit the country. <br /> <br /> Then, when Isabelle is wise and intelligent, she makes her first and probably the last and most deadly mistake in the film. Isabelle told the passport clerk, Don Carrier, that she would have to wait 48 full hours to clear her passport and ruby! Enough time for the police to find her and arrest her! The strange ending that runs counter to almost everything and every ethic is present in the film Noir or Crime Movie. The end will not only blow your mind, but your concept of right and wrong in the world!
