Shakespeare's plays are best known, I've been seriously allowed here. The bad direction, stagnant studio work and irregular performances spoil a wonderful tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the town of Verona, the Capitol and Montagis have been wrestling for centuries, but the tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Riccart), Montague is in love with Juliette (Rebecca Sayer), Capolet. The bloodshed soon erupts ... <br /> <br /> The studio, especially in the daytime scenes, is working dangerously. It is a story worthy, thanks to its energy, to be photographed outdoors. In conjunction with these hideous costumes, with lots of tights and scriptesses. The battles on the stage seem appalling, with so much running and stretching that it is not so attractive. <br /> <br /> Patrick Riccard is so lightweight that Romoya is not really effective. He manages the intensity of the personality when the plot begins, but his tone is luxurious and gentle, and often limit the eyes that are not expressed by how terrified. It is very difficult for the public to communicate with Romeo. Rebecca Sayer is so young that Juliet does not make her good - she embodies the naivet√© of personality, but more tenderness was welcome. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles do not perform much better. Joseph O'Connor Farris Lawrence was fine but many of his best lines were cut. Mercutio belongs to Anthony Andrews on stage and not on the camera. It grows and removes excessively and seems somewhat absurd as a result. Alan Rickman, who reduces his role, has almost no presence. I have developed edge and intensity to make some beautiful screen presentations in subsequent years, but this is not a guide here. The prince can play a great role in his short appearances, but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any power over the camera. Michelle Hordern only, in his best role in this series, comes out of this with all dignity. Capulet features a good play and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story instead.
