First and foremost to keep my personal feelings off the road, let me begin by saying that I hate the so-called comedy, where every character is written and played so stupid that you flounder if all are caused by the marriage of relatives. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to say that I watched the first three films of American Pie, and while it was not the most amazing film I've ever seen, it was fine (and the clear-cut novels compared to three American films "Pie Making" I still have to ask what they were thinking of in Hell when they did this film? <br /> <br /> I also have some other questions as well. <br /> <br /> Whoever thinks this was an acceptable use of studio money and production resources ? <br /> <br /> Who agreed to the final text (and what did this person smoke when he agreed)? <br /> <br /> Finally, why did anyone think that he was ashamed S to be released in theaters where the average cost of admission ranges between $ 10 and $ 15 depending on where you live when you should go directly to the Blockbuster or Wal Mart discount box? <br /> <br /> There is a big mistake This film so much that I can not write a comprehensive review of it because it will exceed the maximum allowed for words in this forum, so I will only touch on the biggest things you miss. <br /> <br /> The plot is general uninspiring and stupid and the characters are all as interesting as watching the paint Java for 80 minutes but the biggest thing I can see wrong in this movie is acting. <br /> <br /> Although most actors are not nameless, they are likely to be forgotten within a few years. <br /> <br /> The only and only name in this film is Eugene Levy, who spends most The time is almost on the screen with this familiar laugh on his face that tells the viewer, "I know this is not funny and I miss my talents, but hey, I'll get paid for it, so who cares" does not even try to make any of his jokes funny Garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the rest of the actors are appalling, although some of them were on some really wonderful TV shows. However, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays an extremely intolerable and disturbing character Things you can teach to tropical skin diseases) so much so that you almost wish to die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) hanging around the screen and dissipating what he has talent through his presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next movie in this series will just be a soft core porn with the story line so they can wander around the MPAA and get an R rating that extends this movie to a vulgar level of senseless nudity and senseless sexual content that it should have been He earned an X rating (the label plate should be drunk or drugged when they reviewed this film to assess it). <br /> <br /> Interestingly enough, twenty-five years ago when Wes Craven made a nightmare in Elm Street to the MPAA to review the ratings they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of footage (I think they were part of a death scene that contained silicone molding In order to avoid getting the X rating. He had no choice but to do so or the movie would not be shown. <br /> <br /> But this kind of unnecessary offensive trash can get the R rating today because it is All in the name of comedy, if this film was a dramatic film or horror with this kind of content there would have been a very unpleasant smell about the content Wii was going to get the dreaded X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really bothers me is writing, this movie is written to play like a wet dream of a twelve-year-old boy with an overly sexual imagination and a very young Normal crass, almost every explanatory position that is supposed to move the body in this film requires drawing along the telegraph so that any intelligent viewer can see it within a mile, and the alleged characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes, do not care about disgusting sexual references and unnecessary scenes The perverse sex behavior seems to have been written by this film in some breakthrough The first year is incompetent in separate writing film low rent. <br /> <br /> It's time to kill this series before it gets any more crass and offensive idiots, this cake is filled with apples the way.
