Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I started watching the show for the first time I thought it was good. But plots have worsened. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the hottest person in the show. How can a mother treat her son this way, well if she is the daughter in law, but that was her son. I give this offer 4/10 just because the first few presentations were a little funny. Actors Constance Marie and Massilla Lusha do a wonderful job. I do not know how to play these shows for a long time. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored as you are and you do not have something else to watch, I suggest you watch this.
