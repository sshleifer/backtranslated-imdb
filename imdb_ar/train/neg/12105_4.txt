This was a disappointing film. It seems that people do not have any content, the protagonist Martin Cahill has no zero compensatory values, in fact everyone in it including John Voight summarizes the softness. I do not recommend this film to anyone. Violence is humiliating, although it has been carried out brilliantly. Black photography, at least that the printing I saw fit this category. Disappointment.
