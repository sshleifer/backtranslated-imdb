Well, it was probably Artferrati who had liked this movie but I'm not afraid. If you like the type of film in which the shots go on for so long that you wonder if the actor has been sleeping or the photographer went for lunch, it might be for you. Much of it is like this with a short sleep in the world of hate. I did not find it as shocking or disturbing as some other reviewers did - simply disliked and a little useless. The only reason I did not give this one star was that the acting was commendable and the film was well shot. The plot, however, has nothing to recommend. Much of the film is just an angry woman teaching or listening to the piano, which may attract some people. But, lest you think this is harmless enough, get ready for some pornographic footage and sexual violence just to wake you up with bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
