First of all: I love Splattermovies very well and am not afraid to communicate with art, but this budget-free budget is by no means! The quality of the picture is very low, and the soundtrack is the most disturbing I have heard (!!!!), as for the FX ... the very low quality makes some of them not as bad as if they were in a real movie (what this scrap is not). There is no concept, a thin story, primitive acting and a rare dialogue - I think I calculated about 10 sentences in the entire film, each repeated about 20 times ... the same for many film sequences (may be indicative of what kind of audience these craps were made !!!) The story seems to lie in that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, and hurt myself, and when an adult goes on a tour, he exhibits self-mutilation. So far, very good ... But for those fake managers, this plot is just a line to put shock scenes cheap in a row and have no meaningless message (newly extracted intestine) thrown on naked naked woman in the pit of the earth ... Why? And why is the only time she sees every woman and throw in the whole bloody "movie" ??? Disturbance? Yes really!! Illness? Yes really!! Necessary? No! Technically? No!!!!! Anyone who makes a mistake in this cheap art show should visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch The Wall Pink Floyd to see how a similar theme can be found in a shrewd way ... I hope this is your first subject and the last movie (!!!!!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! Everything you wear, remember: Not everything that seems cheap and obviously makes no sense at all is "art" automatically ...
