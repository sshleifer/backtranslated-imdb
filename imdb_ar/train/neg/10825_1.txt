What made the idea of ​​watching this film very attractive was the hope that it would live up to the brilliance of Charlotte Bronte in the original classic story. I was very disappointed when I found that this film, which seemed to be either written or hastily filmed, did not have the qualities that made the original novel very powerful. It seems that many ingenious things back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, are either missing from the script or left on the floor of the cutting room. She also lost Jane Eyre's sense of attraction, which enabled her to suffer from her disorder and her victory over everyone. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The women in this film do not seem to have much to win, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane escapes from Thorhenfeld and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her weariness in having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, and moving away from the man she loved, in my opinion, the moving parts of the story were simply left out of this film. The title character seems dry and uninspiring. The story was unattractive and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story will be the least interesting. Scenario and directing did little if any for the classic story.
