I am very happy and was surprised that there is a lot of interest in this film! Jack Frost was an introduction to films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything that this company deals with is pure nonsense! First, this is very important, you have never seen this movie! Why will? Unlike many other bad films, this film was deliberately bad. I can not outweigh the fact that the snowman is fake, which is why he always shows only briefly, and the way he moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton piece of crap, because it was made to be a very good film, and this version is so bad.
