Make 0 bags of German puzzles! Well, when I started to watch this bag of coal, it was the afternoon on Sunday, and I was looking for things at the time of the show. I met a hot nude babe, and like anyone (I'm a young man, my sisters e-mail ...) I was happy. But then they threw everything at the dogs, spat at it, set it on fire, and extinguished it. Want to know how? Dr Dolls! The dialogue throughout the film was terrible. It looked like something a 2 grade BRO can see. The violence was nice for some scenes, but some were completely offended. The scene in the hole was giving the knife man ... stupid idiot! Bottom line, this is a pure cinemas drenched in chocolate syrup known as nudity, topped with cherries of horrible acting as a pornstar can only make.
