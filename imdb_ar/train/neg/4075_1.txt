I'm weird in the horror film / Gore and this flick was so bad, I felt embarrassed not only "for the actors", but also for the director and the weak sings of the producer who has already put his money into this impasse. /> <br /> From the title, you expect some great massacre, somewhat of a story and at least some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like a three-ring stooges more violent and sexual. At least I laugh at the three gigglers. While watching this trailer, I turned on another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept watching Stern. <br /> <br /> Watching this "movie" I realized that I could produce a movie with three monkeys, DV cameras, $ 50 from a sudden change, and a broken computer. This film is an inspirational source for entering the film industry without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... There is not much here, but there is a lot of talk and little work. This makes "KaZaam" looks like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany has not banned it because of sex or violence. Other countries need attention.
