Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst films ever produced. But not that kind of bad film. This is so wonderful it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas obviously has no lucrative career in acting. Must return to gymnastics. But who can forget such memorable scenes like the high bar with chalk or stone horse or chase scene five minutes through the village of madness in slow motion. I do not think it was supposed to be that bad, but who can say. It's not an art, but if you want something light and thin that would make a good conversation, I rented a gymakta. Makes for an evening of fun.
