This film was eccentric. I was not emotionally involved in every single character so much that the biggest discount of films was, in fact, myself. I played beautifully all the time. I prepared myself, but I would drink another beer only in the hope that it would magically turn into something that went all the way. Even in this case, I could only notice that Cuba's behavior was as flimsy as the paper of research. His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincing, as well as a one-night concert after failing his stupid standards. Burt came on the screen as a general, that's right, General (wearing a lot of make-up). I fell in a frightening fast tendency to compete with Cuba, except for me it was real and I stopped my toe. Compensation! Retrieve my stubborn toe!
