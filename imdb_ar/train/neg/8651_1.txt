I watched the first 15 minutes, and I thought it was a real documentary (with a very sexy product "on the camera" irritating). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was shown I thought "Why would I waste my time watching this junk?" So I turned it off and got the Internet to warn others. The characters do not behave in a reasonable manner. Too much immature emotion. For a man traveling halfway around the world to a war-torn country, act like a child. I do not think the reason is that "his character was very angry at the mall bombings." <br /> <br /> Vulgar and very stupid. <br /> <br /> Have you seen "Lost City of Children"? A dark French fantasy film about a man kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I loved it!
