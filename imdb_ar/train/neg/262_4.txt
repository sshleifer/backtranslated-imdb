Jimmy Fox is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold in order to get the first major leadership role in the budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chappell, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotypical producers who believe that black males who commit crimes are a pretty funny concept (see: Money Talk, Blue Strik). <br /> <br /> Well, I have laughed several times and given all these comedians a continued hilarious role, but I would like to see these men diverging from the portrayal of Ala Marlon and Ayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or in the live color band Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans as they perform performances in the spelling of Spike Lee Bamboozled.
