I am skeptical and irreparable, and I was expecting to enjoy this film. After watching it, I sincerely believed that I could have done a better documentary. Her arguments seem to contain only four false sources (though included in the list of credits on the IMDb I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), co-edited together with the effects of a laughable comic computer, and making even the slightest attempt to appear neutral. The narration is spread around with anti-Christian sentiment almost ironically, which destroys any possibility that the film may actually alter someone's mind rather than just preaching the chorus (ie I). Although there is some interesting debate about the history of Jesus, the film suffers an unbearable ending when he begins to focus heavily on the Christian school attended by the director as a child, an institution that seems to have been badly deformed by the psychologist because it disturbs him today. <br /> <br /> Although the TGWWT has a clearly low budget, there is still a chance here to make a clever comment on the very dubious roots of Christianity. There is certainly scarcity in skeptical religious documentaries in the market, and this film helped fill the void. Instead, the manager chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end seemed to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is very bad that his Christian education shocked him, but he does not need to subject the public to the mechanism of dealing with him.
