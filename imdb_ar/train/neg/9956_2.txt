I made a special effort to watch this movie and I was quite disappointed with the result. The scenario seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope - I loved Pacino in Scent of a Woman and I saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in many French movies and other 1970s and 1980s. But I forgot how important dialogues can play any part in the film, and in this film you will be ..... absolute waste! The locations were also attractive, but the desperate, debilitating and forced dialogues pushed the whole thing to zero. In addition, I am very sensitive to the world of motor racing and I do not care about the sport. Even the intangible dialogues in "Love Story" were better than the dialogues in this film (and that's saying something !!). I was really expecting the best of this film and I was very disappointed because I failed a lot.
