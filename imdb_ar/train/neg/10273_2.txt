When it comes to horror movies, I'm more than willing to comment on disbelief, ignore production values ​​below the level, and overlook the holes of the plot in favor of good fear. These films simply have no good concerns to offer. You can not even enjoy it as a camp. The dialogue was bad, bad behavior, bad direction, unpredictable fighting and poor implementation, the music was annoying, the work was miserable in the camera, and even bad fashion. I felt bad for the actors, who were clearly trying, but they had to deal with a terrible dialogue and a clear lack of direction. I doubt they got any rehearsal, either. It is embarrassing to watch, which is very boring to reach the supposed "sudden" end that requires tremendous tolerance. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not write reviews naturally, but it was so bad that I felt I had to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you should watch this movie, do not miss the "Make of" feature. It seems that the writer / director had the impression that making the killer a woman was a kind of bold and bold movement. (Seen). The actors spend half an hour dismantling this film as if it were a new era of "citizen citizen". It's like listening to a group of third-graders taking you backstage from their Christmas contest. They really believe they have created something of substance. It is really sad? The only reason I have given this movie "2" is that I think "1" should be dedicated to real atrocities, such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst film I have ever seen, but I must say that somewhere in the last half.
