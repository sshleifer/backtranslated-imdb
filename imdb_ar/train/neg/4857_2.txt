I really love ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with very low-budget movies and I have enjoyed films with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, check out "Wiseguys vs. Zombies" if you're interested). In fact, I prefer the low-budget zombie movies, because I doubt that Hollywood directors do not understand what a zombie is. "" <br /> <br /> But the ZB3 was so bad. He was retarded. I do not want to bother to be gracious in my criticism I want to retrieve 90 minutes, etc., but it only took about 80 minutes, because putting part of the road to 1.4X fast forward. <br /> <br /> Well, here's some criticism. 1. The speed was awesome. Everyone spoke in a monologue. Even when someone has one line, the camera works, editing and inserting a bunch of F bombs into each sentence making the font feel like a monologue. Initially I was excited to run for 90 minutes compared to 70 minutes for the ZB1, but in fact there were fewer "events" in the ZB3. Everything is talking. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore has got stupid effects. Just rub around the belly of people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic presentation, there was no real conspiracy. The exhibition is actually epic! You will not spoil it, if you are watching it. (You do not see it.) But then, it's just a bunch of lame characters who roam and bicker for about 80 minutes. Or less, if you choose to do so.
