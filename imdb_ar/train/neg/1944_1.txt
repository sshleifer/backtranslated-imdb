I grew up with Scooby Doo all my life, my parents grew up with Scooby Doo. We have just seen the first episode of the farce calling itself Shaggy and Scooby getting an idea. What planet is Warner Bros. to allow for this evils in the air. Characters may be better than my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my 3-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are not just !!!!! If anyone except Cassie Kassem is making an audible noise, people will not work !!! Trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was walking. What's new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change the shape of victory. Ben this piece of trash and go back to the real Scooby
