What begins as a gentle country spinster changes the mildly unpleasant and mildly pleasant tale. Harlan magically reveals Edward Norton gradually more about himself and turns things into a villain, as the film gradually turns from a southern love story into a modern Western wilderness. <br /> <br /> Touring a Norton farm in town and enchanting a young girl (Ivan Rachel Wood), she seems to be saving her from a dead end with her ill-tempered father with a stormy love story, but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to it than this Which cowboys see more than eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton? A real chameleon actor (with a change of facial hair to match) plays with a country game, a slightly elusive tone but perhaps because he just tries to act without worrying about the tone. It certainly makes it seem stressful to make all the subtle little adjustments while learning more about Harlan. However, with a lot of small changes, it means we are never quite sure where Harlan comes from and what seems to be a good performance of Norton is confusing. Ivan Rachel Wood is pet without having to really have much to do other than her belly bat at Norton. <br /> <br /> Strikes "fall in the valley" as a story is a little uneven because of its tempo change, and never really make the hero's motives clear public sympathy with the characters are still uncertain. Should we love this lost or not? Even after a dramatic shift in events, it is not clear. This mystery is at the expense of the film, as if the writer could not decide what type of story they wanted to narrate and settled in a somewhat hot pot. If the film remains one or the other, it may be a solid film, but what remains is a mess. Old romance lovers will enjoy part of the film, but will be delayed in a dark tone. Entire Norton enthusiasts (or lovers of the lush landscaping of the San Fernando Valley), gave this their beauty.
