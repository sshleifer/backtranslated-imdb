This film is flawed on many fronts. Like so much before him, it portrays the Alamo legends more than history. Production is poor, generally giving the impression of a care project for many actors who may have had to work in Hollywood boxes. For me this was the biggest drawback - I know the ages and public figures of the real Alamo heroes and the older group of television actors chosen to photograph them, never hinting at any hint of ratification. Texan, I grew up with legends. I later learned more about history. I can accept decent production from either perspective (although I prefer a more historical accuracy), but this has never given me a chance to enjoy it. Even the John Wayne or Fess Parker versions had a longer life than this rigid mess, while they were a bit less accurate. <br /> <br /> Too disappointing - avoid them.
