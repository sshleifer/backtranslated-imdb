This film certainly disappoints me. It was a wonderful concept that was destroyed by a terrible text. The story did not flow and was disjointed at best. There were many elements of this story that were not explained, or were forced to put it without any real thought. Elements such as love story could be expanded a bit more, the guns must be better written. The main character in her growth needed more training and less standing. Everyone loves a good story of "Overcoming the Little Man" and this showed promise but with scripting failure it was not. Although there were some fireworks in the final battle sequence, they were dim due to lack of choreography design. This made for an incredibly boring hour <br /> <br /> It could have been very good :(
