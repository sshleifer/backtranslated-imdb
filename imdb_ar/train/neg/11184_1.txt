It's a really terrible film. <br /> <br /> I write this only until it is delayed to see it somewhere. If you stop one person from wasting some of his precious life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Mired relentlessly, although because of the Al Pacino stars, I was deceived to believe that at any moment there was something interesting going on. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I had been completely deceived in watching this incredible car. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film has achieved a high score as it did in IMDb (more than 5 stars when last post vote). Are you a cynical person? <br /> <br /> Please, please, please do not watch this movie!
