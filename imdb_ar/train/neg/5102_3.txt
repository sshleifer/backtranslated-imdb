Nicole Egert has been listed as a star of this, although Michelle Dorn and Stacy Kate are larger stars than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, there's some twist in the movie Alien Lands on Earth. Eger plays the role of the girl who feels sorry for a foreigner being stalked by the army and receiving the unruly creature in her very exciting dress. There is little nudity and partial nudity, a senseless sexual scene, all showing up along the way. <br /> <br /> The movie stumbles through several clear sets and ongoing jokes about displaying images. I liked the jokes done by Star Trek when Michael Dorn was captured and got a terrific scene of death. <br /> <br /> It was fairly clear that Stacey Kate would take over the film and that the film had a weak end. It was nice to show exactly what kind of talent the foreigner had brought to Eggert.
