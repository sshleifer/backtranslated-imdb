I saw this movie just yesterday. <br /> <br /> My friend wanted to see him only because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm wasting my time and money and I told my girlfriend that it's the last time we go to see a movie just because there's a certain actor / actress in it. I hope you learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. For me, ever since I paid, I wanted to see the end at least, in the hope that something good would appear, but I did not hold my breath, and fortunately, I would be a victim of the same film. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it's a black and white film. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his captors, and all sex offenders are portrayed as irreconcilable hardcore criminals, but the bad guys were very bad. He spoke of clich√©s and the exploitation of typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's representation was as good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace him was a desire at best. Not entirely convincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to take advantage of a common appearance and give it a cheap, exciting and exciting cycle that is completely unrealistic. They only use sex offenders as a pretext to indulge in cheap, violent killings such as murder, beatings, rape and torture - which seems almost justified. They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - to what extent they can get it. <br /> <br /> The film will not be released in the United States and will go directly to DVD. This had to stay in other countries as well, but because in Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it. Believe me, without a gear, the movie is not even worth a B-series movie.
