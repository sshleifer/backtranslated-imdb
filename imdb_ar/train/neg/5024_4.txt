There is not much to say about this. Gammera is a kind of turtle breathing fire. It has been lost by a nuclear explosion. Head to the ground and start to destroy buildings, tanks and other waste (Oh, power lines. I almost forgot). At one point, early in the film, he became a friend of a little boy, instead of throwing him away or crushing him, putting him on the ground. Safe. From then on, we have to watch this chubby who faces a little excitement and runs away, shows up and runs away, shows up and runs away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this baby of 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the plot is trying to get Gammera to get to a place where he can put him on a rocket and shoot into space. As usual, the monster is foolish and uncoordinated (a man wearing a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to solve the national debt, and of course does not help. They should know this anyway. We've seen a lot of monsters scramble for Tokyo. You should not get rid of these things because they may be fun, but they really are not very good.
