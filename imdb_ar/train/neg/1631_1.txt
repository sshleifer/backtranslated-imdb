PLEASE IF I SAY IF YOU SAY, FOR A MINUTE WHEN I READ YOU THE BACK OF ALLY CAT VHS. He says: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city, each street is a dead end - in every corner something to buy - every alley another way to die - to survive should be better - just like a cat's alley. Cat's alley - this lady owns the night. In the streets where even predators become victims, you know how to survive, pass them through and run out of luck. Alley Cat - This animal is teased. <br /> <br /> Is not this one of the most pathetic disparities I have ever heard in your life? Those who wrote this should be crazy if they thought such a terrible description might tempt us to watch the video. But unfortunately, whatever the anonymous person responsible for this tragic use of English was doing his job very well .. The film contained in a small plastic box as bad as it seems, then some. <br /> <br /> Karen Manny plays the role of the title, and the script tells her mainly during each particular scene, either a) frowning like a goldfish b) kicking a male butt or c) showing her female "qualities". There are no complaints about the latter, but with regard to the other two .. Let's just say that she is not represented, but less convincing as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with the body of Cynthia Rothrock (What a Scary Thought) will fail to save this film. The plot is boring as far as belief is concerned, where we get an inefficiently directed sequence of fighting after a long period of time, suspended only by the courtroom riots and the emotional scene that spurs the show's loopholes with the interesting Robert Turtty. The camera's work also follows a similar path of shame, with many unnecessary closeers and continuity errors. <br /> <br /> The part I think really sums up this little butter of the film is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and she finds herself facing a corrupt judge while being raped by the rapist who is rich from the box. Not only is he silent despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is imprisoned on charges of daring to protest against the verdict in front of his honor. Behind the bars, she got a collective shower, a lesbian crush, two cat fights, and a nice volleyball game before she was released on bail to continue her fight. This 10-minute segment has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the script's display stops. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add more T & A to the mix, and reached this unnecessary sub-plot as a means to that end. <br /> <br /> What kind of question arises, is this a serious drama exploit? My response to this is not a nightmare or a camp enough to attract Troma-inspired film fans, and it certainly does not make the classroom an exploration of a woman's battle against the regime ... just because it's made so horribly. So who on earth wants to see it? Lunatics, I think .. or IMDb reviewers who stay up until 3 pm and watch any old trash on the box while trying to sleep. Unfortunately at this time, failed, horror will stay with me for some time. Do not commit the same mistake you made. Eat hot milk or anything .. 1/10
