If you like "Blair B", you'll love this. He has the same poor work of camera and soundtrack, and he has the same plot as nonexistent and impressive moments. <br /> <br /> It also contains Tom Savigny, so if you love Romeno "Dawn of the Dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk to Dawn" you are in for a treat. It is a symbol and a very good actor as well. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the most wonderful film I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a good number of movies - bad movies too. I can tell you that I find most horror movies in some ways fun, but that was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I paid to make this movie 2 instead of 1, was the bare chicks and the hot motion with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... no, I was just kidding. I must have missed it before pressing "Send" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, although there are sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
