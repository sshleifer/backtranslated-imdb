Where do they get money to make movies like this? I mean, there's nothing to recover about this movie. Does not know any of the actors, the writing is terrible, hazy photography, the story wandering around to be a bad version of Ribo Man and West Nickelodeon and representation is incredible. For someone watching all kinds of movies, good and bad, I must admit that this film is about the worst I've seen since the "eye attack" of the 1950s. I do not really like to waste the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, God forbid, but this movie does not seem to attract anyone. The story is based on a mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of Celtic Soul, though it works like a male cell without any sexual connotations. The bad guys have to cooperate with good people in a town they can not escape. Take it from there because that, alas, is the best part. My advice is that unless you are in bad legends, amateur writing, unconvincing acting and boring settings, you will be offered the best by leaving this option on the shelf when you rent videos.
