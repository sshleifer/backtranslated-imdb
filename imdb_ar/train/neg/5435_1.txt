... bothered making this film? anyone? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a new movie, rent a Summer of '42. This is not the summer of 42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars Nolte & Sarsgaard, Sarsgaard gets more screen time, this is your first warning sign, and, of course, for "arty", there are lots of insults and whips around , Just to make it look "artistic". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard had his usual unattractive character, interspersed with moments that were supposed to be intense. Intensity is the density of a person with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is famous for her appearance and what she should have said about the city of Pittsburgh after this film. Pittsburgh must bear a grudge against it. I filed a petition against a citizen of Pittsburgh. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard an opportunity to get his money in a cartoon style. Wonderful! Was this his first post-high school graduation? <br /> <br /> So, we have a strange triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed and will not take his boss to bed. So, he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller, watches them and keeps it up. <br /> <br /> And then, after one of Sarsgaard's sinister moments, Foster & Miller began to watch him, a "treat" scene. In every detail, sloppy groans. Finally, just to include it fully, get Foster & Sarsgaard, with Foster's role in Miller. Now I know how the players understand (as if this was anything you needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all, all that remains is the tragic end of one character and the remaining retroactive views 2. Gets me right in my stomach hole. Ah wait! That was a pepperoni pizza that I just own. <br /> <br /> I would like to backtrack on the time this film took in my life, please.
