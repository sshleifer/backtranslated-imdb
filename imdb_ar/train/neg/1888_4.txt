This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another film of art is a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the film, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just a special film. Also remind me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a group of low-level inhabitants of a camp in the sea is located in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their will and with all the faces of characters that do not match each other. I also thought about the books written by the French writer Emile Zola who was a naturalist. I did not like the film and I do not like the people in it. They all look very vulgar, without any good basic taste. One may ask the question of why they live, and they all seem to be on the planet as a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: hell on this world.
