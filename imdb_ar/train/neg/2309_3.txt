I have a great deal of tolerance for this strange game, but frankly, some films go further, they cause your brain to hurt. This is such a film. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible, and I think the best way to understand the film during drug use - it is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with some nice Japanese animations that include a cat. However, a lot of twisted and annoying things happen sometimes - which makes me wonder if I'm missing something in the translation. However, even if so, why do we need to deal with images of a magic trick involving cleverly slicing a lady, defecating, restricting, lighting animals on fire, and so on. All this seems really random and fast. Strangely, I do not know why, some see this as a genius. I just do not understand it.
