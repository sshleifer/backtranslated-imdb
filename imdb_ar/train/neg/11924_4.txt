RUN ... Do not walk away from this movie !!!!! Designed to very young children, this movie will carry you tears. If the Gamera trio in the 1990s had lifted the tape, that movie had just cut it. It is a slow pace and good brutal fighting, but rarely seen. This movie made me dry up in the cat box. Just a very bad show after a huge series of nineties. <br /> <br /> The saboteurs are behind this point !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top ten reasons you will admire the Gamera fans in the 1990s series of this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows a child trying to overcome his mother's death and fears losing his baby in a fight after his father learned that the young man is dead. <br /> <br /> 9. You see the Gamera adults probably for a minute at the beginning of the movie. He gets butt his kick by some Gyaos and self destruct ?? It seems old and lethargic. Plus it does not look like any games I've ever seen. He looked cheap and rushed. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see during the rest of the movie looks like a Pokemon. Great eyes and nice ... will remind you of the kid Godzilla of Godzilla and MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera has become very nice now. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie features a NASCAR race speed during rain delay for 3 hours. I watched this movie with two other Gamera fans, and no one was happy with how fast this movie was moving. I saw a SUV full of obese people climbing a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this film had very little time on the screen. The final wars fought more, in fact, better battles even though they were short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the title role. The friend of all the children and their bad writings killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s, and the same history repeated in 2000. The more successful Gamera movies abandoned Sesame Street feeling and went to a darker place. Why return to a failed formula? This was supposed to be a new trilogy and weak ticket sales kill any hope of continuing this story (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his creative roar. He now looks like a laryngeal sponsor. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie may result in a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a staged race involving sending young children into harm's way. You have to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yeah ... Well there send their children to the Kaegu battle area. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but substandard to the Gamera movie. Legion and iris had better effects. The best effect was the appearance of an apple-sized Gamera child. Not very impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This film is not just what the fans of Kaigo expect. The director took part in Power Rangers and shows it. It runs like an intersection between ET, and Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Glory if you know all the references 3. <br /> <br /> You can lease at best or watch once if you buy to complete the DVD series.
