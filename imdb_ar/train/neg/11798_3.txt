I watched Fat Beach on the cable for a while and I enjoyed it. The chubby guy is the best character, because he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just different stereotypes of young black men and women. I like watching these low-budget films that take a while because they resemble a documentary film about the positions of the year and the heresies. Phat Beach is also funny because low budget children in this movie are just house girls. Most low-budget films enjoy the quality of "local babes" and you can say that the children in this film are local exhibitors and JC Penneys underwear models. Some of them had a lot of cellulite hanging from their bikinis, and it was funny to see how the "young" became savagery while they were basically high-mileage ribs. There were some very cuties. This is the magic of these low budget CRIBE films. You'll see lots of dogs, and some real cuties! I have checked some of them at IMDb and after seven years Phat Beach is the only credit. so sad. It would be interesting to have someone make a book entitled "Where are they now" on all the cuties that have appeared in the history of the films and then no longer again. what happened?? There are probably about one or two young men in almost every film who seem to do a lot for them, but years later when you watch the movie again on TV, you wonder, "What happened to X?" In any case, this film is often blown, but it has some funny moments.
