Probably the worst Bollywood movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is no plot line. Very few personal developments. <br /> <br /> Filled with silly and useless humor. The whole film was chaotic and less of a trend. There was no appropriate end to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The same story has been chewed repeatedly until you want to say "Please, just follow it !!" Even the song and dance were meaningless and poorly designed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot audio clips everywhere ... but then most of the Bollywood movies have these days anyway. <br /> <br /> BTW, I'm not an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
