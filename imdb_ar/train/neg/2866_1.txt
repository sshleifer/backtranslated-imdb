No words can describe my absolute charisma for this appalling delivery of a BTK killer. This film rated one out of every 10 compliments with this disastrous excuse for the film. From start to finish, there was no single distinction. Everything was terribly placed. Scenario, representation, plot, lighting, direction, representation, factual information, acting, to name a few. There are a number of funny loud loud scenes, for the awful way in which everything is grouped together. This review may sound like a rude and rude attack on a low-budget movie, but that's not the case. Just thinking about the movie that I just saw makes my blood boil. How this film was granted rights of production I will never know. I am almost tempted to recommend BTK, because it truly represents a privileged place in terms of how pathetic and outrageous it is. I can honestly say, this is the worst in all my years in cinema. Movie. Start. I spent more than an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and I would gladly have stayed in the nearest building in advance, had I known what I was. Zero of ten.
