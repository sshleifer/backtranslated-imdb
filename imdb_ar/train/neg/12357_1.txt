I'll be short and to the point. This film was an insult to anyone with room temperature. Sorry liberals, feminists, and so on. There will be no woman seal. They can forget the draft or fight. will not happen. As you see, difficult to understand or accept, men and women differ physically. Regardless of the fact that in 2007, reality can not change things in order to avoid people hurting their feelings. Men can not give birth or breastfeed children (I forgot "San Franco"). <br /> <br /> Women lack physical strength to be on par with men in combat or other physically difficult situations. How many women are playing in the NFL or American Football League? Finally, I could not give a bloody hustle in hell if what you just wrote bothers you. Come to think about it - if this bothers you, it warms my heart more. I did not write one thing was not the truth. This polite film is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy film in it.
