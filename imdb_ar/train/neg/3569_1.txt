Wonderful! Only this ironically shocking film can inspire similar "girls of the parade." I mean where to start? The song is an unspeakably terrible subject? Pia Zadora non-expressions throughout the film? The fact that, despite being confined in Los Angeles, also known as the "couch couch", every man (and woman!) Prepares himself to sleep with Pia Zadura, by any necessary means necessary? Or what about the fact that everyone in the film is not entirely sympathetic because they are either stupid (Pia) or a really clear Slavic ball (anyone else)? Given that this click was written by the actual "scripta", it shows a sudden lack of understanding of the filmmaking industry (who does hell like and is accepted by one of the editors?) <br /> <br /> But it is funny (unintentionally) Although hell. The scene of "collapse" alone will make you laugh, and after seeing the climate "I'm not the only one who has to **** her way to the top" in the "Awards" (all this is at the standard level of representation in the basement we expect from high quality Pia), and I sincerely hope that dear Pia will reuse this speech when she "won" the Golden Globe Award. Make a day for me. <br /> <br /> In any event, if you are a fan of a bad camp, try this exciting movie.
