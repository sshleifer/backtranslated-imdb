The film itself is pathetic. Deaf people were portrayed as cynical about hearing people. It is true that some deaf people are worried about dating to hear people, but they are not necessarily as angry as Marley Matlin's character throughout the story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance like Mattlin did. All in all, the film itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I would like to believe it's a movie for insomnia. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply hear "children from God less" and watch them. It will put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a deaf person who speaks.
