There are some qualities that replace this offer. One is that the theme tune has a decent melody. The offer has a nice premise. Also, I'm probably in the minority, but I love Wanda. I love the fact that she is caring, and more personal mother to Timmy. However, despite all of this, I do not like this show, it is not feces but I find it very troublesome. <br /> <br /> I will not say it's the best animation program on the planet. When I use this term for a TV show, I think of Peter Pan and the pirates, I'm thinking of Darkwing Duck, I'm thinking of Scooby Doo and I'm thinking of Talespin. I hope I am not the only one who really loves Wild Thornberrys and dislikes the fact that he enjoys it. I do not think the single parents to some extent is the worst moving display on the planet. I agree that it is annoying and has been overestimated in some respects, but it is not the worst bid on Nicolodian. This is the chalk area, which God shows insurmountable. But the worst animation I've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get an idea, an awful, unfair and frankly stark cartoon. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I do not like about this show. animation. Characters, forgive me if I feel insulted, have very strange features to the face, a lot of backgrounds are faint and lack the color that makes Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys very nice to look at. The characters except Wanda I find very annoying. I can not believe such a talented vocal actress like Tara Strong (also known as .Carendoff) expressed Timmy. Timmy I do not find a very popular person as a leader at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronizing, and a bad decision maker too. His voice strikes my nerves. I actually love the strong but not in the show. Another annoying figure is Cosmo, the supposed personal is funny. Instead, his jokes are not as crazy as they may become. They are either a) contrived, or b) familiar. Timmy's parents are horrible characters, who do not care about their son, and their personalities wear well. <br /> <br /> Story lines are not very original for the most part, and I keep thinking about it, where I've seen this before. The episodes were after the arrival of the child which I thought was inaccessible. Even worse is that scripts, too unfamiliar, boys, and few, suffer from a complete lack of energy. <br /> <br /> All in all, not the worst show at all, but very poor for the animator and somewhat uncomfortable to sit through. 3 / 10- There are replacement qualities, I fully understand whether people like it.
