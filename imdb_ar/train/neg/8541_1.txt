Welcome to Movie 17 on the classic 50 pack. Where we will see, this is true. Another film makes no sense at all. Seriously, this film was in my confusion at the end, I thought I was watching the movie "At Dawn When They Were Sleeping". The plot looks simple enough .... well, until 3 seconds in the movie where the girl is supposed to have killed a cat then ... Umm .. exploded? I have no idea what happened. That was before the screen title. It's really sad when I can not even figure out what happened in the first three minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case, he is starring with a big mustache who finds this girl after throwing his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere. So we got there but not before someone stole his own jeep to drive 200 feet from the road towards the city. suspicious? Nah. So they decided to stay in this abandoned village with an old lady. Then blah blah blah blah blah blah talk. The man with the mustache comes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to. He lost his way and then found his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that all this after 20 minutes is worthless of them staying in a man's house resembling that of a man who looked like a stroller from Casablanca. Then they leave. There is really no point in this scene. It's really just a charge. If you cut it, no one will notice or care about it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that was actually the best part of the film. wait. Let me rephrase that. Unfortunately this was really the best part of the film. Because the rest was so confused that I had to look for IMDb to see what had happened. But of course no one knows that I SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film were some of the most startling moments I saw in the film. They wore a dress, then they were kidnapped, then released, returned home, and finally the witches were at home and finished? seriously. I was not confused in the film. I mean, movies like "War of the Robots" are bad, at least they make sense. This film does not make it an attempt to be coherent. The end was confusing like the end of "When Dawn Sleeps" and the plot was more boring. This movie gets only 1 because "I have no idea what happened in this film." "Witches mountain" gets a confused movie monitor out of 10.
