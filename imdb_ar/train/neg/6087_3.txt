This film was not just a routine work as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this rather mysterious conspiracy plot UFO paranoia. Most representation is modest, but fairly typical for 1970s-style things filled with pregnant pause. A photographer and model saw some strange events in the forest and soon fell victim to these same events. The flying saucers are monitored, and more people disappear - but is it foreigners or our government's highly secretive group of men covering up? Soon after, a reporter and a "UFOologist" (apparently the character of the writer and director) are drawn to this failed failure and become the target of superiors who are as threatened as they are improbable and unfaithful. Then start really fun. <br /> <br /> The film, as expected, is just as logical as the UFO plot theory, but it should be praised for taking it seriously. The camera works fine for the low-budget movie. The speed is good, the scenario is ridiculous and ridiculous, and there are continuity issues that can be searched for. What are the few seconds of brilliance you mentioned? Frankly, I can not tell you much without spoiling the spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the film, at least, deserves quick re-orientation if you can not take the medium.
