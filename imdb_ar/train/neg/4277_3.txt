Veteran director and producer Alan Duan, whose huge series of films have been completely oblivious and frequent (for example, John Wayne in "Iwo Jima Sands") tried his hand at a big concert with "I Dream With Jenny." Harnessing a wonderful group of very few experienced singers in past films, and as it turns out that there is almost no future, he has made a fictional story and did not attack her much about the great American songwriter Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is a young, lovable young man who has the kindness of slaves to give the saved money to the engagement ring to pay the hospital for a wounded young black boy. His goal is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) who realizes her annoying little sister, Jenny (Eileen Christie) slowly that she is in love with Smith's impeccable song. Foster is in love with Ennis who was rebelled by composer No. 1 on the song Luffy Hit Barred, "O Susanna". Edwin P. Christie (Ray Middleton) introduced the publication to help kick-start the profit-taking phase of Foster's life. <br /> <br /> This is according to the standards of musical films in the early 1950s, which is a great production. Luxury collections in that Hollywood-style fashion that were filmed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not too bad, and it is almost impossible to destroy Foster's songs. <br /> <br /> But this is also a fading craftsman in the south of antebellum. Featuring the largest number of black facade for all on stage, historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of racism that you do not think. If these images were black anywhere near reality, the abolition of the penalty would be condemned for their involvement in a very useful institution. <br /> <br /> It seems that "I dream of Jenny" sank into the basement of the studio and barely whispered death. It has now been revived by Alpha video for only $ 4.99, a period piece with enchanting and emotional songs disgusting by the victims of major American crime and slavery. <br /> <br /> This is what Hollywood was exposed to two years ago against Brown. Education Council. The hearts of some moviegoers who wore their bedclothes must have improved to the stage.
