Horrible movie. It is a shame that some actors and actresses in Flanders have made a very sad film unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Almost nothing has changed since the first film and the TV series: same actors, same model characters and the same scenario (emotional complications, the team under emotional pressure but everything turns to the top after a major predictable end). There is another constant fact in the work of Jan Verheyen and the subject of the product exaggerated (the company logo on the team shirt and the side of the stadium beside the OK but twice advertising (by one of the characters) about the Internet provider is slightly higher. Himself, there are rumors about making a second series for Vlanders' commercial TV station 'VTM' (coincidentally or not, the station where Jan Verheyen has been the manager for a few months) <br /> In conclusion ... the berry award Golden for the worst foreign film goes to ... Team Spirit 2
