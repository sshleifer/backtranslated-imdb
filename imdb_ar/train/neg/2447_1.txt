After watching KHAKEE, I felt that I would watch another good film but unfortunately, the film is a joke and actually tries to make Ariman Aftral his father Kisho is the producer <br /> <br /> RKS spoke strongly about the film during the promotions, considering that the film contains meat unlike movies Which was released at the time, I wonder about the movies he was talking about. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a typical Masala movie with lots of comedy, romance and motion. /> <br /> The ease with which the children kidnap the family, is one of the most extreme parts of all, Imagine children abducting the family of David <br /> <br /> The end is a complete murmur with a sudden change in characterization < br /> RKS offers his weakest film yet, with the exception of some Bachchan scenes that the movie is a cavity <br /> <br /> Boring music <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to give his role all he does is his role well, though That he does not do his best even though he deforms his face a lot when pulling the trigger and take a strange look while smoking cigars H The dubbing is also inappropriate sometimes <br /> <br /> Akshay exists for a few minutes and repeats Serfath and Ihams <br /> <br /> seems to be Oriman without expression, strongly tries to overcome some of the scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika appear in the best in <br /> <br /> The rest is just fine
