Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love cinema, so I have to watch these dirty movies in the theaters. I was hoping that the Vanilla Sky would be good. I hoped they would either "open your eyes" exactly as they were, or make them their own. Well, it has happened a bit both and has been absorbed. <br /> <br /> He looked good. I love Radiohead. I wish there were more. But in the end we listen to the good vibrations from The Beach Boys. We talk about a wide range of sucks between. They had one or two good songs at the club and probably a couple of others, but why oh why they had to shed light on the GV during the peak. It was more annoying than confusing or stark. Especially when he has nothing to do. At least put some meanings behind the songs. Kid = Primary. whatever. <br /> <br /> He also did a great job in the club scene. That was great. Otherwise the film would be a big ball of arrogance. As if the fans would get the movie. Those that will get read translations, and the rest do not. It's that easy. The motives got all screwed up. I did not understand Diaz's motives (did they not do chicken soup the night before?) And some others. I hate Kurt Russell. Stay at sea. Tom Cruise can not work (especially in these types of movies [ie Wide Wide Shutter]). The elevator. Understand it. However, they tried to improve the original with rocky American rock music, chrysanthemums, good film printing and glossy processing, and this could have helped if the audience had not proved it. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Very disappointed.
