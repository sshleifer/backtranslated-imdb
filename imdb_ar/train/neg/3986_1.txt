When I refer to Malice as a Noir movie, I do not like such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon. Becker does not compare Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Louis Bonwell. I just record in protest against the darkness that reigns in this film from start to finish, so much so that most of the time you simply can not make what is going on. I can understand darkness in the night scenes but this film was dark even in broad daylight, for some reason I lost it. Still, it would have made a big difference if director Baker had shot him in total darkness.
