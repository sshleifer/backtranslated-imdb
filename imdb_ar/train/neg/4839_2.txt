... being ever let down. I will not mention any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic. If you are a military trainer, do not worry about watching. I put it on a DVD with two friends who want to watch a somewhat interesting war / excitement bout. Why I was not able to read reviews first. <br /> <br /> In the first scene of the bomb, the film has huge flaws, and continues to grow larger and larger. My friends, who are not associated with the army in any way, discovered some of the mistakes of the director at the same speed as myself and asked me if things were going on. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not - at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you are able to overlook these absolutely stupid mistakes and mistakes that occur. 2/10 to catch my attention at first.
