First of all, I would just like to tell everyone who saw this film that the actor who played the role of the "transsexual" is one of my friends, Robert Dugdell. He is a wonderful actor, although he does not say much about his film. He was in many plays and musicals. Currently residing on the Terrace PC. This is where I came from, and comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Well, now about the film, I would not recommend this to anyone who did not see it, because it's not a movie to watch, the main reason I found it a bad film is that it never stayed at His place, however, continues to recede between time, so it is difficult to follow him on some points, and second, his laugh * really boring * the film just does not compare.
