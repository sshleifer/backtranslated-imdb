Again (again) in Scotland, Lacy will be tried again for her life. Since the insured dog sleeps on the grave of her master, she must be killed, according to the law. Curiously, it is also explained that Lacey has no "legal" owner, which apparently violates the old Scottish law. In the absence of an owner after three days, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwynne (like John Trail) pleads with Lacy, leading to a long return back, and Lacy's adoption of Donald Cresp (in the name of John "Jook" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on an interesting and innovative story ("Grayfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" reviews many of the former Lassie positions; it does not improve on them. By comparison, this one is dirty and uninspiring. It is a disappointing follow-up to The Sun Comes Up (1949). Geraldine Brooks may be a witch (like Susan Brown) and many other artists, but they can not lift this performance. Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is one of the prominent children who support Lacey; much later, he will grow up marrying the "Dark Shadows" "Angelique Magic" (Lara Parker).
