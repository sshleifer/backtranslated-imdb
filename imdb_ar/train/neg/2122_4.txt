Although the Seven Pounds in some aspects are solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, the Gabriele Muccino project is fairly average. The film becomes happier and more playful as it moves towards the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and figurative eyes. Seven Pounds is more than an amateur tradition for Amores Perros for Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of memories of the past. The problem is that the story is quite predictable from VERY easily through the film. This is very bad, because Seven Pounds would have been "good" if Ben and Emily had been placed in the right hand.
