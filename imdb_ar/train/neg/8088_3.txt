To shoot a good movie, you need excellent actors or an excellent way out. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Need game we have nothing. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. You do not have to have done much in his career. I like Donald Sutherland very much, but he can not be the main actor in the film. It's short. Sutherland is excellent in film when it shows for more than 15 minutes. I would say for example that Sutherland was excellent at JFK for Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on a garden bench for 10 minutes nonstop without taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland's main actor in a film is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nilligan? It's probably good for the TV series. Awesome DVD. Awesome colors. The light is terrible. I did not even appreciate the sight of Storm Island over the magnificence of photography. <br /> <br /> Ken Follett's story was good, but unfortunately it turned it into an unimportant movie.
