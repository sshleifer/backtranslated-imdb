I have to bet at the back to watch this movie all the time because it was really painful. Painter cant become a fully capable hit man? This film was full of junkies, and if I told them all, I would give it. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must be really on his way to approving this film. The acting was pitiful and the story was worse. As a rational and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this film. There was incompetence by every major character, there was a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, and then the film ended. The ridiculous behavior between two people after another with dialogue does not make a film, it only leads to the destruction of a train talkative.
