I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I have to warn potential viewers that this is a very bad film. Just awful. I love Shaw Bros. (I'm not hateful.) And I had great expectations for this one because I found it included in many of the "Top 10 Kung Fu / Martial Arts" sites. (I'm now convinced that these top 10 lists are all cutting and pasting functions.) First of all, there is hardly any action in the film. Most of the film consists of talking about the chart, which is a wonderful achievement because it is thin at best. The procedure itself may have been impressive in 1978, but it is a routine according to today's standards. Special warning for Netflix users: The DVD they are shipping is terrible; the picture is horrible and not optimized until 16: 9.
