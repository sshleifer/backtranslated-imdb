I have always been amazed by the original atmosphere of Dante (1981) ?? So I was not particularly interested in verifying any of its consequences; some time ago, I caught HOWLING III: Monopolies (1987)? The same director like this? I found it viewable but there was nothing special. <br /> <br /> But the second batch, however, had a bad delegate and I knew I had a good time watching it? If the main reason for dumping him in the minds of the icon of the horror of the cherished but eternal Christopher Lee in the middle of it all (the old star gracefully pathetic several times confirmed in interviews that he did not appear in a taxi directed to horror since his film) Hammer Films dating back to 1976!). Anyway, this movie should have been subtitled "your film faeces" ?? Be amazingly incompetent in all sections (starting with the most important wolf make-up)! <br /> <br /> The plot (and dialogue) is not just awful, but has a weak connection with Dante's film? Strangely, the author of the original novel Gary Brandner co-wrote this himself! Still, one of the undeniable highlights (er ... low points) of the film is an oval editing useless? Who tries to give the appearance of the whole fashion, but he only works to highlight his embarrassment factor! In the same vein (and tangled) are the shifts between the scenes and rock rock punk song, cheap cheap effects at its peak! <br /> <br /> What about the characters, then?: Lee is a wolf expert, of course, which everyone thinks? In order to get into contact with monsters, at least, however, one must admire the ingenuity of manufacturers (or bitterness) in creating a stupid double meaning! By the way, Sibyl Daning (like Stirba, Werewolf Bitch? Subtitle known as this in the UK!) Brings a variety of horrible S & M clothes ... but her character gives almost nothing (except the presidency of her followers and engaging in the Larnethian race) Sometimes a funny trio!); Two of her aides (one of them a sterile black girl) are particularly troublesome. <br /> <br /> Helping me on the side of good are the heroes of Yubi (being the brother of De Wallace's character from the first film she is a colleague) and her band-type guerrilla transylvians (still, they generally managed to overcome the efforts of the Daning Wolves Pretty stupid!). The most prominent of them is a dwarf who throws the knife and injures him wicked (but, at the same time, side by side); he was later revived, under the control of Stirba, in order to attract me (by making fun of the children throughout the village streets) into a trap. Must be the last scene rarely professionally for the distinguished and the representative ?? Well, either this or early sequencing in the disco where Lee was designed to use a pair of very brilliant sunglasses to look indistinct between young parties! <br /> <br /> In the end, if I have to mention elements in this matter that were not entirely disturbing, I think I can say that the group of greats (where the sacrifice is sacrificed) is interesting, or that the creature of a wolf / A creature hybrid (a pet from Danning loves to inhabit "the body of its victims) is so strange that it can not be disturbed ...
