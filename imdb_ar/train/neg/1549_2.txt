While Lyon is nice on the SNL, it works for only one minute. Like most SNL skits to movies, this can not be filled in one 90 minutes. It has some nice moments (the ones I've seen in the trailer) but the actors are pretty much wasted. Tim Meadows does his best but the plot does not contain many points of interest. Will Farrell has a little bit. Farrell may be the most alive man alive ... but not in this film. what a shame.
