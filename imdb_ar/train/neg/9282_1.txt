This film does not deserve the title of Omen. It is very bad that it has already damaged the classical nature of the first three. It was not supposed to have been made, they must change the title. <br /> <br /> So they do not spell the name Damien Thorne properly !!! There is no daggers, the most important element in all Omen films. Pull it out of the shelves and burn it.
