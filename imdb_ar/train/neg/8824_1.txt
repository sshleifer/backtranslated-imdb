What can be said about this film other than "Beware of the viewer". Christmas villain must come with a warning sticker like a cigarette, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely am not satisfied with the flick about "B" horror, but this film could not even be afraid of a little five year old. The goal of a crazy man who has a relentless thirst for blood in a film is that he must seem like God, because there is nothing to stop their frenzied fury, but in this film, the mentally ill residing in a smoker stumbles on the strange attempt to surprise his next victim, Following the folk legend of Santa Claus is a reminder to the viewer that this man is by no means dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all a complete waste of the film.
