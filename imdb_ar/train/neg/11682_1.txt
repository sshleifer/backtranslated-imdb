If someone could tell me why they were digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell was known as Rebbe and how they knew on earth that diamonds were in a certain cell, that would only be done everyday, but it seems that Spike is asking us to We take a lot of things in this matter as a foregone conclusion, and do not raise our fat when it seems stupid ... It's just a film holding another studio that is relaxing and enjoying ...
