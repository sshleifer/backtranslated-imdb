I once thought that Stone Age was the worst film ever ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" have overtaken him in every way I can imagine and I could not. In the "Stone Age" people hated. In "Hobgoblins" the actors hated ... and everyone involved in creating this atrocity. I will not include a teaser for this film, I'm not cruel. I could not subject innocent people to yourselves for such torment. In fact, any discussion about the plot related to this film is meaningless and humiliating. The words I will use to describe this film are as follows: Poor, Inactive, and Innovative. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, please do not watch this movie. I beg you, from one film lover to another ... No, from one person to another, please. For your mind and your mind do not see it. Destroy any copies you encounter.
