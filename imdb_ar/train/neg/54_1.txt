The only good thing about this film is the portrayal of Goldy Hawn, standing in her small bikini shorts slung in French, struggling to keep dozens of other poor women from removing her tight little cotton hat while laughing and cheering. Ooooof! Her rivals compete with Nina Hartley. This film came out when I was fourteen, and this picture has killed me. I had forgotten everything in the rogue Roladex movie in my mind until I saw him the other day on television, where they actually stretched out her body in this scene, their sadness, reminding me of smoking from a woman named Goldy Hawn in the eighties. Kurt Ross must have enjoyed an enjoyable life.
