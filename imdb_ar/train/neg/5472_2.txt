Throughout the day, I was watching the dinosaurs, and I was faced all day with the same basic problem. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in firearms. They did not seem to be talking about them or about anything. Lead _bounce_ off the dinosaurs! Perhaps that is because they were extinct millions of years ago from the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were quite different at the time .... Come on. If they are close enough to chemical work today, they will have to be vulnerable to rapid (even supersonic) missiles. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> See, the most powerful reptiles on the planet today, crocodiles and crocodiles, are completely exposed to the fire of basic guns. They're nothing magic. You can shoot the round revolver right through the heavy gauges on their backs. Do not take armor piercing or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they do not kill them. The fairly large bullets (not already) are preferred because the challenge (as with most games) is to kill the animal with a shot, so it does not work. (Fishermen consider it immoral to let the prey escape and die without harvest.) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily shot. Between the noise and the pain of a non-lethal wound, most will escape. The exception is the big bears, who are not afraid to the extent that they are just mortal wounds. The head buffalo is very dangerous because it is known to be shipped on injury. We've seen a video about the big bulls in a herd of buffalo heads saving a calf from the full pride of the black. The big cat will be operated if possible, but if it can not, it will be shipped as a final act of desperation. Where T.Rex fit in this unknown spectrum. Their behavior simply was not noticed. With these large animals, safe hunting becomes the issue of applying a large and appropriately powerful shell, and / or applying many of them quickly enough to meet their load. With T.Rex, of course, this may be a serious problem. I've seen a T.Rex skull (they have one in the downtown museum) and carrying a gun big enough for a bust may be impractical. Chewing his neck with many small fires may be a more viable approach. And the small lead was still penetrating, and will not rebel just because the animal is too big to kill easily! <br /> <br /> If we have here Cortez and his men (this is before the famous Mexican expedition, apparently) captured by Native Americans and destined to sacrifice the pyramid. All of these human sacrifices seem to have been about quelling the thirst for T.Rexes, who terrorized the continent today. Instead of just cutting their hearts and feeding them to the deserters, Cortez et al-Aztec talks about allowing them to fish and kill them. Well, they probably did not have M-16 like men in the "Carnosaur" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made of trees) and swords. This may be less different from the full-car teams, but they have many players and quickly bet on a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's _cannon_, 4 inches in size. This is just a ticket to break the skull of a dinosaur! So they put a trap, with a group of men, cannon, pointed sticks in the valley, and attract the first T.Rex in it, using a girl's beautiful structure as bait. Cortez says they will not have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range to be sure of their goal. T.Rex completely ignores the shot flintlock fire, and see both the bow nail _ bounce ball - kicks off! forget that. End of credibility. The cross of the bow will be defeated on the shield of the Cortis trunk, and a cannonball 4 may penetrate the body of a wooden ship, which would surely hide or soften the chest or skull of any animal walking on this planet. Trix, still standing, does not even bleed. So Curtiz attracts her to the valley, where he falls on the pointed sticks, which she pierces (I think is magical) and kills her. Yahei, pointed sticks! <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs are not completely exposed to fire - they succeed in extinguishing the second eye with a gun. This turns it off, so it does not mean a bear or buffalo, at least in movies. <br /> <br /> They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made of pumpkins filled with gunpowder and precious stones. My money is still on the cannon. The engineering function is to concentrate all the powder energy in one direction - towards the target. The bomb is a more widespread application of force. A _real_ bomb (not a percussion bomb) contains a steel shell containing the blast for extremely high pressure. (Think: pipe bomb vs. fireworks.) A stack of gunpowder that will be burned will simply go to the POOF. (Believe me.)
