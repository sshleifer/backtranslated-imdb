My first full histone movie. The film everyone already knows. "Sci-Fi". The campy factor. Everything that fits in the film was pumped into my head when I hired it, and the morning I saw it was the perfect film to watch in the mood I was in. (I do not want to move, put a player, hide in the blankets). Although I tried to understand what was happening to lead to the end that pop culture would destroy forever, it did not really work. Everything was everywhere, relations had no spine, and the result had no progress. Everything was there somehow horribly, and the observer had no choice but to leave a bit tired at the end of it, because even though we all know he is a person, it is quick answers to why people made any serious attempt to enjoy the film for anything else The naive that is thrown out of the window.
