This is just bad bad. Sometimes, even if you move away from the original, the restructuring processes are good on their own. They can provide a different perspective and achieve a particular interpretation that makes them unique and fun. This was a bad thought and implemented as it could be. This was not any good until he stood on himself. Viggo Mortenson is a top notch actor, but some of his choices of roles and projects leave something to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was an exciting psychological adventure. This is not an adventure at all, nor is it fun or entertaining at all. This was done through an elaborate film-making approach, where the plot points that someone in Hollywood thinks would satisfy the audience of today's cinema. Basically, they see us as a group of idiots. It is humiliating for someone to put this film as a feature film, and even to try to recreate a classical cult is slow. The manipulative plotting, facets "make it clear, so do not miss it", an ironic dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur direction ... <br /> <br /> This is bad bad ....
