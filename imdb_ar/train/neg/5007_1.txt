There is no reason to see this film. Good idea is treated very bad plot. In the middle of the film, everything changes and from there nothing is logical. The cause of the murder was not explained. The representation is appalling. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better manager. It was excellent in the bedroom, but it was horrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, she has to change her character someday. Even those who enjoy sex and gratuitous violence will be disappointed. Although the movie was 80 minutes long, it is too short for the good movie (but it is too long for this film), but there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means it did not bother to fill in the missing parts. /> <br /> Do not spend time in this.
