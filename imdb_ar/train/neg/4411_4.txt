Michael Rucker is a respectable actor, but he has no work being the lead only in a low-budget film. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has more than just a screen, and unfortunately it's not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the Rooker facing a tile. <br /> <br /> Daniel Harris (from Halloween 4 & 5) plays her daughter's role, which is nice and entertaining but written as not too smart and one of her stupid mistakes gets one of the main characters she killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwaite, and Stephen Forrest are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Chiavelli plays the role of Concegliar of the local mafia godfather, and it is difficult to tell whether or not he works as a film. Tim Thomerson is also in this film. It seems that in every film very low-moving direct budget. Thomerson is also in some low budget comedy. Seeing a lot of comedians and comedians in this film made him look like a parody. Is it a parody of Yakuza? Difficult to say in some points. There is certainly very little work Yakuza. <br /> <br /> The cast of Thugs and Goons is a threat and casts well. Some of these types of films contain "thugs" who look like they work in a local comic book store or as children in Piggly-Wiggly shares. Overall this film is very uneven. At some points, it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points, it works as a good film. Then flutter to its end. Without the contributions of Daniel Harris and Rio Ishibashi, this film is rated zero in my humble opinion.
