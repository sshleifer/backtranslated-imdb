Calling a film about a lost ghost avenging a dangerous lame and unimportant is very ironic, but here it is an indistinguishable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while still enjoying the spectacle itself, They are so vulgar that they give a chuckle rather than a deliberate chills. However, thanks to the terrible straits in which the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even the average script of this genre was able to attract the names of the ten stars - Clive Robertson (as an immigrant couple), Jean Simmons , As well as Jody Jason (as Simmons), Justin's best friend and wife (Flora Robson), and Jesse Aston (as a non-sister to Robertson), Simon Ward (as a mysterious driver), Ron Moody As housekeeper), and David Tomlinson (as Readmind wills Simmons read), and most exciting of Astonishment, Jack Warner (sculpted sculpture), although most of them actually do not have the parts, I'm sorry to say!
