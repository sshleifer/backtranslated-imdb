At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for future generations. For good reason! The small super-small gray cells (sorry Agatha) left at home for this story. There is no logical conclusion, and there is no sharp analysis of markers at the crime scene. Holmes stumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The treacherous CAM is finally handled by a weak person - in a way that will make Charles Brunson's heart swell by a six-pronged bullet in the bread basket. I decided to talk about the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film. Killer, Holmes and Watson, escape the Scots for free. Well, it's a minor change in the late Victorian era in London. A little law of six guns :-)
