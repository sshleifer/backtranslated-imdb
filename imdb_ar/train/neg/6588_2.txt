Here are some of the most obvious problems in this film: 1) Many cliches. Seriously, there are awful "transformations" everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative moves in time, which will be good if done well, but it is not. Which do not develop much, either remain perfectly constant, or change radically without good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Great one: terrible. At the top of almost everyone. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best points in the movie: 1) The intro is good looking. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who will participate in this film: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes of the trip simply because the index finger is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think for themselves, "I love Hollywood Drake is full of cliches and exaggerated, but only if I can see it in Korean ..." There's a lot of good Korean cinema there, so why Lost your time with garbage?
