This film is just a shame. It seems that Orlando, Florida has become a more famous film industry area (such as the rise of Vancouver to the foreground). The Brothers was filmed in central Florida, and this short film is a setback for the region (which has made great strides with Indie, who walks across Africa and HBO's brilliant Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. She had the ability to give a new spin on the "boy band" madness. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the Brotherhood probably lacks a weak text. Both protagonists are flat without any evolution (part of this may be amateur representatives, but some of them are certainly the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> The problem is to choose jokes. Many jokes are very frequent (they explode funny the first time, but they become a little boring). Some "concert" scenes are poorly displayed (and many of these scenes do not seem to convey the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had great hopes in this scene, but unfortunately a disappointing effort. I also hope it will be the best for the next advantage accordingly. But I think the best thing for director John Vig is to move to different types (quickly). Comedy is not a powerful suit. But there is no doubt that he is certainly one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (shame it is now notorious and not famous). <br /> <br />
