First, let me start this publication by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do not read books, play games, wear underwear or eat cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> With what has been said, I am struggling to see how people give this film praise. Taking this film alone, not comparing it to the terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say it's a great movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the script - the cowardly dialogue, the fabricated scenes (like R2 suddenly becoming a heresy, the long intense chase scenes of CGI having little human touch), terrible acting, and the remarkable plot holes ... How is this good? There was no real internal dilemma within Anken; it seemed as if the key had turned and was suddenly evil. I was not interested in the film until the last 20 minutes or so (and ruined by the scene "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein). When you click on the screen with amazingly cool CGI effects and fill the gaps with a monstrous class when there's a lot to say, this is not a great movie. For the "dark" movie, there was a lot of weight in the speech of all the characters. <br /> <br /> Close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, there was already a sense of urgency and importance of what was about to happen?
