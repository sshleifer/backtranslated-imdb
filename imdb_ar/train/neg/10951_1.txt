I have no idea what idiots gave to this film the Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 because it was horrible! I saw it all because I simply could not believe that someone would make a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about this plot, the characters are shallow and there is no attempt to give any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste two hours of your life watching this movie, make sure to bring something to offer, because the cinema is just a person around it with a portable video camera and half the time you can not even see the main topics. This method has been used more successfully in films such as "Witch Blair" because it creates suspense. In Rachid, there is no plot and no suspense in that this style would lend anything. I should have known better when it came at 2 am that it would be terrible.
