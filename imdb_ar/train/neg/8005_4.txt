Gwoemul (Host) - Due to pollution in the Han River, a mutated monster turns into a frenzy. The youngest of the Park family was abducted by the monster, and it was up to the rest of her family to find her, before she became the last meal of the beast. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: mutant bears, large crocodiles, packs of comodo dragons, the whole group. The creature features are my favorite type of horror movies. So, I really wanted to admire the host, but it was not. <br /> <br /> Three major problems occurred: <br /> <br /> The first problem can be seen by taking a quick look at its IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Many damned species. It took seriously to be a comedy, yet it was very lukewarm and did not have any real message (although he seemed to be trying to make some statements: anti-pollution, anti-US or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in mashed mash jam with all the other styles. <br /> <br /> Second, after the initial brutal attack, almost nothing happened to the entire film. The central family is searching for one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America do nothing. And that's all, they only walk around, sometimes bumping into each other, and assume they have little comfort in the comedy. This lack of work made my attention wander, and it seems that he did the same for the director, where the entire plot was not resolved (the mysterious plague invented by the evil Americans was not entirely forgotten, never resolved). <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is a clumsy politician. It depicts Americans as stupid and evil, but it does not give us American characters deeper than the cartoon villain. The opening scene sees the most blatant American moments on the Korean side. With the assistant Korean morgue asks the boss, forensic doctor, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American forensic doctor is all obsessed with ordering the assistant to continue. In addition to being racist, it is slow film making and there is no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the beast is a good combination of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the animation effects are extremely fascinating, and the initial monster hunt across the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. It is strange that some remind me of the way in which Firefly was filmed (counter-cameras, focus shots, etc.). There is also a beautiful scene in the end, where the hero sits and a small boy has saved him in the family mobile food stall. It is time for night and snow falls, the street lamp gives a cool light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a flick about the decent creature, and instead I get some fake political comedy and horror. Given the comments on the IMDb, I can only think that if this is an American production, it will be scheduled. Just because this foreign flick does not mean it is good. There have been some wonderful films from Korea in recent years (the Vengeance and the Brotherhood, for example), but this is definitely not one. <br /> <br /> One time I support a new edition. Tighter output, improved scripting and this can be a nice film. As it is, not worth a few hours of anyone's time.
