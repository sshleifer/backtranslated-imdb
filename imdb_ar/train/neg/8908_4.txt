This series was the CBS network answering the success of the Grand Canyon. It was 90 minutes west just as it was the ABC program. Although he had an answer, he did not have the things to go beyond the second season. <br /> <br /> The problem has become a reality in this show. For example, in one episode, Johnny put his eyes on a stick. Surprisingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had been fully healed. Besides, the stories about this place were not as close to a force as the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is an offer I do not want to play DVDs on, and I honestly hope they're never released. I think CBS was running out of many, they used many familiar settings. This was one of the latest Western series produced by CBS because the West did not enjoy real popularity in the 1970s.
