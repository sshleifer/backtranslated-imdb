I just came back from a free show and I'm very happy because I did not pay for this substandard film. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. It seemed as though it was only the kids who were laughing at all the annoying and annoying jokes though (god ok they loved beating these poor mice in the crotch too much!). The film is beautiful, non-intelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. It seems that the characters are grouped together to fill the empty space, and it seems that the relations between them all were very compelling without magic at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is about average with nothing really featuring. They did a good job of simulating the clay form of Wallace and Gromit, but otherwise it was very forgotten. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored throughout the entire film, I laughed several times. It is not a failure at all, but I certainly do not want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you do not care to see your kids cheap jokes that are useless) then feel free to take them to see them, but no one else should waste their money.
