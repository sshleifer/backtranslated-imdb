I generally like watching Burt Lancaster movies - especially when you need to get nuts by being on the screen like Elmer Gantry. However, his great power, magnetism, was sometimes his greatest weakness because he seldom underestimated anything. It is this lack of precision that really hinders the rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a kind of writer but how Katharine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. It's supposed to be smart but it does not look so when Blanc Lancaster is thrown on the screen! In addition, the story may be one of the most wonderful films I have ever seen, and it is very clear that this film is based on a play. It seems that it was mostly filmed in a phonetic phase rather than a large wide open west as it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is too exaggerated.
