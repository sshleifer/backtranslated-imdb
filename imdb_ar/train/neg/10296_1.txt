Maybe it was just my DVD --- but I would not recommend that anyone try watching this image on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to raise the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some speech is still inaudible. If you are from Scotland, you will have a chance, albeit slim. <br /> <br /> People's voices have sunk from almost all the sounds around, including canceling the package, steps and even puffing on the cigarette. <br /> <br /> As you raise the volume to a level where you can hear sounds, I can guarantee that one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes to a noisy environment, such as a disco. And you will injure yourself as you dive into the remote control to bring it back down. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But in time of war, this effort will meet international standards for its categorization as horrific. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour, I surrendered, and I did not see anything else retrieved in the picture, either.
