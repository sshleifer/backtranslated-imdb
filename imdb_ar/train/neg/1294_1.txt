The main theme in this film seems to be confusion, where relations, preparation, representation and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his will, lacking in clarity, direction and usual intensity on him. To make matters worse, his character's name is "Chi", and we just told (directly, by the narrator) well in the film that it is not so "Chi", only a man named Chi. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once they are determined, the family - the younger generation - is divided into America. Clichyat discusses other reviews of how the film depicts the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; but the director's political position is at best ambiguous, and we are never sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. So they lost their property (gained from gambling profits) - what's that? Refusing to take a political stand, when making a film about the Cuban revolution, is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the film was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. If it is important to look at family life here, it would be nice to know who - we initially offered them all - a cheap way to get out of the relationship clearly during the film! The acting was often shallow, unbelievable, The references to American films - and the black character as a Greek choir - were totally unjustified, boasted mentally, and misplaced, and I saw the entire film just because I was waiting for clarity, or referring to everything. It never happens.
