The "power run" begins with an interesting but rapidly decreasing. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Outside Bell, "Power Play" has no value or benefit. Power Play has more earthquakes in a few days than California in a year. The scene and the earthquake in the mall are very fabricated and totally implausible. All the scenes of the movement look like a group of third-graders playing a play. It's terrifying, simply terrifying. <br /> <br /> In summary, if Power Play is shown in the 1960s or 1970s, it will be a poor B movie. The fact that Play Play was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there something like a "D" movie? If so, the "power run" casts the mold.
