I saw this movie last weekend and it's ridiculous and reckless. An old curse turns a man into a mummy in a pajamas? The victims are afraid and can not escape from a slow-moving old man. They drop their torches and tremble instead of trying to remove or burn him. Quentin alias. Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster known as Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the representatives follow each other in the cemeteries and wait for the screaming and fleeing reaction to help them. The Egyptian girl is not bad-looking but does not give much to the film. Where is the mummy? Really just a damn curse. This does not carry a torch for at least Universal Mummy movies. Watch this movie if you need to sleep, because you will get a dose.
