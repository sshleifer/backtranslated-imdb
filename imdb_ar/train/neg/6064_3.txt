Well okay okay. As good as John Carpenter's first season in the "Masters of Horror", this is just the opposite. He has certainly proved to be the master of horror with "Cigarette Burns" but "Pro-Life" may be the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> He is stupid and completely free from the creepy and tense atmosphere and is welcome although the time is less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and unattractive, the result is unreasonable. <br /> <br /> For those suckers who have already bought a DVD (someone is me); have you seen how Carpenter describes the movie? He is really proud of him and speaks of him as his best work for a long time, praising the script. In the course of the comments, where Berghia notes clearly and reached the end, he says only that he does not feel it is necessary to correct the error and has left it there. I am afraid that the old master has lost his full touch. I sincerely hope I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and remember that the effects of the creature are wonderful. Technically, this film is first class, with effective lighting schemes and make-up effects.
