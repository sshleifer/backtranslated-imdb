For a good half hour or so, I remember thinking myself: "Hey, this may be the best achievement for Bill Ripen at all!". The opening sequence in the atmosphere, there are immediately some frightening moments to enjoy and our manager even points to his own cricket sting as "Giant Spider Raiders" in a fun way. The concept was shamelessly stolen from the film "House on Haunted Hill" at William Castle, with the enticement of three million seniors and very bored nine of the losers to an isolated palace to win a million dollars in a game of liquidation. Of course, participants begin to fade quickly one after the other, and it takes many of the remaining greedy heads before they realize that the old people are sadists ... or that there is another killer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange story telling us a lot of meaningless things that are not relevant or even interesting in the plot, but there are some good things to admire in the first 10 minutes that show Bembo (Shelly, I think she called) is really Hilarious to observe. After the first half of the hour, it is normal for the inevitable to happen, and the "chill" turns into a Rebane-production school book with lagging plot distortions, the harshest dialogues and total absence of excitement. There was no budget for the bloody murder sequence but our multi-talent director (?) Tries to compensate for this through the endless footage of disco dance girls and amateur rock bands. The film also contains four or even five different climates, none of which is a little sick. Perhaps Lotter's inspiration: the return of the king? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
