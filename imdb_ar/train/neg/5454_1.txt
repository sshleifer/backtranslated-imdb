Wow, this movie was just awful bloody. Very bad indeed, although I did not pay for it, but I still want to refund my money. <br /> <br /> The film is not about anything obvious. It's a crisp combination of science fiction clich√©s that have been better implemented by more skilled filmmakers. The offerings, especially by the prospective customers, were at the Ed Wood Road top. Speaking of Ed Wood, he will be proud of his personal dialogue. It is just a great passion without any hint of irony or sense of humor. Moreover, no sense, no plot, or lack thereof. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are fine, but not enough to go "Wow, this is awesome" and it just seems to be being dumped for "to be quiet" rather than to be a good device. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack was another combination of things that do not really give any kind of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director was throwing songs in the film just for "to be wonderful". <br /> <br /> This brings me to my last point. Perhaps if the director is actually more concerned than the plot, the story and the dialogue rather than trying to "be great," he will not make such a vulgar saying "for a short film. <br /> <br />
