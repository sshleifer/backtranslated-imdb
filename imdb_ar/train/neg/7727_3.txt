I comment on this series from the perspective of someone reading the novel first. From that perspective, I can honestly say that while it was fun, I can see why it was not re-broadcast any time soon. More specifically, this thumbnail has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It is a terrible mistake. The actors that played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw, 45, was playing with Natalie Gastro, who was supposed to be about 26 years old. Jean-Michel Vincent, 39, played the role of Byron Henry, who was supposed to be 22 years old. Henry's other children and Pamela Todsbury, also played by actors in a very old way for characters who were supposed to be in their twenties. Ali McGraw sometimes made this mini-inaccessible. I've seen more convincing shows in high school plays. <br /> <br /> 3) The directive was bad. To be fair to Ali McGraw, bad work and personal development may have been guidance. Hitler's portrayal was exaggerated. His personality is more about his appearance and behavior than that of a charismatic cartoonist, sometimes charming, but always a demonic genius painted by Hermann Wook as in the novel. Some other characters are stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) and do not acquire the depth of character that Wok created. <br /> <br /> 4) This miniature is very dated. Hockey music, humming narration (it looked like a novel for a high school history film), and a full-time soap opera feeling made him seem a comedy at times. Also, the Byron and Natalie costumes are often worn as if they were in 1979 instead of 1939. <br /> <br /> It is likely that someone who watches this will not be able to read the novel first of all because it will pay off at the time Late 1970s / 1980s "Take it seriously" soap opera at peak times, rather than television version of what is certainly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of old and similar films are sometimes poorly executed, but this may be one case where a creative and inspiring director can produce an amazing, memorable, and highly critical production. I did not see this happen since there is a remake that must be long (15 hours) or longer to do it properly, and given the short interest span of most current American viewers, you will not fly.
