Even Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd were unable to save the film from an egg of the size of the EMU. Based on the classic Phil Silvers television series, it was bombed because: a) it was updated to the 1990s, and B) the simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing, weak and ridiculous scenario. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small group of talented actors to portray beloved characters acting with simple but fun swings. To extend this hypothesis to the film of the nineties was asking for a problem, and this shows. No one can pay me enough to sit through this stinking for the second time.
