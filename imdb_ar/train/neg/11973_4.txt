This is probably one of the worst French movies I've seen so far, out of more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Horrible scenario and mediocre / unprofessional representation is causing a helpless directive. With all this it does not matter how the beautiful French-French scene and luxurious music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these characters do not attract people, an audience that does not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how this film won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, man, I love almost all of the Cannes films, but not this film. Great disappointment for me.
