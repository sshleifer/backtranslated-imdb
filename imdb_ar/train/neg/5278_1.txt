When a comedy boasts a great soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not dealing with a first-rate movie. I have rented this movie with friends expecting to get some laughs but in general to get most of our laughs to each other make fun of the movie. We could not choose a worse film. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie was fine with some changes. First, the comedy was painful. Bad physical gags were performing and putting them. We made the chubby child in the film want to kill ourselves and bless him to try to watch and watch him, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If he had been pulled out of the movie, maybe everything was possible. There were some funny jokes, I think one of them was when a group of boys stole a pornographic film for the parents and turned out to be gay. But to sum up the best comedy I will simply say the opening gag of the fat kid. He wears a t-shirt and talks about not knowing when something is being done. <br /> <br /> To complete it, the film editor could have saved the film by removing the obese boy, excluding 20 minutes of school scenes and putting an end to longer than thirty seconds of random bickering. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements in the movie. Kadeem Hardison plays his wonderful role and performs his jokes so that nobody misses or is appreciated. Another redeeming element of the film is the beautiful lady on Landry. Her character is ignored most of the film which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time until you hire this one. I did not like that and I was part of the target audience (18 males).
