This film is a terrible distortion of the lies and exaggerations that have been put by the most rude fools to work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that depicts Senator McCarthy accurately. It's just a terrible scam and I'm amazed that anyone associated with this production has got another job in the industry. The Marxists of Lenin who wrote this garbage did so to attack a man who had been justified by history and feared that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took over the place where McCarthy stopped and could not stop him, and thus the end of the Soviet Union and his comrades. <br /> <br /> Never seen this movie I was looking for the truth regarding Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason" to better look at Senator McCarthy's reality. <br /> <br /> This will also help if you read what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
