I bought this movie cheaply in the sale process, having read the back of the DVD tray and assumed that in either case I could not lose it, if the trash then did not lose, if it was good then bargain ... <br /> < > I saw him ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher and Alan, but in this film, he was getting very little screen presence, and it seems he does not do much, so it seems that his friend's death is near the start Of the "movement" in the plot affect him very little, and his revenge in the end is just boring and unfamiliar. <br /> <br /> Usually, the film contains themes such as when revolution and retaliation are able to attract the audience and make them feel a sense of personality. But watching this movie seems like watching a series of confusing, almost random events that are linked to one another Unofficial towards its final conclusion ... At this point, I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was the most painful part of the viewing I saw in the scene where I sacrifice The pilot by refusing to jump on the truck loaded with explosives because of his unwillingness to kill any civilians is not as sadly tragic as it is terrible and painful All unbearable, though not as bad as emergency surgery on the injured girl. The acting was weak in all respects, the script and the story were weak, the "act" was weaker, and the "images" were not visual. To sum up there are good movies, bad movies, very bad movies, good, awesome movies ... <br /> <br /> And then on a whole new level, "McBain"
