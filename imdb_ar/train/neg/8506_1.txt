This may already be the worst film I have ever seen. It will be a coherent compliment. Until the end it had no meaning but it was a huge relief that it ended in the end. I've seen it with some kind of deadly magic to see if it can continue to deteriorate and has happened. At the end of this mess I was sorry because none of the characters survived and I did not feel very charitable about the actors either. If you want to see the train wreck, I would recommend the comment at the train station. Even waiting on an abandoned train platform beats this mess. Apparently, I did not breathe enough to fill the ten lines so fixed, and in danger of repetition, I will say it again. This movie is zero and will be less if I have a word for a lower rating. What about zero minus?
