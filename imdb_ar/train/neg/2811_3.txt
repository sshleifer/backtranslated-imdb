Will they make films without nudity and sex? This came at 3:00 pm on Sunday and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God my son was abroad or I would be afraid if he had seen porn soft / medium! Do people who make films do not care about those who abuse or corrupt? Can children watch the church and this is what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the thrill but ing! There was violence and bitterness, but this is expected in a western film. Randy Travis was very good in his role. If writers, directors and producers have stopped putting up a lot of sex scenes. What should happen to get them to quit working in this direction? Where can I file a complaint?
