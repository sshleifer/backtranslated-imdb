I read some of the comments flowing here on IMDb and I thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side, male leads well, some photography is interesting but as a whole the film fails to impress. It seems to be full of self-importance to try to say something meaningful but short-term and everything in the picture is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> It is one of those noir films that can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "Noir is characterized by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threats and cynical characters." <br /> <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losers stumble over each other with their collective problems including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc., conspiring to kidnap a child and beat each other. <br /> <br /> It was a much better film if the story was more confined to kidnapping rather than the kidnappers' lack of personality. I thought that the female lead was far from her depths and encountered her as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> While I was in some good moments, I ended up feeling that I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> 10/04.
