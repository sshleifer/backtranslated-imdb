You know that a bad film when his distinction is able to see a brief moment of "Jeopardy!". <br /> <br /> The most saddening thing about White Men Can not Jump is that it has tremendous potential. For years, I lived in an area similar to that depicted in this film; ethnic tensions were high, and basketball meant everything for everyone. It could have been a movie about members of the "basketball culture" very enjoyable, but the medium and dangerous scenario in the white men can not leave anything is required. <br /> <br /> The sequence of film events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a basketball game. He then goes home and hangs out with his girlfriend. The process is repeated. Most stories make a climax of some kind, but the "climax" that I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case is "Billy either wins or loses money by playing a basketball game"). <br /> <br /> In order to develop a plot, some dilemmas must be solved; this dilemma should be interesting if the movie will be fun as well. The book "White Men Can not Jump" seems to have forgotten this rule, where the plot can be summed up as "Billy needs to pay bills." I appreciate the change in the pace of other sports movies, but - sorry - this was just awful. I could get less care if Billy got the money to pay rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, white men can not jump is a successful movie. It is clear that some steadfast sports enthusiasts will refuse the terrible writing of a few scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, have been lured by the big names that play leading roles. This leaves me wondering if the cast has been replaced entirely by unknown actors and replaced with the basketball theme of the crossover, would anyone have bothered to watch this film? I do not really think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie two stars out of ten; the additional star is "Danger!" The scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trip.
