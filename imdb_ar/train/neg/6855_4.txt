Why can not a woman have a strong personality in the film without sleeping with the leading man? The campaign manager in this film, led by Tom Sellick, dreams of going to the White House. All you can think of. So, why on earth should have an affair with him? Nothing has been added to this conspiracy and served only to destroy the successful woman. The only value of this food was the sight of "we all slept with your husband". <br /> <br /> Also, can not the people making this film watch the national conferences they were deceiving? The shading of the two major political conferences has only served to highlight their complete ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
