Except for the representation of Meryl Streep, which is important as always, I avoid this movie because it has the quality of "Movie of the Week" dated. But it is worth watching if you take into account many of the internal stories: how the couple will be scrutinizing the media, and how to deal with the other. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the issue is the credibility of the other. Australians differ from "we" (most of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to them in an atmosphere of "strangeness" about them. The couple involved two religious (different from the culture) and two (different) sultans in it. So their lifestyle and mentality suspected at first. Dingos are different animals from other dogs, so again we face strange questions. The real story, then, is how the other community (and world) treats those who have different dialects, different beliefs, more than how we deal with them and how to deal with what they say as suspects. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the words "Dingo took my baby!" Without laughter there are humorous leaflets, unfortunately, all over the Internet about it. But in the years following the story and the film it was discovered (as you will find in online searches) that the older children were haunted by Dingos. Research by experts in Dingo animals has shown that it was not only possible, but that the child was probably taken by Dingo animals (possibly a husband), and was drawn with experience from clothing and dealt with it in moments without a trace. <br /> <br /> However, what remains behind is the question of why people defended Dingo when it turned out that they were putting children at risk rather than killing children to save them, and why because women were so cold they were supposed to be guilty , And repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Urgent questions, with or without the movie.
