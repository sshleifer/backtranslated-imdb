I began watching this film with great expectations. However, an hour later I gave up this film because it instilled only a lot of unanswered questions on me. This already began in the opening sequence and exacerbated. <br /> <br /> Why did they bury Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comic gift? Why did farmer wife Hollander save? Why did not he run for his life, instead of salvation, instead of starting to love the farmer's wife? Why did the farmers' wife, Hollander, not save him at a time when the farmer was not there? Why do these illiterate farmers understand the Italian language? Why does the Italian comedian know about Dutch gold? Why hide it in the pit in the middle of the property of evil farmers? These questions and many other questions appeared, and none of them was answered in an acceptable manner. So I think I totally miss the purpose of this film, and I do not tie the story in any way ....
