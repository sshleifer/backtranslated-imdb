As a 10-year-old boy, I loved the philosophy of "Love Overcomes Everybody" in the 1970s comedy "Bridget Loves Bernie." I understood the controversy surrounding the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Bernie) and an Irish Catholic schoolteacher (Meredith Baxter) and both groups of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bieby Osterwald as parents of Bernie; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) In intermarriage between spouses. <br /> <br /> Given the offer now with years of personal life experiences, I was struck that the show was so successful for one, though, high season rating. Created by veteran television writer Bernard Slade, who was a few years after the program was canceled, the play "Same Time Next Year" was written by Bridget Loves Bernie, a very light and superficial comedy that collapsed under its heavy weight. There was no denial of the real chemistry between Birney and Baxter. In later years, however, both actors showed they were better representatives in other projects (Bernie in his short-term role in St. Elsewhere, Baxter in Family and Family Family). Here, they were trying to broadcast life in a show that needed a more sadistic comic edge, which may have given deeper intricacies to a very controversial subject. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast Saturday nights between two of CBS's biggest players: "Everybody in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these presentations were smart and funny and had enough edge (more than the former that the latter) that kept my interest in attitude and personalities. Bridget Loves Bernie was not very smart and had only occasional laughs. <br /> <br /> This was another example of an offer that was not as good as I remembered.
