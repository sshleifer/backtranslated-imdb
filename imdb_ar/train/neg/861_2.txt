The film is disappointing. <br /> <br /> The story was founded by our protagonist, Krisy, a "young man," a sullen young man who does little. In fact, I do not do much to move the novel, so it did not surprise me to see the focus shift on her relatives. It is unfortunate that Crissy seems to be an interesting figure. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes felt good. So the question now is: When will we see Campions, Jacksons, and Tamahori tidying up through compelling stories, cinematic will inspire, rather than entertainment versus a two hour toll? <br /> <br /> Technically, the film shot is disgusting.
