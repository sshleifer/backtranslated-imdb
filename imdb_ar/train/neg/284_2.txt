I'm just today, I picked up this store at 99 cents just today, and I still think I broke up. "Dream to Believe" is a dull and unreal aesthetic drama and only one billion dollars is so strange. This film is probably only famous for two things: 1. It contains the young Keanu Reeves. 2. Directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also promoted the night. Now on the film. <br /> <br /> She is about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia Dabo) who was seriously injured in a car accident that killed her father. When she is not in training, part-time, with her mother and the step of a sister in Londromat owned by her mother's husband The abuser. In the end it is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, Keanu alone and some attractive tunes dating back to the 1980s prevent me from giving this first star, nor is it one of the worst films ever, but it is still far from good. The DVD itself does not get any medals either because it seems to be a source of old VHS and in the end, the sound runs out and when the final credits almost expire, they fade to black, although the sound is still heard. So maybe this can be passed as a bootleg. There is no meaning because the technical work of DVD is that it seems to contain modern images of Keanu and Olivia and no background relationship with the film, nor is it in the film itself, so it is clear that the cover images were taken. In any case, avoid it at all costs, unless you are fanatical in Keanu. I may not comment on it anymore. Maybe I'll give it to Snoop Cinema, a great critic YT BTW.
