Ladies and gentlemen, please do not be fooled by the slogan "A Stanley Kubrick", it's a very bad film that unfortunately was welcomed as one of the most serious horror movies ever produced. Horror movies must create such a fear that horror films should create this fear during the nights that people should reject their hearts while thinking of a real horror film. In Shining, there is no real horror at all but what we see instead is just a naive attempt and folly to create a chilling horror. Everyone knows how good the attempts are if they are different from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the Glacier. The hotel in which most of the actors are staying seems to be good too. The word Jack Nicholson sounds like a lost, lazy spirit that never knows what to do. There is nothing to be said about baldness. , A colorful actor who is preoccupied most of the time with a representative of a child. There is no need to blame the bad weather in this tragedy. Can not be avoided because the film has been created and the poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
