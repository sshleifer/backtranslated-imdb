In the future of 2001, Freddy was the last teenager to escape from Elm Street. Imagine any fears at all of illegal attempts at humor and unnecessary celebrity barrier (Come on .. Rossin ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF?), This is related to Part 2 is the worst that the child rapist got the devil. Wow this was a piece of crap. Not even the great legend Alice Cooper can make the smell of this film disappear. When the hell did Freddy ever daughter? The entire film is heavily backward in form, form and form imaginable at all. Rachel Talley, you stink into the high heaven, babe. <br /> <br /> My estimate: D- <br /> <br /> DVD: Cast and Crew Bios additions; move to 3D sequence and transition options to Nightmare (more additions to the movie can be found on the seventh disc of the set DVD Nightmare Collection) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom content: Trivia; Script; and Web link
