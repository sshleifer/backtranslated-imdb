Must be delivered to Steven Segal: Whatever his other drawbacks, he has a good taste for women. If you choose Seagal, there will be one or more beautiful women. It usually does not work as an eye cream only. They take part in movement and fighting, shoot, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo to Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and finds time to engage them in both bullfighting and teeny little lesbians! If it seems like I spend too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the film, though acceptable, is not so exciting that it's hard to find other things to talk about. Paradoxically, the weaker side is Seagal himself, who seems as if he can not bother himself to try to pretend to care. Being an active military type, there is very little fighting in it, and it is disproportionate to his role (a covert fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) well, which may explain almost sleepless attack.
