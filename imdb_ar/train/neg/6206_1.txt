Thomas Clay was mixed up with the wrong species. This is the problem of young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The movement in the main part of the film is slow and exciting and ends up as madly drugged as if, like a director, he has no better place to go. We have identified the main character who is a stranger from abroad, and we see him at school and at home completely unfit, and we feel embarrassed in the same as many teenagers do. Robert falls into the ranks of the bad guys and begins to lose school and drugs and before he knows he is a rapist myself. <br /> <br /> The film really revolves around Clay's complete failure to understand the links between violent images and violent acts. . Clay seems to believe that a generation of young, morbid people has become evil because of the scenes of war on our televisions. Yet the most disgusting part of the simulated violence was portrayed. Is this man real? <br /> <br /> If Clay did not see YouTube, he might be na√Øve and unaware of the brutal climax of his film? Everyone wants to see it is the ugliest scene from the end of the film, and I'm sure this will be what people will stay with. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film makes no sense in committing such a violent act to portray Clay not only as the curse of young people actively involved in preventing war, but also as a perpetrator of intense, tasteless violence for no better reason than Put it celebrity profile. <br /> <br /> Shame on all concerned.
