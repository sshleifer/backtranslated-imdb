Oh my God. This movie could have been titled "When the book hits!" What a stink. I had great hopes in this, mostly after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me wonder about the entire IMDb rating system, but this is a separate issue. I loved Steve Carell in the film Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, etc., so I was expecting great things. To say I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are many wrong things in this film, but I will confine myself to (a) the unreliability of any family that behaves like these people (exercise in exercise? Please), and the fact that Dan's personality is extremely undesirable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw to make her fall in love with him? This film was full of courageous dialogue, noisy direction, ridiculous scenes, slow, slow and slow. We withdrew after half an hour if we were not with my parents, who did not go out much and did not want to waste money. Unlike the makers of this movie, who would have better throw them all the money spent in making the film in a fire - it would have been more entertaining. If you love movies, avoid it like a plague.
