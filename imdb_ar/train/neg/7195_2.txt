Disney did it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" produced another film that barely resembles the drawings on which it is based and does not retain any of the original spirit. <br /> <br /> The "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and because having a movie about it might be a dream at the time. Now that this film has been made, I was very disappointed, even angry. <br /> <br /> First, we have characters. <br /> <br /> The tool contains the tools that made him a fun character in the original cartoons (with good special effects accompanying it), and even has some of the naivety of the original instrument, but is now more efficient and expects to solve the crime himself while watching Penny And Brain only. <br /> <br /> Benny has little to do; while playing a major role in the cartoons, the crime was discovered and stopped, and sometimes it was captured by MAD agents, now simply presented and then forgotten, although it sneaks at least To Claw's base. Claw is the film version of Dr. Claw, who was a genetically evil man wearing metal gloves and sat on his chair, his face hidden from view, beating his cat and supervising several crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw in hand, and there is no mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat are in the film, but they are somewhat unimportant. <br /> <br /> Even small pieces of animation do not survive this slaughter. Famous expression "Wowsers!" It has been mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and the Gadgetmobile tool is now different and talking. <br /> <br /> There are even product approvals everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" Advertising on a tag? Why does the Gadgetmobile app have M & M or Skittles buttons? <br /> <br /> The animators will be disliked, and others will likely find the movie substandard. When everything is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some dollars fast off another old show.
