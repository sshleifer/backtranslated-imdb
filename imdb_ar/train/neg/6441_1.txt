When I looked at the Wrestlemania card this year, I was surprised and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> It begins ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry at hell because of how much I wanted to recover my money. I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will drop in a classic way and then expect the same thing and you get their average trash every now and then. One moment in the entire show that was ruined for me was when I took advantage of HBK !!!! That same moment HBK lost to John Cena !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is like a loser / puzzler. I almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when I beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch the WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I started watching it again (fortunately). I have once again faith in the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest I've ever seen in my life) which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. Certainly, Mania 23 has been compensated and given us a lot of memorable moments too. <br /> <br /> If you've seen any of the Wrestlemanias before this, like those that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania turns me into 20 fans) If you watch him and feel angry, start watching him again and watch WrestleMania 24, it's a very classic game.
