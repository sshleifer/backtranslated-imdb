I am a very big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Chalhoub. I'm not a little fond of Stephen King, but I love some of his works. <br /> <br /> This, I should have loved you in 1408. <br /> <br /> *** Vandals can point **** <br /> <br /> I walked in passion. I went out disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of the actors. Both Chalhoub and Jackson play very small roles because the premise of the film puts Cusack in the script "The Man in a Closed Room". <br /> <br /> This was not a bad film, but I can not call it a good idea either. It was a chaotic mess that had moments of "Ouch, it's just a mistake," coupled with moments of "Ouch, that's just painful," and moments of "Oh, now this is unfortunate" with very little continuity - communication. Isleen's father appears once, and there is no obvious connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while trying to escape from the room. <br /> <br /> A former commentator described the Olin / Enslin argument as worth seeing, and I strongly agree. But otherwise, apart from some clever musical notes (the room is somewhat quirky, Enslin gives him one chance to get out before the bet increases ... then he gives him the one-hour countdown timer and the pottery line from the carpenters "We just started.") He Mostly "things jump on you when you do not expect it!" I write the horror that was fun when I was 14 years old, surrounded by friends in my age, and held each other in the summer while Jason was chasing Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film "Let's make it recall some of his most painful experiences of" thinking games ", with" Let's salute the paintings in creepy ways. "<br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I would have expected better from this film with the name of Steven King, as well as the actors I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never discovered the origin of evil. Evil is defeated, although we can assume he has been defeated. <br /> <br /> The end was just a threat of "what?" Moment. <br /> <br /> Wait until the cable comes in. I did not think In paying for it as a convert, but I feel a bit of a shortcut because I paid the opening night price for it.
