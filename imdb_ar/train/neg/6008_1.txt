If you make a mistake in watching the movie before reading the book, please do not surrender to the series. I bought my first copy of any book in May of this year, and I have already finished the tenth book. I dare say that the film piece of garbage does not do serial, so it is fair. While "Left Behind: the movie" mysteriously follows the story of "Left Behind," the characters are not close to precision. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never works his feelings for Hattie (he is about to be aware of the intermingles); Buck Williams is a blond hair writer, magazine writer, and not a television reporter; Chloe at Stanford, After a long time, at a meeting in New York, Hattie set up; Erin and Reemie were never "in the book," but just the ideas of Rayford in the flashback. The roads are very crowded with the shipwrecks that followed the rapture, where Raifford and Hattie must return the plane to the suburbs ... etc, etc., <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is only the first film; they Is about to release the third. Please, even if you do not like movies, give the book series an opportunity.
