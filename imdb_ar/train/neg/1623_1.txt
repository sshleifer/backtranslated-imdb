Ensuring the success of the series is not based on a television series on the work of a famous author. Yorkshire TV learned this hard way in 1979 when they bought the rights of books belonging to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Race Game." Mike Joylem was the master of Halley, the former knight who was turned into a special eye after an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to be replaced by an artificial accident. Joelem suffered from a severe lack of charisma (and appeared to be one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the role of Chico Barnes) made me think of the horses' backs on the screen. For six weeks, this less dynamic duo of the countryside has been accused of thwarting the nefarious plots to repair races, usually by the same methods - extortion, kidnapping of cavalry or doping. Yorkshire TV threw money at the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexual prejudice, elusive and repetitive, was quickly transferred to the courtyard.
