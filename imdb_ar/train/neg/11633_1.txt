If I can give ZERO stars to this game, but unfortunately, I have to offer it ... <br /> <br /> There is no one scene I can laugh at ... but the game did not make me laugh either. So if you're a backward folk, go to the local cinema and watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have already done here. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a movie where the children are shot dead to achieve humor ... the taste goes to the edge ... This is the third time I spend my time watching Boll and it was definitely the last time I took it out ! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> Please keep watching more movies !!!!!
