This is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not romantic ... not even a teen comedy at least !!! The story ... must be one end ... but this is disappointing! When the show ends in the film, I expect this role to be better in making the film better (for example, "Fight Club") but that role makes the film even worse ... When I watch a teen comedy, I do not like doing that often , I expect bad jokes and a bunch of nudity ... jokes are very poor and no nudity ... I just got one .... looks very good I have to admit ... girl, that is it! And it's a whole full-dressed movie! Bad representation ... like a soap series ... Do not waste your time! There is a pornographic story with a better representation! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
