I really tried to admire this film, but in the end it did not work for me. I've seen most of Kitamura's output and found it very variable. Alive, like all his films has an interesting plot, some neat sequences and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are painfully unavailable in Alive. The plot is cool if not all original and made for a beautiful film. Unfortunately, the slow speed is painful and the film takes the age to start, before reaching places fairly predictable. The procedure is almost acceptable, where the final battle is fantastic, and the other is about OK. Earlier also suffered by high-speed camera action, which reduces the consistency. There are some stylish visual effects and some interesting ideas that pop up in the dialogue but the film is still going badly. The characters are not well embellished, do not behave well, and the setting and the overall color scheme are too high. The movie is not terribly terrible and has some interesting points, and perhaps the wise use of the fast forward button can improve it. With about twenty minutes taking off from run-time, this may be a fantastic excitement in science fiction. But the full length movie is boring. It is recommended only for Kitumura lovers patient and firm.
