One evening I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apartment and I had "Gymkata"; I saw the way a lot of it. It's really hilarious, and really terrifying. Think of it this way - if you have an idea of ​​something bad in your business and continue to do it horribly in this way, how long will it last exactly? Not as long as this film. It is a must, obviously.
