I love the time period, I like this try, but watching a movie seems to see him through a coke bottle giving me a headache. If I play computer games that were blurry and out of focus, I will upgrade my computer. Maybe that was the way the director looked, but not so, she hurts the eyes and wants to leave after 10 minutes. If I did not take someone with me to this movie, I was there. Although it was a serial and not a film to say, the Brotherhood team did this. They made it look like World War II footage, with a touch of graininess, but it was a pleasure to see it. Movies need real people, with real collections, real sites; use CGI when appropriate, not for an entire movie.
