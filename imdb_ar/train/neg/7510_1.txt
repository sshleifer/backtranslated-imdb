The movie is a collection of cliches about anything there. It has no focus at all, no goals, no real message. The symbol is pushed above the top and the stereotypes are plentiful and infamous. This film can not resist the temptation to make the drama non-existent. Each small exchange of words instantly turns into a lengthy, unwarranted, and highly exemplary dialogue in the rehearsal of the working class. In the absence of any substance for this exchange, actors (regardless of their quality) can only help offset excessive emotions, also known as "risk provoking". On acting, to put it simply. The directive has no benefit here. Nothing can save this non-story. She is forced, fake and boring to cry. The inaccuracy in a punk rock with The Who, Piercing and Brilliant Clothes 90. The characters roam without role, details and motives. Arbitrary sites. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art torn apart. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it to him. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This film is my fault. Sold out, like the rest of them. Became irrelevant. He no longer has any interest in saying anymore. <br /> <br /> I do not want to see anything again from this person (whom I will refrain from naming from now on).
