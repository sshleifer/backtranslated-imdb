"I just watched this movie last night and I do not think I'll ever think of any of the actors involved, because this film will be in the back of my mind." <br /> <br /> The above can be considered a good or bad thing. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of a "little good guy" which is good. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown" which is very bad. <br /> <br /> I picked this up to think it might be something smart or at least make me chuckle and with Ari Gross and Swanson Perlman mentioned above, I think it at least will not be bad. You can tell that the film was produced on a budget like Wheeling, Indiana (where exactly?), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. Error. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny or amusing in any sense of any word. There is only and lasts for 84 minutes is very slow. <br /> <br /> Thin letters of paper. You are almost interested in the absence of any characters, and as potential customers are Hollywood fanatics with the dream that both fanatical writers consider a dream that this writer needs to know. Well, the real writers know everything about the on-screen versions of themselves, so they discover it too. They do not even think about personal development, except to try to link a story there back to the island of Gilligan. <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two people live in a storage center, one of them has a bed, and there are about twenty others living there. The rest of the story is contrived and stupid. Have you seen "Lambon's favorite mortal sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna revolves around a television writer who can not find a good story for a television movie, so he makes one. Now replace the TV writer with a scriptwriter, then Mantegna turned into half-life-distressing actors, and picked up the comedy and you own this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying to do that. Christie Swanson in the film for 10 minutes may still offer the best performance in the film. She's still hot, but she'll help if she plays star in a movie instead of producing CAMEOS down. For anyone else, I do not think it was a mistake for actors because they have BAD <br /> <br /> Go to see National Lampoon, but stay away from this movie.
