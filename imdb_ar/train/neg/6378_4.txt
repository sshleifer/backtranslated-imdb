This movie was sometimes fun, and sometimes hell was quite funny. <br /> <br /> Although the main message I received from the film was that women are responsible for all men's problems. Every time a woman is portrayed in a film, she is lazy, or a prostitute or a lame image of a poor person for no apparent reason. I do not think the message is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a piece of art, so it's simply someone's point of view. Even if you do not agree with it, they are still entitled to it. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie, but some comments made by others are just stupid. Best movie ever made.
