This film, which in the past was an inspiration for the politics of futuristic thinking and the portrayal of free love and sexual liberation, shortened over time to curiosity. It seems absurd now that this small, boring film has mostly been banned and taken over by governments in many countries. In view of how socialist Sweden eventually became, the "radicalization" of its controversial policy seemed na√Øve after nearly four decades. And her sexual views, once the subject of the experiences of obscene erotic, looks beautiful in a modern context. However, the film and accompanying documentaries that separate many of the differences and influences continue to be seen as marginal as an early catalog of the 60 Young Rebellion. One part of the film still stands: self-awareness regarding the "Wall IV". Every now and then, the filmmakers themselves make the film. This cynical humor still elicits a chuckle.
