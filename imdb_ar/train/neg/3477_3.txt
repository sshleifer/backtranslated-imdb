Not as bad as I heard. In fact there are some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have fairly good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and lovable like Affleck's interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are prominent professionals. It's good at almost everything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, no focus is placed on them and a lot of comedy is forced. The attempts of dark humor begin as they are. Affleck tries to be very excited and over-enthusiastic, but he gets upset. The caricature of his character is very much appreciated when viewed alongside the most silent Gandolfini and O'Hara shows. Even according to the comfortable standards of holiday films, you will never buy a "rental" for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes surreally bordering on strangeness. The X-mas scene is full of humor (the son is caught looking at his naked, provocative image of his mother) that is not only laughable, believable, but disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, and almost noisy. The house where most of the films are made looks stylish and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Survival" is often the attention of the fourth as a series of box office novels (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. Remains to see how permanent damage will be.
