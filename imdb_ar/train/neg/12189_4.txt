I was surprised by the high rating of this film, although if I were to go on a typical 71 scale, it might have been good, but it was just a typical film except for a dull, unreal slow. The typical excitement does not seem realistic but this seems to be trying to do, yet the raped woman has not been charged because she did not want to be questioned in court although she would put the man who broke her arm and hit her crap and rake her away for life, But also protect the lawyer who had feelings and his family is not just random people did not even know them. There were other similar problems in the film that could have been fine if there was some sort of moral to get away from the film, but few moral questions such as whether it was right to attempt to kill / defeat Cady before he did anything illegal were set aside A little kid because Cady ended up being just a madman bent on revenge, so make sure the lawyer is justified in protecting his family because waiting for Cady to actually rape his daughter would be absurd. Now, I have imitated more of my life for this stupid film, so please do not see it so at least you will not be exposed to your life for the waist and this way my hour and a half or so means something.
