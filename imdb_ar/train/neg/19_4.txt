I am a big fan of Arnold Fuslo. Finally I looked at him as a star for a modern film, not a simple part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got the film's appreciation in college, and the only thing I can say that I did not like is that the movie was produced in an abandoned part of the city and there was no traffic in the background or Lucy. <br /> <br /> I must say that acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk up to the bad direction and supportive songs leave something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have finished it as another bad film. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who fled in the end were good. But the sound effects of the shooting were very bad. There are some gaps in the film (continuity) but can be ignored given the low level of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Fuslo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
