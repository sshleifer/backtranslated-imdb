I am a Christian. I was always skeptical of the films made by Christians. As a general rule, they "do not know" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN to try to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a heinous act of it. The representation was terrible, and unless someone was familiar with the Bible in some way, no one would understand what the film was trying to reach. Not only was the production of the film terrible, but the people who manufactured it had some wrong facts. However, in these "criticisms", these facts are so irrelevant and profound that they can not be delved into. In short, the Omega Code is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I do not recommend it to anyone, except to lighten the daily comic.
