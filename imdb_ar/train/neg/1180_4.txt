Notorious for more than a quarter century (often banned), the mystery was the greatest it seemed. Hello, it's better to talk about it a lot, rather than actually seeing it when you can not support the "myth" of content. <br /> <br /> The film has appeared in Los Angeles several times recently and is available on home video, so the veil is slowly lifted. While there is still a lot of harm to the masses, it is likely to bear more than a real passion. With the exception of a free sex scene and a long-standing pair of horses ("Nature Documentary" anyone?), There is nearly an hour of melodrama marriage teddy bears. <br /> <br /> Once sex starts and nudity, it is a non-stop sequence that includes masturbation, the reference of looooooooong memories to the alleged "beauty and beast" encounter, and a naked woman around the palace (no one, even a supposed protective aunt, appears Think about putting some clothes on them!). On the video, I think you can progress quickly through vanity, but it is not really worth the effort. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something more fundamental like Bertolucci's dreams. <br /> <br /> Try as one may find some "moral" or "symbolic" at the funeral, and doubt it is worth anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can watch the movie more easily, the reputation of something "forbidden" has been raised. This monster has been tamed.
