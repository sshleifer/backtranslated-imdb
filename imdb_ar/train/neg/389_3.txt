I bet that Jean Simmons and Vincent Pastor negotiate in advance the number of episodes they may wish to appear in. Is not it supposed to turn Jin into the women's team and then throw himself with the sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell is that "Look at me, I'm a rat!" Double loop crap? All vulgar vulgar, come! The big names that have just been voted have already received funds for their charity and got a dedicated outlet. Oh my God ... This is not a reality but the drama staged! The other Mark Burnett's show, "The Survivor," raised questions for me when Johnny Felblay began his departure when it was clear that shortly before he was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
