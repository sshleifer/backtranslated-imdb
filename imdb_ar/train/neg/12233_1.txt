I do not see how the film "Concord-New Horizons" by Jim Weinorsky can show Andrew Stephens' acting talent and a bad puppet doll. It's just mind boggling, is not it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not make a mistake. "Munchie Strikes Back" is already a bad film. Munchie is a puppet that has been around for centuries. For reasons that are not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son. The problem of the mother (at least her main problem) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage within two weeks ... up to $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not get money because she just fired. Well ... just the keyword in this sentence. What...? Were they planning to pay them by check? Maybe it was good that I spent the last few years saving this ... Do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magic powers similar to those that Genie may have ... but there is no limit to the number of wishes you can give! Munchie gets the boy a set of fancy things for one night but then the child asks to be brought back to the mall that Munchie was "borrowing" from. The annoying furball game also uses his other alien skills to help the boy win a baseball game by cheating. Baseball was hit so hard that it swung around the ground several times. Unfortunately, these stupid parents who watch the game do not think they are strange at all. Okay. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to conclude this because this has already exhausted enough of my age as it is. Will really be affected by the scene in which Leslie Ann Down, playing the mother, kicked a dog screaming at her. Your heart will melt in its charm when you notice dollar bills fluttering in its front yard and wonder how it can snow during the summer. Credits "Munchie Strikes Back" Promised by another film, I believe, "Munchie Hangs Ten". So far, the audience watching movies has been stolen from what would certainly be cinematic power. Hey. 10/01
