Lipstick is the failure of another glossy film. I'm trying to think of something good I can say about the film, and I'm having trouble coming up with something. I think the red dress worn by Margaux Hemingway at the end of the film was the best part. Writing and script was not the worst I've ever encountered, but it could have been much better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye for viewing. The kits were very shiny and nice to look at. The cast was fine. I felt like Anne Bancroft's character was the only character possible in the entire film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting his time in this film.
