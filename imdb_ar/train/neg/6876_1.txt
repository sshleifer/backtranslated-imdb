Yes, this has been an unbelievably incredible debate. We know that the French often have a distorted idea of ​​the United States of America, it is a reinforcement and views on sex. As an American who lives in France, I have a great opportunity to monitor these positions. Although some of these preconceived notions may be true, one element of the downtown Midwest that was filmed in this film is real. A man never fucked because he was told in high school 20 years ago that his penis was too big? Where in the world will you find it? Juke box in the bar that just plays the vintage blouse? A city with 16 people may be less than two hours from Chicago, but there is no major gas station, no televisions at home, no McDonalds, no children ... residents know each other's intimate details, but they meet relentlessly like a big one Which hate each other. Adult males grow up in the local coffee shop, they have farms but they do not harvest, they kill the man they do not like in front of everyone and it seems to go unpunished, all with equal passion? The liberated French girl who will cancel the 17-year-old eldest because of her sexual generosity, the physical man who moves from falling into the cornfields as soon as the breeze of Illinois breeze to help defuse the 17-year-old farm? Help! I was puzzled and surprised at the absurdity of this film so much that I can not say how ridiculous it is. Go to see him from A to Z Primer about what to avoid. Oh God, I hope I do not spoil you!
