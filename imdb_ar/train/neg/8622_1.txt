Since the appearance of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, there has been a lot of talk about reviving Hong Kong's film industry. Do not believe it. People making films now in Hong Kong give a new meaning to crass. Out of time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of the drag, but he spends most of the movie smiling and vandalizing a coin. He flips the coin over and over again. why? Who do you know? Sean Lau plays the role of a policeman chasing after a beautiful, volatile boy. But again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress in the female who runs some kind of company and has to pay a ransom or something, but she often seems to prefer a spa or a shopping center instead of a camera. Nothing logical. no job. There is no gender. There is no comedy. All that is the name: Ekin Cheng. And learn what? who cares?
