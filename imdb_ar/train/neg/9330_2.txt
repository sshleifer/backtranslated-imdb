Recently watched this movie and had high hopes. Not much based on the director who did not make a film before, but more dependent on his crew. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (a key role in "Body double, Brian De Palma") starred in great films. Not however, this fact has not changed completely because of this fact. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, highly predictable and vulgar. The only thing that might make them a little appealing is choosing the sites that were photographed on them. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time in this one.
