The only reason to watch this movie is the wonderful performance of Thom-Adcox Hernandez, which is not used well enough in the movie. As usual Tom Villard is also good. Otherwise it c * r. There is not even the winner how magically changes the letters on the marquee of the theater to illustrate "The Possession"? Lame.
