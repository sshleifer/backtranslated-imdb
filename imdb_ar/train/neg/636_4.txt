Two farmers are struggling to live in a small village in China. He buys Wang Lung (Paul Muni) O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Louis Rainer). American stars appear in leading roles, speaking in mock dialects and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife and many children and land are the best things that men should get. It is seen as property and investment. Because it's a big budget movie, where multiple plugins collaborate, large groups are created and special effects are created, filmmakers can not risk hiring less popular actors. Louis Rainer won the Oscars for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the film. Her hard face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best person to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni performs better, showing his talent again. Another problem with the film is the end. Franklin does not seem to know when the picture ends. This film may be dangerous if it is considered a real example of Chinese culture and tradition.
