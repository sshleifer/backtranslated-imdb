An unprecedented hybrid and uninvolved from "hard intentions" and "wild things", but not as good as either of the traditional ones. It comes to the acting client, Artie (Taye Diggs) who is summoned to investigate an overdose of deadly drugs at the prestigious Univesity University of the upper class, but to keep it low. While digging deeper believes it is much more than it seems at first sight. We follow Alicia, the girl who took an overdose of the last shots. In about 90 minutes, if this movie was initially welcomed, it would have been spoiled. This film brings nothing new to the table at all. But it is the only film Miss Soen has so far disrupted, making it even higher. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain has become naked (fix the mistake of "Happy Camp"); another girl is naked <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy : More ass guys more than the nipple girl
