After watching this thing, then reading the abstract on the back of the DVD, then thinking back in the actual film .... I felt a little dizzy. I thought I might have grown and dreamed that I was a child with Down syndrome going through an endless forest where people drive 11 miles per hour and stop without any other purpose of tasteless lesbians. Where (the zombie?) Comes out of nothingness and (vampires?) Of (seduces?) Honest citizens on their way to save the world. No zombie nor vampire especially face each other. The only fighting I remember is getting Bonny Giroux brunette panties. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe it was because we were watching a broad petition and was too lazy to change it to the original resolution, but this actually made it more entertaining ... In conclusion my thesis thought redundant has more continuity, plot, personality development, hostility, subject matter, Of this film. Bloodrayne has made it look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
