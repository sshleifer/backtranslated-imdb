This was not all that great. Not terrible, hateful, or something, can not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> It was a kind of air, hesitant, or bland, just as he never knew correctly whether he wanted to go for laughter or for sweetness or to mumble. So we left with a weak combination of the three. The actors seemed a bit lost. <br /> <br /> Also, the thoughts were too tired and recycled, but they were shivering about themselves. How many times should we be told that the 50 in the United States had a normal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is something to be repeated? The old hat. <br /> <br /> The biggest crime in my eyes was how far apart it was from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in the entire film where you must keep an audience's attention for a long time - still need some kind of emotional anchors, a guide tied throughout the story, to make it attractive. To see the child "hero" an old woman, and two schoolchildren, and his father is ultimately hurt by the zombies or whatever and him to revive all of this with a smile and cheerful a few shoulders, and then I just struggle to deal with it in any positive way. My mother was the same. If you make your main characters inhuman at this level, you risk losing me and that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The most positive thing I can offer is that I like the look of this kind of apple pie and it's got it well enough, it was a nice movie, especially some wide-angle shots in the street and inside Robinson's house. Also, the opening news bulletin was fun, in a way of what was done before, but it was funny. <br /> <br /> I think Billy Connolly was fine and he comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Star Movie. I had this fear only that he would block him and try to steal every scene, but he played a very simple role for him, and probably the most sympathetic character in the entire film. <br /> <br /> All in all, not great though.
