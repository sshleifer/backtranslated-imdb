The biggest one who makes a mistake is because they say that Zues takes DUTCH orders. But she speaks German to him. The differences are quite different, as he says, "Well he takes the French orders" and begins to speak Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Peloschi gives more sense that he is a comedian and not a performer at the simplest. The role does not suit him, even if it's good to have a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypes / things to predict. Typical suspension or return. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at those things, I think it could be a great movie to watch on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
