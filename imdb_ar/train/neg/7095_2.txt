"Diary of an Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama of sexual coercion. Maybe a movie marketing scam, this click is a neat photograph with a good team and a few other things. In short, "Diary ..." makes us think that our sex-addicted personality has the dumbest wife in the world, and stable children on the side who have nothing better to do than just drop their inner panties at his fancy, and no job despite being a restaurant owner . At best, this flick can be a good drama. At worst, cheap sensuality. "Diaries ..." are not anywhere in between. This one is for rubbish. (Dr-)
