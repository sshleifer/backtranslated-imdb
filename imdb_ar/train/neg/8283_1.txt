This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke. Personally, I do not care about Jessica Simpson in one way or another, or her talent, or anything that many wonderful people find. Just like this movie, this is something that will not even get a certificate of success at the film school. The script is in a mess, the acting is awful, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") made me wonder what he was thinking of. I have done the Old School to shout it out loud! This does not belong even in the same case as the "old school" DVD! Please for any reason you do not see this! I think there is a comment that this is very bad, but this is quite frankly good. When we stop seeing singers who obviously can not keep trying, I hope it will end soon. The worst thing is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Lee Cook, and Luke Wilson) who make up part of this dump. As far as the plot is concerned, it is virtually non-existent, poorly written and written (yes I know it is another reformulation) and I doubt very much that anyone will remember anything about it. Please do not waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for ACTUAL actors involved in wasting their time making this bomb. Jessica Simpson You are beautiful, but you stick to singing, although I do not like it either. And from doing this film, I will not put this in your resume. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
