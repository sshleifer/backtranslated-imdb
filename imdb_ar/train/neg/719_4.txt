This film, despite being a virtual comedy, is very dangerous. Its theme is imperialism (with capital): how Britain, stupidly and humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that it is still a superpower after World War II. In the house, the empire is run through friendly people, and benevolent conservatives who are at home so that they can not distinguish between close relatives; government offices consist of a long forgotten archive (dug in the paranoid Orwellian?), Populated by lax mice, Bored and reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, Britain adheres to ancient pomp. But the pomp of the context seems clumsy and ridiculous, especially when embodied in a mumble. Carlton Brown is a non-emotional image of the decline, with no rotten spores of tears that distorted the presumed anti-imperial gem in the crown. <br /> <br /> The film also revolves around the Cold War, courageously recognizing it as a serious farce, in which participants deserve ridicule and contempt, not fear and respect. Revolves around how colonialism, which is characterized by neglect rather than tyranny, destroys the colonies it desires, steals comfort, power and, most importantly, self-esteem, making it vulnerable to the dangerous cowboy encroachments. <br /> <br /> It's serious, of course, that you kill. This does not mean that the subjects of interest in comedy can not be dealt with - both Morgan's miracle, Dr Strangelov and Brian's whole life have proved. In fact, one might suggest that serious subjects should be treated only through comedy - it allows for a clearer vision. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton Brown is that each position should have significance beyond mere comedy, so that it becomes heavier. In the three films mentioned above, a large part of the comedy arises from the personal reaction to the extreme position, not the extreme attitude itself. Here, the text is so bad that it can not maintain rich comic properties, and some of the greatest comedy talents ever assembled - Peter Sellers, Terry Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John Le Misorier - are criminally wasted. <br /> <br /> Terry-Thomas, often sublime, shows that he can not handle lead parts, and that he needed to play arrogant, arrogant boundaries, not toffs without brains. The music was prepared to carry a lot of comedy, but its heavy merriment draws attention only to the lack of hilariousness on the screen. (To be fair, unlike most of the British comedy films of that time, which were tense and underproduction, Boultings often try to highlight their views through the film itself, through montage and writing) Huntley only is able to raise real laughter, By writing personal articles he could have played in his sleep. <br /> <br /> None of the Bolting festivals have qualified well - he never thought about it. Although Carlton Brown reveals the retreat of the empire, it also seems undemocratic and military. I'm sure this was not intentional, but these mistakes have to happen if you allow the premeditated intentions to be based on comic intelligence and the film's shape.
