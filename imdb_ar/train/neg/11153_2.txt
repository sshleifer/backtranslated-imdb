Another in a long series of clicks made by people think that knowing how to operate the camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the whole hypothesis is placed in just a few lines, so there is no ambiguity at all, which eliminates a full aspect of the thrill. The only qualified actor was killed midway after 10 minutes of the film, so we left stupid characters around which stupid things are going on. Budget films can not afford special effects, so the CGI parts are not surprisingly surprising, but they were at least a good one. The creature's suit is awful, as we see when it falls onto the pavement, and the director continues to emphasize the eyes, which are not even the red color appearing in the mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspiring, with some lines that remind foreigners or Terminator. The last sequence takes place at the police station, and also rivers of Terminator, where everyone is hiding in a single office lined with glass not penetrated by Darkwolf. In the end, the girl named the hero "Good Protector", but he gets all of his partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention dozens of policemen, all of them killed without a decent shot, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and cannon Spray. But here is the real interlude of bad writing: they could have killed the beast immediately after the credits began when he held the flasher while his red eyes glinted. Instead, they took him into custody?!?
