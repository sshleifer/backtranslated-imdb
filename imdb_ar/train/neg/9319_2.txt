I do not know what you are talking about you guys, the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends we could not stop crying. This is one of the weirdest shit I have ever seen. This commentary on prostitution is very true despite hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes this film is actually the worst, but it brought tears to my eyes because of false characters, poor dialogue and representation. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to photograph them? Sounds like one of those movies from my drivers. Class. The props look like they came out of a theatrical show in high school. The music looks as though it is from an original Nintendo game system. The only thing that came close to my fear of this film was that he had a killer clown, who did not escape the clowning clowns? Hahaha If someone ever to see this, they need to look for actors verbal mistakes like beating on words and some facial expressions. Ha ha ha I have died. <br /> <br /> Susan
