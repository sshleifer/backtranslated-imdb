This film is just an excuse for the writer to produce a film of failed planners. <br /> <br /> His characters are just a group of characters with tragic tragic or comedic features that sum up a nervous dialogue like the only Woody Allen can write. Women like this because it's like looking in the mirror so they'll probably enjoy the movie <br /> <br /> But these movies were not enjoyed because there was no chase and the film did not see any fights. There were also no drug masters or gangs. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This film did not have snakes. Not my cup of tea probably does not ether you think about what you said before you find yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless of course the female is similar to have weight problems you enjoy the man sex and the city and mcbeal ally then this is the meaning for you.
