I am a big fan of Italian films from the 1970s, and I will not hesitate to include the beautiful Barbara Bushit among my favorite actresses of all time, so I have some hopes in this film. However, it quickly becomes clear that this film is largely meaningless and will not go anywhere. Obviously no one has gone into this much more anticipated, but the fact that this is useless becomes more troublesome when you think that it is somewhat boring and which characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on "rogue"; in this case one steals, establishes and escapes things. This is the basis of every plot that has this film. The film has a real "70s style" and enjoys the idea of ​​being very concerned. It seems sometimes that directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to express some points, although this point does not come well. Barbara Bosch's vision on the screen is always a pleasure to me, and that is also the case here; it is certainly the best thing about the film and the sequence that hangs from a naked car that is the best part of the film. In general, The Rogue may have some appeal to people who like the 1970s, but unfortunately, it has little to offer.
