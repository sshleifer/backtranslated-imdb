Take Rambo, mix in some Miami Vice, reduce the budget by about 80 percent, and you have something a few boys can reach at the age of ten if they have a large enough backyard and have a great ability to reach the " Penthouse ". "Cop" and "former commando" McBain (Busey, and a name like McBain, as if he was brave as he came) were recruited to recover a huge US bank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Taken from the tank. The love of Major O'Rourke (Jones) and former McBean (Fluegel), the commanding officer and now the meat of corrupt terrorists / spies / drug traffickers, who have no sense of morality, blah, blah, blah. For Action with Lesbian Sex, there is a scarcity of movement and not much sex. A running joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the shot as souvenirs. It is clear that the writers did not see "the seven wonderful" ("The man for us is the person who gave him that face"), and McBain is not thought to give an excuse for intelligence. Even for a budget element, the production values ​​are weak, with distant shots during the dialogue and very little traffic. The main pillar, the reservoir, is silly enough to produce Ed Wood. Fluegel, who may have been blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much bigger role in the "crime story" than Julia!), Must go from hibernation to being afraid to kick and go back after an instant notice. Jones, who was in an amazing range of films, has achieved great success here. Maybe both he and Pussy were out for some easy money and laughing. Look for the future talented actor, Danny Trigo ("Hit", "Once in Mexico") in a part of the stereotype, threatening. Too boring even for fun, still "bulletproof" is loud enough to play when you leave your home but you want people to think of having someone at home.
