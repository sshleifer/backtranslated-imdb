A low point in human interaction was reached by the Missles Brothers with this film. Remember, you who used lyrics like "masterpiece" when reviewing this movie, that the creep of Maysles this did not only lead to Hamptons and happens to film a film on some eccentric people. No, when they found these two pathetic poor people, they then had to fund their project (and imagine what they said to people's money to sell the project). Then the two women are very honest. Do not brainstorm here or share real compromise. Maysles smiled this miserable, ass kisses, and did what was to make the Belarusians cooperate and then exploited them brutally as before. One would think that these scammers have occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the process of filmmaking, given the advance planning, the actual shooting and the liberation, took a lot of time and their purpose did not include provisions that were actually related to Pilates as human beings. Movie exploitation committed by the most people. Over time, their reputation in filmmaking has grown dangerously because of what they have done here. Her reputation as human is unbearable. That's what people will remember. The hustlers are ugly.
