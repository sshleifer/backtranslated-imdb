The trailers for this film were better than the film. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I were waiting for this movie to appear on DVD because at least I would not spend $ 9. The movie is completely missing the tag. What could have been a great movie for all actors, turned into a B movie at best. The film moved very slowly and only when I thought it would go somewhere, it almost ended but did not happen. In this day and age, we need unpredictable movements and closures in the film, none of which has been shown. But it's all about how everyone is a good suspect, however, I'm not sure whether that's how they were directed, lighting, connecting lines, writing, or what, but nothing came of it. Lots of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this film and I told everyone not to see it. The cheesy saxophone music around made the film worse as well. The end had nothing to do with the rest of the film. What a disappointment.
