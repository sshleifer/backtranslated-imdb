I go to a lot of movies and often bring my 5 year old son, and I am very glad that I did not bring him to this. There are many references to sex and a slim dipping scene, however, this is not the main reason I will not take it. Trailers lead you to believe it is a lighthearted comedy. However, almost all the funny moments in the previews. I kept waiting to be fun, funny or anything serious. However, I almost slept while the story of the plot was less. I understand that dogs can be a wonderful company, and that's what's said, the entire story focused on a dog that behaves badly and that its owners were not smart enough to train. If a person causes a lot of damage and chaos, that person will be banned. The worst film I have ever seen with Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is a waste of their talent. The best way to summarize this film is that the couple get a rabid dog, the couple fall in love with the dog, the dog dies, and the couple hurts sadly. End.
