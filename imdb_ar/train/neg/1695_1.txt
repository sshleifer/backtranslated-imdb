Well, when I saw previews of this movie, I thought it looked very scary and was very excited to see it as the group that I was with. Now I live in America, especially during these elections, I see some very deceptive things, but I must say that these inspections were at the top of the list. I do not see how many people can be afraid of this film. I really noticed watching a real jump and just one jump. The whole movie was highly anticipated and might have spoiled some of the jumping scenes for me. As for sound effects that felt so much fear, I thought they were comedies at best. Hey catboy where did she come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie was a strange whine. How does someone scare someone? I can make this noise easily. Now do not get me wrong, I've always loved all those really scary movies that I used to laugh at, but I did not think it was so bad.
