After watching this film on SciFi, I can only conclude that this film is produced by a group of amateur who have not seen a film in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of strange events, or "delights," as the friend who reads on my shoulder tells me. This plot is not really worth commenting on, but basically crashed a plane carrying football players in the Yeti area. Before we finish the film, we have dealt so far with the tearing of hearts, but we are trying to run before jumping 50 meters, yet we tear the legs of the man and beat him, a woman who kills a rabbit at a height of 30 meters with the spear, which survived several bullets and was set on fire without any Clear damage, hanging from the cliff by sticking to a man's shoes, then jumps after, and a whole host of other alien events. Essentially, if you are not awake on Saturday for the stated purpose of watching the worst movies of the original SciFi channel, avoid this movie like Plague. Or when my friend reads over my shoulder: "It's the best film I've ever seen". "It was only Techno's musical battle that would make her better," says the friend on my right.
