The film almost laughs with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as a team as the mothers of convicted murderers. With the appalling reputation that followed, the two women collaborate and leave New York for California to open and sing and dance to girls who resemble Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> It became clear from the start that Reynolds had made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California. Winter plays the role of a deeply religious woman and seems to explode increasingly. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women living together are receiving threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who wears a blonde wig, was quickly kidnapped by the archeological father of one of her students, and played well by Denis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorhead, in one of her last films, briefly considers Alma's sister, derived from Winters. Pro for her film. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. It's heavy here and the weight seems to make it behave better. Winter has always been good in the roles of testing its nerves. <br /> <br /> The end is a terrible game and who can forget Winters in the piano that steers clear of this totally crazy look?
