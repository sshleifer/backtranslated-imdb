Trash / bad films are usually not bad because I will find them enjoyable. This is so bad that I run out of words to describe it - it's "bad" below. There are instructions at the beginning of the movie telling you what to do during the movie. Needless to say that the instructions and dozens of beer were not able to help me watch the entire movie. One of the occupants compares this kind to KILLBILL, which is certainly inconceivable and an insult to our intelligence. clearly. This logo had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you're considering renting this disc, put it on! If you are considering buying, do not think! If you are not lucky to play this DVD, do not turn it on, and then toss it in the trash immediately.
