I watched this with an increasing sense of anxiety. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these people in particular in an attempt to escape from the Island of the Devils? And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in mysterious ways, but help thieves, killers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness and heart changes in such an unmanaged site ... Anyway, it's hardly a grainy film. All that Gabel had through the magic was missing in this picture of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as gracious as she has always been to me, not at all, and the full movie appearance makes it look as if it was made 10 years ago. Compared to contemporary films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," this seems to be prehistoric.
