86 minutes wasted in my life. I was missing the first time I tried to watch it, and I have to say I'm not the one who ever sleeps in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a useless plot acting in such a vulgar way, and can only imagine that the actors were as hardcore as the protagonist in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adjustment has been overstated. If it is not a wooden representation, as if you could see the teleprompter, the same group, illuminated by ultraviolet light and overlapping in ways that were completely unnecessary and too vague to imagine, was enough to keep you away from the whole masquerade. . <br /> <br /> With regard to the supposed shock of the reporter under his curtain, anyone who does not see it - as well as the rest of this ridiculous plot - drawn with light years ahead, must immediately examine his sight. . <br /> <br /> The bad representation, and very decent representatives, along with the over-branding of the highly encrypted Branagh brands, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a homoerotica ruler that can be fully promoted in this, high at its end. All I can hope is that this was so volatile that people are not trying to simulate this level of cinema again.
