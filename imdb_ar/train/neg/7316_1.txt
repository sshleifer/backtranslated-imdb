When I saw previews of this film, I did not expect too much to start - about the horror movie of a second-rate teenager. But wow, this movie was very awful. This is generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the choice of the movie was terrible. Do not feel any sympathy (or in this regard any sense of obsession) with the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just waiting and I hope the terrible thing ends. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the film that have nothing to do with the plot at all. Can someone explain to me why a boy with a volcanic appearance starts yelling "Pies!" At the top of his lungs as he goes to Jackie Chan moving I have never seen him before, and even more bites the man infected with the virus? Why does the child's father start to get angry from the person with the virus and go on a shabby fishing trip to find him? I left with a feeling of confusion and utter disbelief that I said aloud, "Where the hell did this come from?" I really thought I saw some bad movies, but I must say Cabin Fever fever tops them all. This film made me want to vomit and then again. Then blow my brains. <br /> <br /> Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do a more productive job. Watch grass grow, perhaps, is a suitable alternative.
