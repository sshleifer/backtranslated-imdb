So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house (and not surprisingly) that the closers always close the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anyone, people laugh, joke and so on. This doctor tells them a scary story of this woman and some children. They feel frightened, and they begin to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees a ghost. More talk then comes this huge ghost and so on. This girl discovers that this ghost killed young children and that they should free their lives, yes yes, blah blah. She dies, but no, she dies as she dies. He goes to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape from home. The text is terrible because the man cuts his head and says Eleanor (the person who dies saves the children) "no". The representation is wooden, the effects are crap and the group are couple rooms used again and again. Basically, if you love to laugh at bad-made movies, watch them, but if you're looking for a panic, it's sure to miss this movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this. Too big to fail. My sister (who was easily sacred) felt bored in this film.
