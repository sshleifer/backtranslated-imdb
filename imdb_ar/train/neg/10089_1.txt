German director Olli Lomel was able to perform a task many fans of horror thought was impossible: his unscrupulous colleague Teuton Oy Paul for the crown of the worst horror film ever created. <br /> <br /> Lomile is really the new Ed Wood Millennium. This movie is lousy and funny as the best EW movie. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I saw him completely, very fascinated by seeing a low bar. The answer is: underground; Lomel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the international cast. Only a person who lived in Los Angeles, where every car mechanic, doctor and mail reporter is a representative or screenwriter who is expected to be discovered, can easily understand how Lummel found many of the wannabe actors willing to broadcast his funny conversation with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character, the evil tone policeman, is played by a German actor in a thick German accent. Apart from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest cop in Los Angeles. Although he stops the innocent women drivers and takes them in custody, then pulls them to his house (which is the upstairs floor of the furniture warehouse inexplicably), and does all of this in the sight of his rising partners, LAPD refuses to investigate and go beyond attacking one of the accused body In a ninja-style raid on his apartment. <br /> <br /> Groups are very bad. Obviously the budget designer of the production included enough money to get a box of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Since the actors were clearly unpaid - a sad group of European immigrants (perhaps deported if they acted in their own lands), bimbos, mimbos and desperate women in middle age - and since no Money on groups or private efx or sites or other value of production, it is fair to mention that they wear some uniforms official police. Unfortunately, they have not been able to buy a police car; regular police are roaming the streets by renting a shiny new Mercury. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story is focused on the dirty actions of the misguided Los Angeles police officer and the futile efforts of two young youth to prevent him. One of these young actors is particularly pathetic because he is the only actor in this entire mess even if they are obscure in a real career in movies. The other fits perfectly with Rocabili's hairstyle and Brando's torture, which should be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is where the title gets zombie, as victims of us are revived the killer after killing a girl who had just visited some voodoo priests to receive a protective mantra. Do not ask why a girl from Romania resorts to voodoo in anticipation of murder. Just accept the logic of Lomile and enjoy the absurd journey. <br /> <br /> After a long period of handmade claws from roadside graves covered with straw, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. She looks exactly as she was before death, and perhaps prettier, with black luster makeup sprayed generously around their eyes. Nothing seems like zombie, it is very much like a ready-made couture. <br /> <br /> At this stage of the film, Lomel draws a creative note from his beloved fellow Paul, injecting large doses of European cheese. Techno trash in sound. We are talking about prehistoric electronic bee noise. The things they might have played at the Ibiza Disco when Lommel was still small enough to shake his spoils. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel girls talk and act as usual ... er, as they did before they become zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us over his golden dialogue. Yes, a golden shower. <br /> <br /> Nothing will spoil anything by revealing the end of the shock. All I can say is that it fits perfectly with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood is living on ... or should I say I am fascinated.
