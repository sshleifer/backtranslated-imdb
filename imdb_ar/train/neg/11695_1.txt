Calling a movie like a "thinner" bad is like calling the earth or her talent at Paulie Shore. No news, but how they got this way is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> With regard to this film .... the book was good, even if it was a little derived from other stories of "Be careful what you wish". Berk plays an overweight lawyer and kills the Roma daughter and her father (Constantine) from "Room 222" on TV to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why involve the mob, Why would you turn it into something highly dependent on foreign currencies? I thought it would have been more effective if you focused more on the subtle consequences of the madness of weight loss, disease, death, the traditions of gypsies and the like. Remember, this is Stephen King, who we're talking about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... is almost the same with the book, But very little talk.In fact, the entire film speaks a lot, and feels that it has to explain every plot that resorts to us.This is not what I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another Pet Sematary, thank you for any Case. <br /> <br /> At least one star is trying to make a decent make-up in the middle of the road.However, the rest of the movie remains to be ... said to me ... "thinner".
