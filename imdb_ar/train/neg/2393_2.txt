I read "Tom Robbins" until his classmates "Get the Blues" teen. I love every word. It was exciting and funny and full of beautiful scenery and writing. But when I saw the film, I could not believe what was a piece of boring, sour and cheerful garbage. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood has read this book and presented it under the title "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the title of the Library of Congress topic). Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know that it has nothing to do with real lesbians, more than Star Wars is about traveling to real space. The book was clear - I mean frankly - written by a man of different sexes who liked the idea of ​​lesbians (in nudity, all the time) but never met at all. <br /> <br /> However, someone in Hollywood said, "Uh, it's better to give this to a gay director or gay people will be trouble." Give it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against a man, but - no matter how lesbian - he probably has no clue as to how a funny film worked. Jos van Sant took a terrifying fantasy of a guilt-free man / girl / girl, and the male image turned him into a self-thinking lesbian abstract poster. It's like turning Oscar Wilde's comedy into Arthur Miller's tragedy. not beautiful. <br /> <br /> The main idea that Gus Van Sant had no idea at all about what to do with the source material was the bad casting. His influence allowed him to employ the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a straight man, not the recruitment of gay pride) in making choices was not only bad, but strange. <br /> <br /> Let's meet EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Well, there are few recognized Asian actors. Pat Morita, on happy days, was fairly funny. But calling it CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Goss did not tell him). He does not seem to know that the schism is the same. . . Well, sexy !!! In the book is not the wise old Miyagi. It's more like Hugh Hefner! It is an old and difficult goat and knows a lot about satisfying Cissy & Bonanza Gilpian. (You see, in the book, they are not really lesbians.) Did you know that this is a fantasy of a straight man yet?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "COUNTESS". Well, he's a friendly guy for gay people. But he is serious, a representative of a brave spectacle !! You need a fun and welcoming person for this role. To be considered John Hurt as a clumsy man like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Schofield to walk around in his clothes like Thomas Moore, shaking his head sadly. "Now, Richard, you know that you have lost your soul completely, for shame, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and very gay) Caligula. But this humor was black, humor is not as fun and fun as the book. <br /> <br /> Ren Phoenix is ​​named "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problem. Otherwise, the Bonanza is funny, delightful, delightful and heterosexual (often). In the film, it is sterile, negative, expressionless, and boring. As for her taste for women, Rubens in the book puts it this way. "God knows I love women, but nothing can replace the man who fits." Uh, ya goss? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book Sissy is really a heroine and unusually shy. However, perhaps the most successful actress has created a flash in her eyes, or an impact on her career, indicating a kind of hidden power or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does not pull him out, perhaps because he did not tell her that Sissi was supposed to enjoy being a coherent traveler with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma is more than a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and boring. I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
