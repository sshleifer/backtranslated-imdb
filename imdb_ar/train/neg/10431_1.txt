I loved the first season. Quality dropped slightly in the second season, but it had a great average (Pegasus!). The third season was fairly novel and original and it was OK. The fourth season began to descend quickly, because they did not even begin to make any explanations, as we now began to need it. What the hell was Ceylon's plan? Why were there two factions? What is the purpose of Angel Carra leading the fleet to the devastating land -1? What kind of past had he had the last five ceylon, how did they survive, or were they reincarnation? Questions are everywhere and answer anywhere. <br /> <br /> Then comes the end. Earth-2 (our land) in the past. Well Well. But the destruction of the fleet ?! Give up technology and give up any kind of urban life, spread a few thousand thin paper people around the planet ?! This is not only hostile to science, it is hostile to reason and life-threatening. It then appears that the philosophy of the exhibition is that humanity is trapped forever in a ring that moves from romantic nature to a decaying capitalist society invented by A.I. To spoil everything. It is without vision, without hope for a greater future for mankind, and runs counter to the true science fiction. And do not even make me start in the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst types! Absolute disappointment !! <br /> <br /> Everything "all this happened before and will happen again" must be about the previous incarnation of the series, not just the earth as we know it. The new presentation made fairly consistent with the old was the final stroke of the geniuses. Frakin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
