Or anyone who prayed to see the Cleaver fight a naked 7-foot-tall black man and get to Nelson, your film arrived! The film star Laura Crawford (Ursula Butchvilner) was kidnapped by a group demanding a ransom of $ 6 million to be delivered to the island's hideout. What they do not trust is veterinarian Peter Weston (Cleaver) who was hired by a film producer to save the girl. What they do not really depend on is a local tribe that likes to bring young women to their savage cannibal god with bloodshot eyes. <br /> <br /> Almost the same images as Anaibals, this one is much better when it comes to the value of entertainment, thanks in large part to the funniest track and the impossible brilliant beast with swollen eyes (Franco stresses the division of table tennis balls) Disc Interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult support team, including Gisela Han (polluted) and Ferner Bushath (whose death is one of the most rude things in my life at all, showing me someone he does not quite like - trying to be - close - Trying to be it.). The film shows tons of nudity and juggling (the Tambra painting group). The highlight for me was the slow fighting in the world between Cleaver and Antonio Di Capo in the spray waves. Unfortunately, the ol 'Jess pads deliver this amazingly (and sometimes painfully) for an hour and 40 minutes when 80 minutes of peaks are supposed to be turned on. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the Severin DVD looks nice but there are some strange shadows that occur during some darker scenes. Also, there is a long section of the dialog box in Spanish without any subsets (they are an option, but only when listening to the French track). Franco made a nice 16-minute interview about the film and has more fun things to say about Buchfellner about his star at CANNIBALS Sabrina Siani.
