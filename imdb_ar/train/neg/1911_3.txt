Flick the guy who wants the girl, the guy who will lie to get to the girl's side, the guy who will get the best friend to help in a heinous way (comedus reliefus, no?) To help fool the girl, etc. This has been done to death, and with the rare exception of a few games in the form of z character, it has been done better. <br /> <br /> If the game is meaningless, potential customers are attracted and there are a few good moments. Jonathan Schash's performance has improved, and his representation here is approaching him. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this lukewarm case.
