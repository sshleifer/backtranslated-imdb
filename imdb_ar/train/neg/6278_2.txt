You have to wonder how some angles are made at all ... this skipping decided to why among many other things and wandering around the mirror. <br /> <br /> However, you have a number of decent actors who are doing their best to pump some life into the story. The blue color all over the film beats "back", which will lead to depression on its own but here it is exaggerated. The idea that it is not a medical condition, not some houses or a gypsy curse or an ornament, but just something that does not happen for a clear reason to our hero and then to anyone else around it, ends up becoming like a big operation. Of the empty mug. Some of the crawlers enjoy superpower but others do not know or do not know they are doing it? They seem to be as ignorant as we are. <br /> <br /> It's a poor man being torn for "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with Lever Sutherland's "Mirror" and "Sixth Sense", you have to seriously fail these three together.
