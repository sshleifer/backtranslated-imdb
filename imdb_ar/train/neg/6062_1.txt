Wonderful. The only people who review this favorably are Carpenter's defenders. I know a lot of these. The men who will watch John Carpenter sit on the celluloid and come out with a film and declare it a horror masterpiece. This "movie" is absolute nonsense. It sounds as if he is an avid (good riba, horrible soundtrack ...), and has a substandard pornographic representation, which is shocking, because Ron Perleman is usually a very good actor. Frankly I have no idea what Carpenter was thinking about doing this. Most likely "beans, beans, beans .." until someone feeds him and puts him in a blanket for the day ... they say nothing about the abortion debate at all, when they could have a very interesting central theme (how the fanatic religious fanatic of abortion feels When the child is the devil?) Instead, they chose to kill Ron Perleman and his children, who are behaving badly for a group of people and the terrifying doctors trying to calm down the evil pregnant girl. There is not one person in this episode or what you should safely get rid of. It's just awful. Like, plan 9 of the horrific outer space. Like, good God please someone turn it off before I soil myself awful. Try watching this and Thing on the same day and your mind will explode.
