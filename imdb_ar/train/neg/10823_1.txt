I do not like using the word "awful" to describe any act of cinema that has been spending a lot of time, effort, talent and money in its creation but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Brunate's novel "Jane Eyre" is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The script lacks accuracy and power. Everything is clearer to the viewer in uncertain terms, leaving little to imagination. The main actors are miscast sadly, clearly hired to name their stars, and the musical result dull and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry at all. It's like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who was at least able to have some emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrating emotion. William Hertz works the whole movie in one tone and this tone is flat and energy-free. Of course, the spontaneous and surprising script does not help any of those actors who wish otherwise to try to bring any whiff of life to this light to soothe the scenes that would have been better ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the second potential wife, such as the role of Barbie Dolls by Eli McPherson, is the blank blades. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very wonderful actress, is completely lost as Jane's Aunt, Ms. Reid. She was the best representative of Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Roth, like Jane's beloved teacher, evokes genuine sympathy or belief. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of Jane Eyre after Robert Young watched British television, produced in 1997, starring Caran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Jima Jones. There is no comparison. Yung's dynamic, romantic and deeply influential version is like a Nova explosion compared to the wet Zepprilli. <br /> <br /> I will be interested now in seeing the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, which I read about some very good things on this site. I am amazed at the number of people who loved the book Zeffrelli Yorkshire Illustrated. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this film is that the house is beautiful and that the cinematography is clearly colored, plus it is a complete game.
