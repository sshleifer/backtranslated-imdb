In my view, this is an almost perfect example of Anna Hollywood, which was won by only the new King Kong film. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even if he wears tights. Brandon Roth was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the beginning of the movie, I just want to toss a piece of kryptonite down his throat. He just looks silly wearing a costume. But enough, Kate Bosworth was a bad creature for Lewis Lane, supposed to be a painful reporter, but in this film she looks like a student. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, it's actually the son of Superman, who would have thought ....) The acting was terrible. This film contains one good thing, the name Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luther was wonderful, but he could not save the film. What I need is the film "Lewis and Clark" (except for Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching "The Hills Have Eyes" and I was shocked to learn that there were even worse movies.
