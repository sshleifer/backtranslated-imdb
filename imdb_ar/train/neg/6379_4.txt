With a film called "Gayniggers of Outer Space" how can you make a mistake? Just throw some of the characters' stereotypes, use Village People as the main suppliers of soundtracks, and throw lots of homely gags. The plot is not important. Too bad, this movie does not contain any of these and every joke is instantly missed. All characters look alike regardless of the German gaynigger, one or two jokes are working, and the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh more about the film. My expectations were apparently high.
