Yes, I know that "Talkies" was just invented for cinema two years ago when it was produced in 1929 but this film showed that many had to learn about the art of film production. It comes as a "Hammy" theater scene with actors expressing their lines in a grim way, blindfolding, using a lot of pregnant stops and using gestures more appropriate for silent cinema, which I think was normal during their education to appear more naturally on the screen. The gaps between the spoken lines must be tightened during editing because it slows the film considerably. It is now only the interest of Titanic enthusiasts who wish to see an early example of this maritime incident in the film. In the following chronological order they can see "Titanic" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958) "Titanic (1997), to see how the film's image evolved into this tragedy over the years." There were many documentaries and television films made including SOS (1979) on DVD, presented by David McCallum Introduction He was the Harold Bride Marconi radio operator in "A Night to Remember" (still the best feature film - please read my "Tribute to Walter" comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk) and made a comment on a series of 4 videos entitled "End of the Dream", so it was well qualified to give the narration. More attention I found was recording the Companion In actual 1912, the hearing in the US Senate, also on DVD.Actors, speaks of the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer, J Bruce Ismay, Managing Director of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart ("The Old Rose "in Titanic 1997) their voice is used for a first class survivor.
