This film was long and boring. Surprisingly he was chosen for the city he had, although it tended to be impressive. The important point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of this kind of art such as Kerchhoff and Krywishop, Girnze feels completely empty. Even more, it does not have cinematic quality at all. The long opening shot does not mean film depth, it's just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters encountered problems I could not identify at all. Representatives did not shine under her supervision and sometimes seemed to be lost. Leopold tried, but it is not a talent that I hope will be. Where is Kirkhoff and Kruishup? They have already made some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold has just made another attempt.
