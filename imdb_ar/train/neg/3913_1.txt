This film is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. Except for character names, the film bears little resemblance to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters and represented, most often, by non-Latins. There is no evolution of the characters in the film and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. The deletion of a whole generation is unforgivable. Isabel Allende wrote a strong book and the book is what to read!
