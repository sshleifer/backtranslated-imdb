Okay. I think the TV show is rather nice, and it always has a kind of lessons. So, when my kids decided that they wanted to watch this movie, I decided to mark it along. I wish I stayed at home and watched the TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is silly and non-native is less of a problem with this movie. The plot next to nonexistent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and worst of all, that the tool does not carry any lesson at all. Disney seems to be taking all the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and throw them all out. To be fair, my youngest child (8 years old) loved the movie, but the older child (10 years old) went out of his way to get mad at him. He was very big in the youthful humor but very small for any of the extreme humor. br> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies but this film lacks one mile. There's nothing wrong with having a very tight life band (say 7 to 9) but you should miss out on everyone.
