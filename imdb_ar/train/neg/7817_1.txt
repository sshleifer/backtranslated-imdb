At first I was happy to learn a new Superman movie, although it would be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> A bad version of Richard Downer's work, Lex is Nasty Again there is nothing else, so played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as the first film Donner I forced too much. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (all the things that a luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is the wrong thing, the story of Kevin Smith must be probably the best. <br /> <br /> Just hope that sequel without Bryan Singer and with a new talent manager to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everything you read later
