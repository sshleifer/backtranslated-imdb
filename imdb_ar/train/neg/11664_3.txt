I wanted a lot to enjoy this film. He moved very slowly and was bored. If it was on TV, it might have taken 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? There were wonderful photographers working on a false basis. If this is based on the life of the director, why did not anyone see that the writing itself was "loose". He then quickly directed him to the snail, which may have been the source of a few people who shook their heads during the film. The music goes up, but for a different film, not this one .... for an epic soap opera maybe. There were times when dialogue was incomprehensible when Armin Muller Stahl was speaking. I was not alone, because I heard some ringtones about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood make better films? This one was a block of big story, but was poorly executed.
