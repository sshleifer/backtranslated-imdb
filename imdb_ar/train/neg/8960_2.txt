The only thing that often pops into my head as I write this review, I will not get that hour and half again !!! To point out that I'm not just blowing air, I will compare the movie with other movies in the cube cube (cube and super cube)! The cube was not great but it was original and had some technical flaws! As a supplement I lost the originality feature but it came out looking very sharp and I loved it beter than the cube (the story was the best)! But the zero cube compared to his predecessors really does not deserve the complete lack of good foreign exchange, the texts f * ck * d and even just the old bad behavior is not well integrated! Example: All the time during the movie I was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if ... It must happen and then it will happen, so it is not too original! My advice: do not lose that hour and half you lost !!!!!!!! Oh, I hope this movie hangs and burns !!!!!!!
