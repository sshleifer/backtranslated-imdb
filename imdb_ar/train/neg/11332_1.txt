Great as Texas prairie and equally boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wells and Dennis Hopper can not float this oversized boat. Taylor looks really bad - the wrong wardrobe, the wrong hair and the wrong makeup - a unique achievement in her brilliant career. Hopper presents the only believable performance, and Dean presents in the climate scene a wonderful talent as something we do not usually remember - a comedian. Rock Hudson is his usual model in the game of Barbie Dolls and makes one wonder what Redford can do with male bullets. There is no clear plot providing any tension until the last twenty minutes, just a series of key features that have little to do with each other. With the exception of the Hopper application, there is no evolution in character, but a collection of cardboard clips that appear periodically for no apparent reason such as random targets in the gallery. Thanks to the fact that the film addresses racism and sexual discrimination at a time when it is taboo, it has SIZE, making it an excellent choice to rid yourself of unwelcome guests. Those who have a DVD copy can spare themselves some boredom by starting the second disc. You will not be missing anything of interest.
