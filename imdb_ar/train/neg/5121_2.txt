I went to this film thinking it would be a great football drama (like the Remember Titans); however, I came to feel like I just attended Ted Haggard's sermon about rapture. The only thing missing was the request for ten at the end of the film. In fact, it is likely that one gets more sermons from missionaries than this bad excuse for entertainment. At least with the TV guide's sermon, there are quotations from the Bible rather than quotations from the core of popular help. The plot was so predictable that anyone with a sufficiently long period of interest would have been able to draw the entire outline within the first 15 minutes of the film.
