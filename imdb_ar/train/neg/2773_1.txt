Until now, Gentle Rain was the film I found the worst in history. This "bomb" has been replaced by Asia. He has a "star" and one is John Reese Davis. He is on his way out of the game to become the magical flying bird who casts here. The rest of these people could not get out of high school. No cliches were lost in the dialogue, and the most influential were contacted. <br /> <br /> It's fairly easy to see someone in Asia has some dollars and needs to create a tool for some representatives they wanted to throw money into. Or maybe he is a director or a writer who needs credit. I think any career in this film is credible. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a big interest and do not watch this movie. One hundred Thanksgiving could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The only funny scene was unintentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. King? Handsome, elderly, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? Six feet European. (Also a bad representative.) No excuses were made for this purpose. They expected us not to notice that the brother of this poor man Jet Li was hoping for Pierce Brosnan's expensive wig "Injun" directly from an old Western movie of the 1940s.
