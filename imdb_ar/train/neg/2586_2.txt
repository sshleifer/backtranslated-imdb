Let's move on to the chase: this movie is a popular pornographic material marketed to the masses under the name that the studio is devouring every last penny of the American Pie Nipple. Period. <br /> <br /> The entire plot (which should not indicate that there are so many things to walk around) serves as a way to inform the public about more breasts and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a young Tween, and you are very sensitive to buying actual pornographic material, this is the right movie for you. Otherwise, the film has little to offer at all. <br /> <br /> Representation is asymmetrical, personal development is almost non-existent, the story is a meaningless knot of nudity, drinking binge. And pranks (do not forget any of them in particular). <br /> <br /> Go to buy real porn movies if that's what you want to see, and if not, go to a good movie. Animal House, Kids or even the original American Pie are great cinematic works, all of which contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not quantity, it's how to use it"
