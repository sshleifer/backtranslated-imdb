This film is not funny. It requires only the stereotypes that D & D develops and amplifies. All the main characters earn less than 30,000 people a year, all of whom live with their parents, all of whom are socially backward and have no luck with women. The jokes were horrible and unimaginable, like hitting two guys with a black bow because one of them was wearing a KKK hood (he was wearing a wizard's costume) and the other guy was on John Rucker (warm up) how funny he was, so nerd did not know about sport) . You may have to be a high school kid to find that none of these things are funny. The weak tenants are hard to watch, but it is obviously very cheap. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrook and Beverly Dangelo. I think these are the only opportunities available to Hootias after the prime minister.
