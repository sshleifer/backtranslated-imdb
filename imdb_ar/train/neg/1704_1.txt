Do not expect to have a film like this well, and not so. It's a budget-free movie, a very violent zombie film filmed with a bad-looking camera ... It's fun. It is clear that the actors have not acted before and they appear in their horrific, terrible readings. There is no conspiracy to see. It seems that the small plot I was able to find is that a government experiment has escaped and that a group of zombies seems to be terrorizing two families. The effects of injustice are in fact some of the most nausea I've ever seen. It seems that the bad effects have raided the Butcher shop people for all parts of the body, and many scenes involve zombie chopping people and eating their organs. It's a funny and important film, and it's as bad as you can get for any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
