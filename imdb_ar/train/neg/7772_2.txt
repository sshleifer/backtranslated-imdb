This is one modest movie. He has no real conspiracy. We are never familiar with motives, other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors who have been shown on the film. The threat seems supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three older people. Why do they do what they do? In order to strike fear on other members of the group? I do not know, I do not know. There is some fog from the fog machine that is circulating in the halls and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Do you do something? I do not know, I do not know. There is some nudity for her. I'm always amazed to see this in this old movies. Things have already stabilized in this regard these days. Anyway, people run like chickens, ready to ax. They have no plan. No resources no nothing. There are about five absurd climaxes in the film. Of these people and "Is" there is a ghost or a demon. What happened to other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with confidence. What a mess.
