Strange than the imagination that angered me so much, I've just subscribed to IMDb to write this review. Strange for fiction is a complex, surprising and thought-provoking film to the end. (Why did not Veril hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she began to write her book?) The phone rang.) The phone rang again. "How did you not know it was related to him? Film one's thoughts about death, fate and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The short history of literary themes by Dustin Hoffman should be particularly enjoyable with previous English majors. Maggie and Gilenhal are always a pleasure, although Will Ferrell may just be an ax murderer like a twinkling soul. Her fast confidence in him is a great leap in faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. Until the end, I had been given 9 out of 10 stars for this film. The film is a metaphor for the journey of life, as an appreciation of the concept of "real writing," as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy, but not both, wonderful. The entire film leads the viewer to understand and accept the fate of Will Ferrell. No matter how personal we may become, we know very well why we accept this end. The last act occurs, the screen goes white, the credits roll. The deep and powerful end of the film is almost complete. The end was to be discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> No !!!!!!!!!! No credits rolled. Say this is not so. Hollywood did not say another 10 minutes of waste that completely undermined the film's safety and heart. Dustin Hoffman believed it when he said: "It's no longer a masterpiece, it's fine." Appropriate review of the film. Except for me, it was not even OK. I was insulted by the betrayal of the "real writing" about the decision to strip him of the film so much that I actually burst into the angry cry that explains this as he drives home from the movie. I do not cry very much. I did not care much about most of the films, but I'm still angry at this film. <br /> <br /> My questions about Zack Helm, author, do this: Did the original movie end when the screen became white? Did the forces of the obscene film force the film to end its betrayal? Or have you finished this mud that ended up? I have read that you are wonderful. I hope the original script ends the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this review, and I could not find a contact to ask myself. But, please, cinema pioneers, am I the only person who feels this way about the strange of fiction? One good thing came from me seeing this movie: I'm a double admirer LOST IN TRANSLATION right now.
