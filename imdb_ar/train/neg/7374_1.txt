This is without a doubt the worst film released by Steven Segal. Which says a lot. Do not be fooled by evaluation, it's a very good way. This scoundrel was not even worth a 0/10 evaluation, if there was such a thing. <br /> <br /> - Certainly there is no conspiracy <br /> <br /> - The worst scenes of motion at all, and there are not many of them either <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything himself, including In that fighting, talking (a lot of dubbing), and so on. as always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and does not care much about this movie. Something very clear all the way. <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV movies neglected by Seagal, hit them with each other, hit them with a thousand billions, and all the bad you will win then "t even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
