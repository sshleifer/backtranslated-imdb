This film has little to do with his predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why his most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternate name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch he had a nice hypothesis of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned, and instead, it is characterized by a completely boring story as well as not very original or intelligently written. It's a shame that she tried to be quite different from her predecessor, otherwise it might be a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Just like "Robot Jox", it's a B movie - but with a big difference it's not just a very good idea. This may also be due to the fact that "Robot Jox" was made during the 1980s, when B films still had some magic and class, although the film was released in 1990. This can not be said about this film. It's just lame, bad-made, bad-looking and not exciting enough. She also has an ending that makes you think "this is all?" <br /> <br /> What his story lacks is a really good, clear-cut landline story ... Perhaps the good main villain was a good idea and some other things like Or some of the favorite characters or actions. <br /> <br /> Seriously what they were thinking about when they chose actors for this film are simply not likable in their roles, especially that Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character who acts as If it were God's gift to women and Mr. Perfect who could compete with anyone, they could not even get representatives from the A For this futuristic film, with the concept of having big battle robots in it, this film certainly lacks it: if they had done more and more in the film, the film would have been at least fun to watch. We have a film that has failed to affect fundamentally every imaginable way. <br /> <br /> You can see the episode "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers" better, for more movement and admiration. <br /> 3/10
