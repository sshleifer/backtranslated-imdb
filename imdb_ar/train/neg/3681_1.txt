My God this movie is bad. I was completely misled by my assessment of the local film because the trash is reliable. Yes, yes, the good men wear white, while the bad guys are wearing black .... and the good men always win. Now go home and hug your kids, and feel how satisfied Hollywood is. BLECH! I can not believe that this dead film of the brain is made by Wes Craven. I think he needed a little money to pay the mortgage, so he did this piece of dung. It is this kind of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly think he can do a good job or better than such an experienced director. <br /> <br /> You see, a bad man wants a pretty girl who loves her father to do something bad or bad, her father. But because she is an American girl all around, we know that she will save time and overcome the bad guys ... in the end. The power of rock girls. <br /> <br /> C'mon now, only a fool will find this entertaining ... "roller coaster ride", not to mention something new or new. All those "super-deceptive" reviews you see on this site are hackers in the industry who earn money against this veto, pay any compensation, or sell their lives to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is beautiful .... Yes, that's it. Not a good performance, not a terrible performance ... it's just nice. She had to show a large selection of skin to save this film. It is not strong enough to be a leader in the women's movement. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was acceptable at least in 28 days. But here he plays the role of a stupid villain pretending to be intelligent. Gets ass kicked and back by 5'5 '' McAdams, because after all, she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all Tai Po tapes .. so you should be able to kick the crap out of International terrorist for hire. I would not trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7 to 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Hey, this movie was done before, before they do it well. Go to re-rent any of Die Hard's movies. You have your loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except the characters you love and believe, and the wicked are more efficient and interesting. I simply do not understand how Hollywood could continue to make such nonsense as if it were oblivious to the appropriate models that could be copied easily. No wonder the film's revenues have fallen. <br /> <br /> Throw $ 6 into the toilet and save yourself two hours of your life you will never return to. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
