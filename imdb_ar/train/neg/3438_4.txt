The popular boat "The Fog" is meeting with "Open Water". In many ways this is accurate. There are fears and people looking strangely to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the ability to represent is weak at best. Show clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends making a horror film. It is at all credit they do everything they can. When you accept a low budget, it becomes very difficult for special effects, where ghosts look like men wearing rubber masks. <br /> <br /> There are many aspects of the movie creepy and strange. But it involves a lot of twists and turns in a short period of time, making you feel bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake, the film does a very good job. By ignoring the irrelevant torsion every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. Ready to wait for an hour and 35 minutes to reach its peak. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship but it will definitely do an evening in front of T.V.
