Well, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that led to the decline of this film is that there will be an hour of stills, and then that same clock is repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Gathering troops and discussing attack plan, 2. Past memories of men's wives 3. Approach troops marching in a long queue. Then 3 other men save him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call the base to see success 6. Men refer to wives and sing 10 minutes songs. This was the main film, and the same arrangement of events occurred about 4 or 5 times. Every time he mentions wives, he will appear to the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who were suffering from flashback, so it took a lot of time. Otherwise, men could only kill their enemy with bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of work, although the procedure was repetitive. In general, I probably would not see it again, but it was not terribly awful.
