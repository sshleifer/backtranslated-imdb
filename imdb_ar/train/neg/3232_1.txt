This film has no plot, no personal development, no budget. It really sucks to put it in short intervals. Since there is no evolution of the film, it can not even seem to be trying to be a technician or trying to make a statement against torture. Leaving two other reasons perhaps to watch it. To feel shocked or go down like a sick little freak. Well, they are short here as well. The girl's reactions are just stupid. It's very easy to say it's fake (professional wrestling looks more truthfully than the crap they're trying to get in this film.) They throw it on inner stones, but it's dormant for most of them, so it's a little stupid, the really good part is the end when they move quickly from place to place Before the needle enters her eyes, but frankly the girl is very ugly and everything is incredibly fake, except for the eye, if you want a good film about torture, go to Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do both contain realistic violence, A real story that draws you and cares about people The level of deeper subjects such as American concerns of foreigners, ethics issues, testing the extent to which anyone can go, human instincts versus civilization, and many other things, plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story is not centered on the iolence. These are far better options on this piece of crap
