Think of a budget-free version of China Syndrome directed by a film student who expresses John Wu and gets a "Power Play". It was a good idea, but execution, representation and dialogue caused her death altogether, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and sequence of disasters used to make up for the lack of materials and the development of the most interesting parts of the film. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of the group of guerrilla activists who mysteriously lost after storming the offices of a power plant suspected of causing an earthquake. The knight reporter, who is struggling what should have been a harsher bunch of company execs, is being chased around the city (along with anyone talking to him) in order to "clean up" any conclusive evidence that may remain from factory errors. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because characters interact with a lot of hesitation, along with stupid dialogue and a lot of terrible representation. Not to mention that the viewer, who may be attracted only to the film because of its attractiveness to the type of movement, is forced to endure an increasing number of body and a ridiculous amount of violent shooting in addition to the scenes of the earthquake disaster. Each focus was put in the wrong place to make up for apologizing for the lack of direction and a more interesting sequence of events that should have driven the story. It may have been much better for filmmakers to focus more on excitement and pay more attention to developing corruption in this story. The creepy bad guys, the naive reporter, and those who try to alert the reporter of the wrong acts equally. It is equivalent, but at least it was amusing.
