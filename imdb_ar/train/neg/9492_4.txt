One Star for "The Plot". One star representation. One star for dubbing into a clear American. Five stars for Monica Brock and Ing Maria Granzo, with their inclination to take off their clothes. And 10 out of ten for Emmanuel Burt, two years before making "Manon des sources." BÃ©art also takes off a few times, but its fully clothed existence is enough to make this film a wonderful sight. Watch out for the place where her friend tells about the girl's "three times". It is grainy, but it is still more exciting than the laughingly designed "Love Scenes" which included Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, cinema is not great. The closing credits are a better indicator of David Hamilton's ability.
