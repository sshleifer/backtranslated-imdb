* Contains some spoilers * This horror film is 80s cheesy with all its horrors. This plot takes a very long time to get to the ground, never stabilizes, and then crashes after about 40 minutes in the film. There are a few moments of gems for zombie lovers, but there is not enough zombie to create a real sense of terror. <br /> <br /> Zombies also take a long time to appear. First, there is a half full movie about mobs and prison gangs. The hero of the film is a former veterinarian of Vietnam preoccupied with the mob. The head of the main mob puts him and goes to jail. In this prison, prisoners are being tried to find a way to treat them from murder tendencies and criminal behavior. But head psychotic badie / military man has other plans in mind. He wanted to use a slightly different version of the serum to make .... da da da .... super soldiers! After some of the injured prisoners kill a number of guards and most of them have a round of the injured company's wine, the military / madman goes "hey this may be a problem" and gives an invitation to the genius scientist who turned into a hot investigative journalist. Of course the original serum. You go to jail to see what's happening, and the military man in a few Swat teams calls from his safe location outside the prison. The hero is responsible for the few prisoners who have a heart of gold when riots break out. The hero and the scientist / journalist collaborate together to find a cure, save the children of the observer, and deal with some angry prisoners, whether infected or unaffected. Meanwhile, the mob man entered into a deal to get into prison so he could save his imprisoned brother. The army prepares to blow up the place, everyone inside scramble to find a way out. <br /> <br /> There are lots of deadly scenes where people are killed by pressing them or pressing them through prison bars. There is also a scene of a creeping head and a scene of electric shock that includes the same prisoner as the injured Rasta. However, the most disturbing scene is in the first part of the film, when one of the corrupt guards raped a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is one scene at the end. The hero, woman and child try to make their way to the only escape route. Their road leads them to a long corridor, on the one hand there is a wall and on the other the bars of the prison. Hundreds of bloody zombies reach through her, swearing her hair and face as she passes. There are also a few good scenes about "a couple of zombies mummifying dead bodies" and "many zombies are dragging a man to pieces." <br /> <br /> In general, it's worth watching if you're looking for a zombie. The genre because it contains a lot of zombie cliches is worth mentioning; it's practically a guide on what to do when making a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie clicks and want real fear, you should look elsewhere.
