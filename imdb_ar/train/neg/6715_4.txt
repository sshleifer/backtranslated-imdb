I entered the theater and I intend to spend 90 minutes enjoyable if you are not enlightened. I left neither absolute nor enlightened. This film can not decide what it wants to be and ends up not being too much. There are a few funny lines and a few incredible cinematic references (The 400 Blows - for this character? While none of the characters are treated with great respect, more than thirty gay men are getting worse: they are all predators, fat, sad. If you're in the mood for a gay film, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, and Philadelphia instead. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
