What to say about this film. Well, it's about a group of good students who have some bad drugs and become delinquent students who sell more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have harmful effects where one turns into a kind of poisonous avenger and his girlfriend throws some creatures that grow in the school cellar. That's all it is and extend it for 84 minutes. This movie is very bad and must be closed forever. Although this is not fair, some people like Troma movies and can watch them if they want. Troma movies for me are the worst movies out there. I saw this thing out of obsessed curiosity.
