Facts about National Lampoon go to movies, for example, National Lambon's Madness: 1. The film is lousy, even by the standard Lambon standards. 2. This is not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished watching it, I started wondering why the Earth was called "National Lampoon Goes to Movies" and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers "an American man going to the movies." How lame. He is not an American, he does not go to movies. There are no characters in the so-called "irony" of the funny "Lambon," no one goes to watch movies, which cause a small problem. I was hoping this would be something in the context of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was National Lampoon's first film after Animal House, although you could not tell him the quality of the film. Poor growth, coarse and amateur by any standard, it causes headaches? Not a good sign for a 89-minute movie that looks twice as long. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Bad movies are usually renamed ?? This small disaster falls under this category. Has two separate titles - perhaps to help try to promote him to people so stupid they do not remember how bad he received from domestic video critics in 1982/1983. "Hey, wait a moment, this is just a movie," The National Lamp Goes to the Cinema! " <br /> <br /> Commented by MGM / UA, it has never been released in theaters or DVDs; it sometimes appears on TV several times every 10 years, and is almost the only place you can find it. <br /> <br /> It is divided into three floors? A spoof of self-expansion videos, butter, corporate cruelty and police brutality movies / policeman friends (I think). The first part starring Peter Riggert as a frustrated man divorcing his wife and doing some other things. I'm not sure about it because it was very boring. Until the sexual scene appears. <br /> <br /> The second part revolves around a strange dancer who is raped by a stick of butter (do not ask) who decides to become the queen of ghee until she can cut off her supplies. Dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the film: "Only I Can Love You With My Son!" If you think this does not seem very funny, are you right? it's not. just imagine ?? It's the most important part of this film! <br /> <br /> The third part revolves around a policeman chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) to lose his temper and shoot at the man. It has one funny scene but it is very overpriced? Lloyd only really displays any teaser, his character plays dry and emotional, but strangely surreal. The part that suffocates his victim and the watchful policeman watches everything that unfolds, at least, with a muffled laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to watch such a number of famous names resorting to low standards. It is clear that the writers of each segment think they are cynical and intelligent by deceiving so-called stereotypes? The error is that the film becomes a big contrast, preferring the T & A standard rather than painting; raw humor rather than a witty dialogue. Desperate offers instead of inspirational presentations. It is easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled by the material, muted, and often so awkward that they rarely communicate with the eye with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, in just one line, and even then had a heart line. A chuckle, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to the movie Madness, a number of decent comedy films look like normal laughter tracks. <br /> <br /> I love the National Lampoon holiday series (or, at least three of the four batches), and the classic Animal House, but a large number of direct bombs to the video such as the game of Golf Punks (however great comic genius Tom Arnold) provides a good example of why their magazine ran out more than a decade ago. It becomes old and really fast. <br /> <br /> Sadly, a new movie called Gold Diggers is showing with the "Approval Seal". It's like condemning a movie before it reaches the theaters ?? Maybe they should start not to advertise their names everywhere? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. You get a national authentication stamp. This will teach you not to do something bad next time. "<br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty, just stick to a bunch of criminals in the room and watch them again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even start In explaining his corrupt evil I give up.
