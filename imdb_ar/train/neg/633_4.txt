Good land follows the life of a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel Pearl Buck. The story is wonderful, but I hated that they decided to choose Los Angeles in the leading roles. Walter Connolly is funny as the farmer's father. He has a heavy American accent, like most major actors, so much so that I could not bear to listen to him as he spoke. In leading roles. Taking Anglos and making him look like the Chinese language looks like Los Angeles puts polish shoes on their faces to play with African Americans.
