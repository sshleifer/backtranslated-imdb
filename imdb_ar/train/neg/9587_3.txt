Parks of the fifties (London) Soho and people coming. Based on the cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give it $ 15 million, and it will make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here forget that two minutes with people can not do anything real - but two hours? What he was thinking. Besides who are the audience? Who cares about the book that was well remembered when going back. The usual London story of a chancer took his chance. <br /> <br /> What can really pull this movie further? I know that third-rate songs look as if they were made up right away. David Bowie repeatedly titled the movie several times, this is the highlight. The soundtrack album is a clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing though. Good entertainment from Soho period. Shame they could not think of anything they put in front of him.
