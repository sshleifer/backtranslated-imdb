A few days ago, I saw a documentary entitled "The 50 Worst Films Ever", and this is where I first heard of the incredible dissolving man. As a lover of blockbuster films, I find a point in trying to find some of the films from the documentary - not just the incredible melting guy. In fact, MELTING MAN is considered the first bad film I have seen since then and I must say I am somewhat disappointed. Although it is a really bad film, it is not close to being included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now before watching the documentary, I've enjoyed "bad movies" since I read "The 50 Worst Movies of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the title itself, the book was released long before a long documentary, and the filmmakers never woven Medved's concept. From the Medved book, I watched about 35 out of 50 films but I reached a dead end - the rest of the films are not available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought I would try the movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with the amazing soliloquy man was that there were some good elements of the film. First, the melting effects of the private man were really wonderful and disgusting. It is clear that the professional (Rich Becker famously) co-made this outlook realistic. However, I would also like to point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects too - like floating plastic head and the way a monster wanders after cutting his left arm - you can see it "cleverly hidden" under his clothes! For the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously pierces the Saturn rings without being crushed. Then, comment on the beauty of the sun - as we see close to it. This is strange because Saturn is far from it - it should not look that way - it should be a big spot. Regardless, the scene immediately changes and tells us that one of the surviving astronauts in the hospital. What happened between the last scene and this scene? Yes, it's guessing one. Well, soon after, the survivors escape the deadly frenzy and melt his whole body. <br /> <br /> Now given that they have a psychic revolving around who looks like a dissolved lollipop, you think the government will pull every stop to find it and stop it, right ?! Error. General involved a single doctor to find him !! No army and no police - just a Dobby doctor. Even after the bodies begin to accumulate, the doctor or general does nothing at any time to organize meaningful research or obtain a backup copy. <br /> <br /> Now, given the stupidity of the film, you will not be too surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the dude runs near the doctor's home, the doctor gives his wife a strong soothing and leaves her at home. <br /> <br /> The gentle old couple drive late at night and naturally stop at a grove to reap the fruits and kill. <br /> <br /> When you see a lady melt, you barricade the door to protect herself. It would be smart if you did not have a back door for the house next to it! Instead of just leaving home and running away, just wait! <br /> <br /> When the photographer and his model take the shots, the man gets his assistant and snaps from the top. why? Well, to give the audience a cheap spin and make it a flick. <br /> <br /> When the smelting site is finally determined, and the Brigadier has a clear bullet in his face, the doctor will stop him - although the beast has now killed about six people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see the movie is full of stupid plot elements. It's a very bad film. But, given the good special effects sometimes, it was not as terrible a film as I had hoped. Sure, it's good for laughs, but nowhere near PLAN 9 from outer space is it in bad shape and should not be on the worst movies list of anyone.
