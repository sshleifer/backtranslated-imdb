This film has successfully proved what we all know, that professional basketball players absorb everything besides playing basketball. Especially rap and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this film really is. First of all, am I just the mother of this ugliest child I've ever seen? I mean, his teeth can be used as a can opener. Second, why does the Genie want to practice a career in the music industry, even though he has magical powers, even though he has enormous privileges? Thirdly, I have read the Bible. No form or form mentioned that Jesus made the genes. Fourth, what is the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any nerdy teenager addicted to acne has a computer that can have better effects than that. Fifthly, why does the end suck badly? And what the hell is djin? Finally, everyone who created the nightmare known as Kazam needs to get rid of the plane and to the Eiffel Tower, because this movie takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
