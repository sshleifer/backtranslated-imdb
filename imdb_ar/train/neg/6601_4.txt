I can see why Laurel and Hardy's fans might be hurt by this fairly gentle "re-enactment", but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures. L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain are reasonably likely to acquire the duo and there is a reasonably good support team . I enjoyed it.
