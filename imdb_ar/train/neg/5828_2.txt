I could not agree more with another reviewer mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be completely boring and not inspired by "content." He can produce eye candy (and I love dessert), but its tyranny and emptiness of the underlying art diminishes all joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between Jodorowsky's similar works (but really only on the surface) or even more linear filmmakers such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love Odyssey 2001 and never did get bored through the end scenes ...) This kind of art also makes M.Barney add confusion and repel viewers who can begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Traditional "conceptual" art is empty contemporary. Check out his interviews. I just do not buy it, sorry. And very boring. <br /> <br /> I never felt bored seeing Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Restraint 9 was completely disappointing. Although they offer the potential to be something, they actually tell something in a non-linear, unconventional way (such as the beginning, the great dancing designer and the preparations for the ship to sail.) The ships "meet" on the sea ... ideas of feces as a valuable object (if the feces) These "pearl" divers ... everything can make a wonderful surreal film with some content but he did not, and those horrible false scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony ... how fake, > <br /> I have some wonderful scenes, but the whole film has become very boring, amazing and empty So he made me physically ill. <br /> <br /> He does not have a good speed, I like slow-moving films, but this was boring in some scenes - because it was tuna and fake - so I had to watch for a long time scenes from Artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> This kind of film kills art and soul t in my mind. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
