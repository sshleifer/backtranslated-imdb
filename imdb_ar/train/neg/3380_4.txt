Michael Bennett and Nicolas Dante's show has been on Broadway for years, but the evidence for his power and appeal has been lost in this film, which is likely to come from the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, away from B-way as you can get) and the main actor (Michael Douglas) Plays the role of a dance director such as the lawyer of Groi). The slender story, about an exhausting Broadway show that turns into a treatment session for singers, dancers and actors, is paid directly to us, with high-end talent playing on rafters. Nothing is modified or hidden, especially a laughable sub-plot about the return of a former dancer to the stage and Douglas's old warheads. Hope fills with ambition and pain, but their personal stories about anxiety are a bit embarrassing; this, mirrored with Attenborough's slow speed, spells of disaster, and even famous songs now fail to penetrate the artificial casing. * 1/2 of ****
