Tooth fairy revolves around the old, distorted witch's ghost that attracts children to her home for a prize for their loose sleep and then takes their lives. The first few minutes of the fairy fairy legend begin in 1949 and then move on to this day. The dreaded horror plot is largely saved through solid representation. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and some other scenes, but the scenes of injustice were bloody but swift and had a limiting effect. The eye candy is very good for both sexes. The work of the camera is good. Dialogue is fair but cheesy. I was expecting the film to be bone and budget low and bright with very few recovery factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
