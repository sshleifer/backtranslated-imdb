I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my children in the morning we left to go home, because I was full of all their toys. "My little four-year-old has found a funny scene, but he told me that what was left of him was" very ridiculous. " This is four years old, people. Anyone over the age of 9, for example, would want to kill his television instead of letting him run it himself. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is as bad as saying that the Holocaust was a simple mistake. There are no words about the absurdity of this "funny" film. The representation is bad, the plot is stupid, and the text is pathetically wrong. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the bad movie makes it worse. Bronzon Balki Pinchot is the worst with some strange fake accents (Irish Pak Bronx Kokny Kagun as far as I can tell), but all the characters are awful. I have not seen a real film for Laurel and Hardy over the ages, but I know they're better off than that. What is the purpose of destroying the classic comic duo with ... this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: the derived garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have some Bronson Pinchot fetish is terrible. 10/02
