Just Cause is one of those movies that makes you wonder at first why it came out so hard when it was released - there's nothing special but qualified enough with excellent support from Ed Harris. Then press on the last third, and everything begins to grow more and more silent until you get a killer with a flashlight tied on his forehead threatening the fillet wife Sean Connery (Kate Kappshaw is a polite and unconvincing style) and a young boy (Scarlett Johansen the little) Crocodile skinner for. <br /> <br /> This type of movies is probably the best one to see on a plane, and even once only.
