I have to agree with everyone's view that this exhibition was badly produced and written. The representation was not much higher than the low production values, but I feel that the actor can rely only on the materials provided to them and make better use of them. . In keeping with this thought, I feel it is important to point out that one actor has climbed up and moved beyond this camp to a tasteless production to become a respected and highly talented actor. I refer to Laura Harris, a born Canadian actress born on her way through many Bad productions and productions to find a place on HBO "Dead Like Me" where she plays Daisy Adir and has the credit for taking the role in an effective way. I remember a typical childhood in her childhood as a young actress during this series, playing Ashley in the seventh grade speaking in a clever tone. It felt as if anyone "made it" out of this series would certainly be Laura Harris and by its very nature she was outperforming the field representation to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her talent as well as the unique blond North Charm. If you ever have a chance to see this series, I recommend that you have something epic to watch after the wings like "Godfather" or "Beaches" in order to remind yourself that there is a great deal of real integrity of production and value there and that this series is just a budget reminder Low of what Laura Harris can simply remember from her time in the show and I bet she will quote many of the young defenders' words by saying, "It's a start!"
