This film described the garbage as unfair. At least by rooting the trash can be a sucking hobby. This veto was neither exhaustive nor enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act excellently with the opportunity, so no doubt he has an IRS bill to settle when he agrees to this terrible scenario. The story of the crazy world "The Hollow Man" has been recounted before, she was told better, and she was told without resorting to a lot of extraordinarily expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects appear to be built around transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that you can buy in the early 1970s. Was marketed in the UK as "Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", where they may have earned the title of the film. <br /> <br /> Clever special effects, terrible writing, and non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
