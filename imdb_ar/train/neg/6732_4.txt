I've discovered this film on the IFC, and I think it would be interesting. For "small" love stories, some stories have already been pulled out in this film. The fact that almost none of these women have any names makes you suspect that the actresses are talking about their true sexuality, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to start seeing some more romantic views than the first sexual encounters again, such as "Strike! (1998)", when the acquaintances of Odette Sinclair began asking about her for the first time, and asked Tweety "Was she beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some may think that reinstating the legislation and previous memories will improve this film. I think it will make things worse. It does not have to be a good pornographic to attract my attention, but somehow I expected more.
