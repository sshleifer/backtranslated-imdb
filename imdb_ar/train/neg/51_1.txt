This film was very disappointed. The relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. Some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and spirited. It was impossible to identify or even sympathize with the main characters. The character of the protagonist was as rude as she came. The dead atmosphere / greenhouse gives way to the plays. Little or nothing can be learned about the Spanish Civil War of this film. Luckily, I've been in Spain and realized that this is unreal! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as an ugly "horror" was also very offensive and poorly treated, while DVDs were assembled and advertised to attract gay viewers. The actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to get away from this mess. I think if you like to watch the children and pets you brutally kill, you may particularly like this film.
