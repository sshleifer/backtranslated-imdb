Two years ago at Sundance, Josh Cornbluth loved to guide the Haikou Tunnel for the first time. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob, the best thief in the world. This drama revolves around a good boy who apparently grew up in an area of ​​the lower class in New York. The film is not without touching moments. But sometimes it seems like Kornbluth is working in a very difficult way to illustrate what is clear: life can be very difficult for some people. Life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More accurately and more importantly, is our understanding that despite all these somewhat repulsive cultural grounds and antisocial behavior that may spawn them, these characters do not have a lack of good and humanity. We can retreat in their language and living conditions, but we can not underestimate their intentions. In fact, their struggle to preserve the family under this ordeal has a certain nobility that most of us can not appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and sympathized with the people clearly all the time. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, The Best Thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws (including the title). The characters are not very reasonable. The writing is uneven. The line of plot is barely distinguishable. For the most disturbing of all, Kornbluth uses young black boys who practice gang rap among the scenes. Each one of them: But although I do not wonder about the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see 5-year-olds talking and talking about having sex with a group of women. It's an unnecessary shock value and a bit of a borrower's attention.
