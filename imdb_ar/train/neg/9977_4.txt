This child is fairly bad, but it does not make him any kind of superior to adults and can thwart experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not very chaste, because he is a child with severe emotional problems. The gentle couple who look forward to adoption are absorbed in adopting it. While the husband is more willing to give this child an opportunity, the mother is not. Through Michael Richards' alien character Gilbert and Gottfried are always annoying and you have a fairly bad film with some laughter here and there. I actually prefer the sequel to this movie because I love the fact that they have remake Amy Yasebek again as a different character more beloved where there is one to many characters in this film which are quite improbable as they are. Even the child is somewhat annoying at first in this child, a kind of cold he gets out in the sequel as well. The plot is simple enough that with potential parents going to adopt this child who they think is gorgeous by the way that the orphanage is having a party while they leave, they quickly realize that they have little hell. In addition, this little hell comes into contact with a conviction of some kind. I'm not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. Not all this is good, but I will choose this before the Kolkin kid on any day of the week.
