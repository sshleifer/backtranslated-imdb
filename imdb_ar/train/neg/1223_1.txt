What a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code" and now "While Out". I try to come up with a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my mind during observation. I think "while abroad" was worse. <br /> <br /> All of this has been said before in other comments: unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I have to add is that at some point I started to feel more evil people than women because I had recommended them for On the Darwin Award if she already died (I just watched the first half, so I do not know). I was soon in the Darwin Awards (if possible) because of her great stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: produced by Kim Basinger? So she did not only know the text, she was also responsible for bringing this wasted money to us, people? I consider that human beings who waste large sums of money are evil because the money could have been used to feed and wear quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw him in the cinema and give 20 percent, they are stupid, which is a good chance to show how much They are stupid.
