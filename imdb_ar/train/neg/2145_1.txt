I have a question for those who have thought about this idea. why? What made them think of making a second film of this. If memory is working, Cinderella does not end with "they have all lived happily ever after"? I'm sure she did it, or was implicit. Wait a moment, if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be a supplement? Unless they are trying to make the most boring story in history, there will be no complement. I mean sure, they could have sung Cinderella for two hours, but why? The film that ends with "happily always" can not have a complement; if so they do not live happily ever after! Something must happen which causes problems at the end! why? This is not true, it is evil. This is my last word in this regard.
