This video was a masterpiece guide in 1995. Done beautifully! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston enjoy the main chemistry on the screen when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a full-version DVD with the deleted scenes and Bill Gates's commentary on how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP and more! <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 she won the Golden Globe award at least)
