This is one of the finest movies I've ever had to watch! I should have expected that, after seeing the first two, but I still see these kinds of films with the idea "Maybe they did it right this time." No - do not close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? What about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what is being transferred to SFX in this movie, a soldier fires at Raptor as he walks through a corridor. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that he is just a man with a seemingly successful tail running. Bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If this is what you can call it. There's one character, I suppose it's supposed to be from the south. However, having lived in the South for six years now, I have never heard this talk. He may have some sort of strange disability - inability to speak normally. I find it astonishing that a character does nothing to require him to have his accent - so there is no reason for the actor to try to do. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? It is essential - the Raptors' escape, the people carrying the guns must chase them. I began to wonder why dinosaurs in these films seem to always work in the nearest system of tunnels ... Do not they stay abroad to look for prey? Well, at least they have a very good feeling of appearing a bit in the film that supposedly is revolving around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - let's say you are in a building and you know that there is a man eating birds of prey running around in it. Have you decided to take some time to find an argument about who is the best - the Army or the Marines? Then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? What about the stupid idea that they have to track neighbors - split into groups of two. Have not they ever seen any horror movies (or at least a episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the stupid movies there. I miss her unless you want to delay your way to the film.
