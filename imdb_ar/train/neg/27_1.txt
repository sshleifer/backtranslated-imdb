Awesome movie. Nov Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just stuffing. The film was bad. Why should I expand on it and I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting sucks and writing a fool. Bad at all. The only nice thing in the film is the release of Deniz Akaya. So this has been ruined because of a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a piece of garbage that is not very good and completely believable. <br /> <br /> Well, I will now flop on the IMDb for this stupid rule of at least 10 lines of text. First, I spend my time watching this slaughter. Then I feel compelled to warn others, I'm creating an account with IMDb only to discover that I should write a scary article in the film just to express how bad it is. Absolutely unnecessary.
