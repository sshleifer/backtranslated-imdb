For those who are too small to know this or for those who have forgotten, Disney has left the pipes in the late 1980s. People are no longer watching their films and the company no longer produces the usual useful materials ... at least people do not expect. A big problem: bad words. <br /> <br /> Yes, the idiots who run Disney movies during that decade will make films with sworn words - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you think so - interspersed with "this family of films." Actually happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This movie, in addition to language problems, has a very bad tone, making it almost undesirable from the start. Luckily, Disney woke up and produced a lot of great stuff since these 80's movies. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under another name.)
