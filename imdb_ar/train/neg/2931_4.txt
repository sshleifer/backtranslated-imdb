The sitcom "The League of Gentlemen" follows the lives of many exotic residents in the fictional village of "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their joint setup. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a schematic display, the main plot deals with a new road to be built through Royston Vasey. Thus, more foreigners visit the small city. But Edward and Tobs, owners of the "local" shop, actually away from the city, do not like foreigners. Whenever a visitor enters his shop, he kills him. In my opinion, there are some scenes that are tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorbs engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drums, while the Tubbs dance half-naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Pauline lives in Royston Vassy. She works in a local employment center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. So when you get an interview with an unemployed man as a firefighter, she does not let him go because he is not ready for the job yet. <br /> <br /> Then there is Barbara Dickston, a transgender taxi driver, who goes pretty much details about her "sexual conversion". <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinri, always kills animals rather than treating them. In one case, he comes to the farmhouse and leads to the sitting room, where the dog puts in his basket. The farmer goes abroad. Assuming that the dog is a sick animal, Mr. Chinnery slowly dies to him. Later, the farmer opens the door, holding the patient animal "real", lamb, in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some other residents are husband and wife visited by their nephew (son) killed friend by shop owners, by the way). The couple are very well arranged. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color symbolizes one part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys marked with different colors and neatly categorized. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, actors play very well. By playing women, the scenes became comical. Fashion is suitable for actors, too. Wearing a scarf Tubbs and some crazy characters, for example Edward, her black teeth are not appetizing. The exhibition contains a lot of traditional dark and British humor. Group design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and decompose. Often there is fog around the local shop which enhances the threatened effect. Even the village sign is ominous: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors are doing a great job, this kind of serial is not my taste.
