LONDON (Reuters) - The wife of a London playwright hopes to reform the American singer and dance singer in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her modeling live in community circles. Unfortunately, the couple have already met on their own, where the girl thought that the man is actually a show product married to her boyfriend (the fact that he was not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstanding!). Eventually, the musical Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers was pulled to Earth by Dwight Taylor and Alan Scott, who is full of juvenile behavior. Not only does Astaire and Rogers have a nice meeting - they even meet ridiculously (he dances like a madman in the hotel wing above her salary and complains). Perhaps the audience in 1935 did not care how these two were meeting - as long as they did so, and happily. It seems today that the central characters have no motive to end between each other's arms: he gives them flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to stay "free of fancy" in the love section) and gives him joy. Nothing the little dance can cure! This charming duo is unrealistically unrealistic such as the London and Venice settings, but we simply see it because the fellows are Fred and Dagger. It is a fantasy for those who do not have ... those who do not mind the stupid conspiracy. Musical moments break the monotony of the supposed scenario, but fail to transcend the absurdity of the surroundings. ** from ****
