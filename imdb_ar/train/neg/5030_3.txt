What is this in heaven? Is it a plane? Is it Superman? Wrong, no? It's a turtle!?! Look, this is what became in the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans shot down a Russian fighter jet somewhere over the Arctic and the subsequent frost blast literally awakens the creature of the giant prehistoric turtle called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly creature because it immediately entails the destruction of everything and everyone walks his way. Conflicting governments finally decided to kill the ugly bastard using a new and very sophisticated snow bomb, but Gammera has another surprise at the store ?? Turtle curse can fly! The first time that this happens produces a huge and very funny sequence! Gammera lies on his back and appears subdued when the fire suddenly blows from the armpits and climbs into the air. How can you not like it? Then there's also a terrible sub-plot about a annoying child who can communicate remotely with the monster, but that's not interesting enough. Flying turtles, people! There is nothing else to write about the effort of Japanese (and re-edited) Japanese sci-fi, apart from that, it represents a clear and stark cutting operation for such classics as Godzilla and The Beast, the original of the 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and designs are very barbaric, and unlike the above films, they never succeed in creating a horrible atmosphere. Respectful actors such as Brian Dunleaf and Dicken O'Neill seem oblivious to what the film sees, and even the scenes of original Japanese chaos are not very convincing. Gammera's own song and character is fairly wonderful in nature, however, they get an extra point for it.
