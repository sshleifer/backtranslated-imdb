I usually do not spend time making comments that few people read about the films that few will see. However, in this case, I feel that I should warn all those who may be thinking of wasting time in it. I just finished watching it just five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. Representation is terrible, the plot does not exist, production values ​​are the level of poverty at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not that movie. There is only one thing that could have saved this movie for the purposes of any horror fan - more screens and pieces! The total three times that this happens is off the screen. Although it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially the end scene - there is not enough of it. The film is too long because it contains minimal content, and the dialogue is too heavy and therefore almost impossible to watch. what happened? To put everything in short with space to spare, three teenage girls are irresponsibly and knowingly driving while in an isolated area where more than 20 girls have been kidnapped and killed in the past. Their car crashes, of course, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people - one of them a psychotic killer. The three eventually killed, one by one, off the screen, after what seems like an eternal nonsense, boring slow pace. As I said, the only things worth seeing until once are homicides. Please do not buy or rent it just for that, and do not be fooled as you are by describing the art of misleading cinema and film recipe. Save your money and time.
