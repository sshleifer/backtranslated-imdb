For my life, I can not understand why they want to make a film about Jerry Springer Shaw. It's incredibly garbage. In some ways, it is regrettable that he is guilty. We all have to admit that we saw at least one episode. It is part of our popular culture. I've seen this on the USA recently. It's very bad. I will admit it. Jerry does a terrible job than I thought he meant acting. Or something like that. Jimmy Presley is in it. It basically plays itself. All you need is her beloved son, Kid Rock. It was perfect after that. Therefore, I recommend skipping the "ringmaster". Just watch "Jerry Springer Watch". It's more fun than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
