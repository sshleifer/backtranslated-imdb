Never consider watching this unfortunate excuse for a movie. The way it is shot, lighting, disposition, etc. it has no meaning. All this is very bad and difficult to watch. Repeated amounts of footage are beyond boredom. There seems to be no "normal" person in the entire film, and the existence of the "outside world", well, it does not exist. Why did this bald man suddenly become invincible? This film is beyond stupidity. zero.
