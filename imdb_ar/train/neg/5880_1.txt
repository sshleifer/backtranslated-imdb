The film starts slowly when we got to the cinema, we thought it looked very good, but after about 5 minutes we felt bored from our minds and wondered about the kind of movie we saw and I do not like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone, it was the best part of the night when the alarm clock And the lights because the project was interrupted because we thought we could all go home. This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen, we've felt bored or minds, and most people in the cinema really ran out of doors in the end because it was too bullshit. I was surprised that no one came out early on. If you go and see it, make sure you keep you busy, and better yet, do not go there at all.
