It has been almost 14 years since Sharon Stone gave viewers a thousand legions to cross the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, are in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is a sequel to the "Basic Instinct" that features an exciting stone and a weak Michael Douglas. However, the original game lovers may not approach this film, because "Instinct 2" is painful, because the average director Michael Caton-Jones assassinates the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The plot begins when a car explodes at first.

The "instinct" is convincing torture. <br /> <br /> For the first time, nothing was found that made the original film guilty of guilt anywhere in the film. Sharon Morris plays a role in his worst role in his life, and seems to never make more than two expressions in the film confused and confusing. "Instinct 2" is a horrific way to continue the original series Other than that, which has succeeded in developing excitement with erotica very well ... Paul Verhoeven, How I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Core Instinct 2" has never been like a good movie, and it really is not. Some movies should not come out of paper, and that's how you feel after watching it. Now, it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg withdrew, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge salary for this ......
