Well, I love most people, they give me free tickets and I go to see most things, and now the multichannel cinemas are very good (I remember the old movie theaters with the single screen "Flea Pit" and I'm the health side of 40). In England this film was released as a "liar," a dog. Is a complete waste of good cellulite. 4/10 for photographer and set only.
