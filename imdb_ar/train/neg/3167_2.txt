Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his fiancee, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking into last minute arrangements to receive them. It is the morning of their wedding, and Kate is in a state of agitation, giving restaurants a lot of attention on her demands for food. But, horror horror, carved ice "Angel", ordered by Kate, arrived without wings. In the next battle with the sculptor, the pristine "icy" heavy rests on Kate and sends her to the Hereafter. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges for a psychiatrist to tell the young veterinarian that Kate wanted him to start dating other women and move on. However, the beautiful means, Ashley (Lake Bill) interested in Henry herself, which angers her partner in the provision of food (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to subvert Ashley, because she does not intend to let another woman put her hands on Henry. Can you do anything to bring Kate back to paradise forever? This is a very bad romantic comedy, one of the worst of these dedicated fans at all. No, it's not the team, where they try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as her fianc√© Bill and Bill have an odd style and a similarly infectious humor. Biggs, thespian funny, too, totally wasted. As for Rod, the highly talented performer (see Ankurman, Knockid Abb, or Clois, please), he is doing his best, and is in fact the main reason for seeing this hideout. His charm, appearance, and easy intelligence cut a long way in making the film possible. But, nothing can turn an eccentric text and a terrible trend into a winner, and nothing at all. So, if you love romance romance, think long and hard before you outperform this money. Even if the free tickets fall on your lap, be careful that this film is a near death experience for those who love the cinema of love and laughter.
