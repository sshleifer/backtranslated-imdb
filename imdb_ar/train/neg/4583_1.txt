If you want to see a clever philosophical debate about human potentials, see "Waking Life," which is great. "What is # $ *! Do you know?" Everywhere in his concentration, poor guidance, bad writing, badly behaved, completely devoid of any artistic direction and completely annoying. It was not thought-provoking or amusing at the slightest. The inclusion of this obsessed "narrator" in this film is sufficient reason to avoid this. Is not it strange how filmmakers choose to look at the fact that this woman worships a 2,000-year-old Atlantic god or something like that? What a rattling old chick, and how wasting my time and money this film. People responsible for this movie should not be allowed to produce another film again.
