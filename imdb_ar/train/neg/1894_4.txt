Although Fill Guillotines exists as part of the title of this film, it has nothing to do with the original Fill Guillotines (1975) and is followed by Flying Guillotines II (1978). The originals are masterpieces of Kung Fu and still stand out as classic. This is a lesser version of the original version, and even with being an ordinary Kung Fu film, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie does not have much representation. It is a meaningless combat scene, and the airplane guillotine does not play a major role in it. The story revolves around some Shaolin monks who track some of the bad guys who took off a holy book, and the evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the conspiracy. The wicked prince himself plans to seduce the monks and use the flying guillotine on them. <br /> <br /> There are four films with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. This in my opinion is less quality. The guillotine design in this film differs from the other three, which indicate that this film was produced by a different entity from the other three. <br /> <br /> The film does not contain a chemistry except unintentionally funny double production. <br /> <br /> Best skip this and watch the original.
