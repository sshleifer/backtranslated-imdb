It is certainly one of the worst films produced and released by Hollywood's main studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in cliches. You can complete a large number of sentences in the script because of this. The acting is very bad, especially that Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is absurd and completely incomplete. One can only pity the reviewer who saw Yvonne's 23-year-old dance as sexual. It's just a very bad dances design. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you're working in bad movies and have fun on some turkeys in Hollywood, that's right for you. I purchased the color version on VHS, making the film worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. It is the best part of this film. What is the way to launch a career.
