This was a terrible God. The story was everywhere, and more often than not I was confused by the terrible liberation. I did not feel any sympathy for anyone because their personalities did not develop enough. They were very superficial people yet. Cheesy stereotypes, with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, even if it was nice-looking. I do not know what he was trying to be, but how shocked I was when they showed this trash on Sunday? I've almost canceled my subscription. You thought such a channel would show better quality movies. There are many, much better gay and lesbian films under there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I totally enjoyed the "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who left my mind right now, but what I'm trying to say is that this was not worth it. If you watch it on TV, okay, but do not worry. <br /> <br /> There may have been three or four shots that look really nice (sadly I can rely on them on the one hand), otherwise a movie was a pretty crappy as well. Lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add to something that had nothing practical. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Ripple is too hot (without blond hair of course). Too bad he did not act acting for me. Stick with real porn, friends. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
