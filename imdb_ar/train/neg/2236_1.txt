I do not really know where to start. The acting in this film was really horrible, and I can not remember seeing so many "actors" in a single film that could not act. The acting was not only bad, but the characters were also stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's the procedure. I think even children know that when someone is shot, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot at Snitch'd for ten (!!), there is no blood at all. Well, I think this is just me. <br /> <br /> To make a short story long (because believe me, I can continue for hours on this film), this is by far the worst film I have ever seen. This movie must be the number 1 100 percent without a doubt.
