Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "B-movie" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good summary of this film? Take the aliens, replace the vampire xenomorphs, then remove everything that was good on it, and this is pretty much. <br /> <br /> After 5 minutes of the movie, "V-SAN Band" (this is the dumbest abbreviation I have ever heard) verifies the "rule" slaughtered by vampires and then climbs (down? what?) A clearly hanging ladder with an ad board with a present train present in the background. When is this supposed to happen? 2210. Well ... (Wait, I'll go back to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. Characters. Wow, well, there is an Asian tertiary symbolic herd, the retired cowboy herd, the escaped captain, the gothic vampire / hot tub, and the part-time treasurer. All of them were played by their representatives with the same lack of ambition. I have come to see Michelle Ironside in this way. Does not he get enough money to be Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter's cell? By and large, the only original thing about Vampire Wars is how damaging it is. <br /> <br /> By watching this post-film period, the only entertainment she got was the weak attempts at making films. How long have PCI cards been recorded on the wall as a ready room in a spacecraft? The money needed to make this film could have been used better.
