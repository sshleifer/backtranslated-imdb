I'm sorry, but even Adrian Zmid of TJ Hoeker could not keep this sequel. I passed half the film believing that this was a parody of the original. Then came the mysterious motorcycle scene (note that this was the only film directed by Patricia Birch); and I realized sadly that they were trying to be serious. I got a kick from the fact that the opposition band, having lost "wheels" because of their original gambling habits, had to use motorcycles in the second film. Since I'm ashamed of the Carzing Boots personality, I hate to see what they're turning to later: maybe the bikes? <br /> <br /> Nor did I ever buy the idea that was dispensed with: the evil Australian boy. Suit the outsiders dominated by the school - Ergo - Google with Google - biker - helmet appearance. Disney's story was horribly improvised. <br /> <br /> So, you seem to be able to destroy something well by putting bubble gum on Michel Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took from this film was the idea of ​​how many points out of ten to give it.
