One is the highest rating I could have given this movie, given zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Piss, a meaningless mess for a movie with a lot of B-listers who missed a better job, written and directed by someone with a twelve-year-old mentality who smiles and laughs at stupid idiot, pipe jokes and a tape. For example, the character of Ding-Bat of All in the Family, who tells Marilu Henner that she is "bouncing in both directions" through sexual contact, was a cheap attempt at humor that indicates the general awkwardness of the film ... you want well , Cheeky humor? Animal Rental House, American Pie (only one part), old school or office space.
