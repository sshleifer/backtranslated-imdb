Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their captain - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own fight (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And uniforms and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and they have been recruited after wishing them to be heroes and playing in that game. They also live a normal life, have family duties and a school, but most of the activities take place away from the bad guys who fight in schools. The bad guys all have unique and unique features, such as Mister Vague and his men who never know what their plans are but behave anyway. From the wicked robot to the evil Baron, the three must confront them and stop their evil, often strange, planning to gain power and revenge and so on. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is nice and very smooth, but the style seems to be simple and intentional. The backgrounds have overlapping color and buildings look futuristic. The music is quite beautiful, and the presentation is not quite quite bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plots are almost irrational and absurd, but after all this is a cartoon and can not be blamed. But this will not be in the same rank as Fillmore! Or pepper an.
