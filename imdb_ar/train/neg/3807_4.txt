Do not get me, I'm a fan of many Woody movies, and it's clear that the masterpieces of his late 70s (Annie Hall, Interior Design, and Manhattan) and most of his dramas in the late 1980s / early 1990s (Hannah, Crimes, Misdemeanors, I liked some of his more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks) but that was sad, although I could not have been worse than Match Match last year but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It was lazily planned - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes that were removed - Woody seems to be on his way out as well, slowing down most of his lines And to make the words "hilarious" I mean with all due respect ... "Again and again all these things become futile. <br /> <br /> I know that most actors queue up to work with him, but they must at least read The first text - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman is much better than that - and Woody must really take a bigger role behind the role of the camera in the future, if he has any sense of about 20 miles Behind him. <br /> <br /> It would not be too tragic if we did not have a lot of wonderful Woody movies compare this to B - but obviously his best days are behind him and judged in this effort, Woody should call it a day before It becomes a joke in the industry. <br /> <br /> It is awkwardly embarrassing
