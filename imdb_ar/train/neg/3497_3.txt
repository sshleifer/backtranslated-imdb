Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this offer is not complete at all. Personality is not likable remotely, and it is not a position in which you think, "Oh, I love it" only "It's like that." This character is just an old good person, a bar, meaning that Sarah is struggling to carry this show because she is almost the only one that is ridiculous in it. The mood, the dialogue is all boring and dry, she listens to your grandfather and continues about the marble he collected as a child. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman's program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking of changing the channel to see the old repetition of the married with the children. Something funny because the characters are "immoral" and "impolite". I'm sorry but I do not find an offer full of dry humor and wheat on the lines of the wall story about some angry and bitter life and losing bitter with her annoying as a hell sister and gay friends who looks like Keanu Reeves with cold anywhere nearby funny. I can not stand with this offer, although I find Sarah Silverman in general "loved her because she is such a character" as School of Rock, most of which stands. I think this presentation is boring with characters that you think mean and say and do things for the value of shock for example. The hard cube has diarrhea and words that generally strike for laughter. Sarah Silverman's program tries to be funny and fails to need either a laughable track or a better book. Someone compared it to South Park but not soon. I have expressed opinions about the Sarah Silverman program and will not become an annoying rogue, which means that you will not always see me and publish things such as "This offer sucks" and "Why not cancel this yet". Such as the Sarah Silverman program if you enjoy.
