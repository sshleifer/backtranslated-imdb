I have read all the comments on this film. I am a big fan of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this film was based <br /> <br />. The film is fictional, ugly and deplorable. I'm not criticizing it because <br /> <br /> changing small details or events for dramatic purposes; it <br /> <br /> is not a documentary. But the script changes the effects and reaction, <br /> <br />, and changes in each key character. Drastically alter <br /> <br /> The true relationship between Harrar and young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the absurd rivalry of Tibetan women (who spoil the Tibetan culture) to the Harra Music Box gift, to Harrar's <br /> <br /> heart, all about this movie Wrong - except <br /> <br /> for stunning photography. I understand that footage <br /> <br /> Potala (palace) was smuggled from Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> changing a true story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one is very important to this world, to build <br /> <br /> the movie star sad
