Unfortunately it was misleading. This film stuns from start to finish. It was hard to see me because I was watching Clarissa explain it every day on Nickelodeon. I loved her. Then the next thing I found was that they spread out in Maxim and were fantastic! I did not hear anything about her until I saw this film by chance. I could not believe she would let something like that appear in her name everywhere. Everything was wrong, but it looked like someone somewhere in the team was really trying to save a soaked ship. Very bad .. I hope to continue acting and would like to see her with real actors in a real film.
