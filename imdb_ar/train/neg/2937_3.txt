Crossover's attempt to attract those who do not appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singer of all time, but failed badly. All that is desirable in this film is opera, one can find the best recording of Pavarotti doing what he does better. The plot is about a love story with a doctor who is healing his throat, which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /> <br /> Just because it has been put forward for a long time, it is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a musical presence far from his musical talent. This opinion does not negate anything he does in this film. His sin lies in not rejecting the heinous text. Perhaps because the great opera can have silly stories, bear this story. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and vulgar. This movie is like walking through the cold mud to capture some of the most dramatic stories (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just get one of the many wonderful opera recordings or audio concert and get to know Mr. Tenor where it is most convenient. <br /> <br /> It will be one of the 100 worst films for IMDb if more people remember it and give it some votes. Will be appropriate in a list that includes many of the efforts of singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through the film. Often everything is wrong wrong because of inefficient representation or terrible scenario. Pavarotti was a good actor if he did not show such a wonderful sound. Despite his effectiveness as an actor (opera requires it), Jimmy Stewart could not have saved Turkey from a script. <br /> <br /> Give it a polite 3 out of 10 because someone might be a fan of Pavarotti singing and opera because of this movie.
