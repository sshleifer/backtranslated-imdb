Oh, CGI. Nima when used properly. Sin in use by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is being used badly in this lavish jawpiece. <br /> <br /> Well, anyone who reads any of my published reviews may notice two things. 1: I love low budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a nice guy in a low budget movie, I'll usually refer to them. So, let's get out of this way now. This is a horror movie with a low budget I did not like. Representation, for the most part, is terrible, and funny for the effects, and rival the Battlefield Earth scenario as the worst I have seen this year. As much as the gentle resident boy ... Dax Miller wins this award. This boy is hot! Surprisingly, he is not just a toned body with nice eyes and a nice obstacle ... he can actually act (as well as he can in this hateful film). Now that housekeeping has become far-fetched, let's continue. <br /> <br /> In Cliff Notes, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to give up anything) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers (A nice boy and has friends) who surf with sharks. They are not known to have a fairly large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Crocodile shows up, cries out chaos, and people eat. End of roll credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie was pretty much hit. It started well, but soon turned out to be silly and stupid. The main character becomes lunch (in a rather comical way), and our remaining heroes speak with one side at the expense of the victims. Also, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain on the ground and in the water, what is all the surrounding sharks? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think some shark sharks will wrap around it. The Forex market is one of the worst things I've ever felt dissatisfied with. The CGI is awesome, and they even managed to decipher animated crocodiles. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Shop. The Crocodile Hunter. They know the shape of alligators. You obviously did not refer to any of these provisions through the monsters you see near the end of the film. And what is with the pirate gang / drug pusher? Do you need just another reason to break a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get a few sub-species in the film world. With Alligator and its accessories, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now appears that the alligator films are now large and must now have their own class in Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. So I thought the Crocodile Tobe Hooper was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My estimate: D-
