Take: <br /> <br /> 1. A famous play <br /> <br /> 2. The director now has his own ideas that use <br /> <br /> 3. Copy of the theater design of the popular theater production of The play mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. A representative of the leadership - he has no sense of the role he plays and you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" <br /> <br /> I listened to the radio play for "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell and Hamlet I was very disappointed. I hoped the picture would be better, and Shell had at least a physical language to emphasize what he was saying - nothing. Then the group ... The simple design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like it when there's enough on the stage to explain what the setting is and nothing more. Unfortunately, this is on stage, in the theater. It will not work in a movie that depends on a play that already has believable settings. The idea of ​​the group was copied from the theatrical production in which Schell played the role of Hamlet already ... Let's say if this is the only thing I should grumble about ... Ask myself how Chill could get a part of Hamlet anywhere in the beginning place And how anyone can allow him to play Hamlet for the second time. If you have the option to watch any of the 60 Hamlet-based movies, do not watch this movie, unless you're really masochist or hardcore, or you'd like to ridicule talented actors.
