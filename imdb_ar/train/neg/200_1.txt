The reviewers were impressed by this film and surprised me. The plot is a mess. Wooden characters. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on and disrespecting other characters. No one has any replacement quality or point of interest. This is not an exciting job it's not a fantasy. It's not a paradox. It's not smart. There is nothing straight forward about this hard work. That missed the launch of the play is not a surprise. That "this network" broadcasts that it reduces this place. I would definitely recommend moving to the Garden Smart program on PBS or even good information if you encounter this mess on TV late at night. If you experience it on TV during the day, take a long distance. Even if you are walking in foggy smoke, you will feel better than not being exposed to this crisis. Life is short. This film is long
