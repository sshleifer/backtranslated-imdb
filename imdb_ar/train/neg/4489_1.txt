The "Matrix" of the thrilling summer films that were visually stunning but also curious was a "Twilight" provocation. The general rule applies here, and this string does not match its predecessor. Worse, it is not comparable to it. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded" explodes on the screen in the most professional fashion. In the first few seconds, the first impression is generally good where the Trinity is portrayed in a dream. Immediately afterwards, the nose diving film. After the first 45 catastrophic minutes, momentum is gradually gaining momentum as it enters the matrix and the Battle of Agent Smith takes place. But he loses himself very quickly when he reaches the sequence of chasing cars for 14 minutes and it gets worse in a big development eventually owed. Worst of all is the sight of "Raven Zion" protracted. It's not just about the scheme, it's also a pathetic excuse for the discovered pornographic and dance music. <br /> <br /> The amazing side of the "matrix" was a good addition, but the "reload" it over-made it look boring. In the first stage, there were interesting plot roles, but from the very linear to be interesting remotely. The film is basically just a series of elegant transformations that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on an incorrect principle that the bigger is the better. The "matrix" privilege seems to have descended quickly to the wrong special effects that other franchises like the Star Wars epic have. <br /> <br /> The criterion of representation is weak for the most part. The best character of course goes to "Smith's agent" with Hugo Weaving, the only person who is slightly interested. Keanu Reeves is the final Neo, but in all special effects, there is little room for significant impact. Laurence Fishburne, an Oscar nominee, is chosen as a stylized teacher with poor dialogue. Part of Carrie Anne Moss, where it would have been possible to do a better movement chore by any other actress. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded Matrix" is a bad and disappointing film. Those who did not like them are unlikely to flow. This one is for lovers just die. Even in your sub genre of the film of bonanzas special effects (minority report, matrix etc.), this is still fairly bad. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10.
