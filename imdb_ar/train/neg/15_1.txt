that's it. This is. This is the worst film ever. Start. Everything beats. I have never seen worse. Retrieve the cup and give it to these people ..... There is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even after three days of watching this (for some reason I still do not know why) I can not believe how terrifying this movie / it was. it's so bad. Away from anything that can be considered a film, a story or anything that was supposed to be created and introduced into our existence. <br /> <br /> This made me wonder if humans had really placed on this earth or not. I do well. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and progress as a species in the universe. This kind of film really hurts us as a society. We must be ashamed. I can not really stress that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of such gross distortions in our reality for our own benefit. It is an embarrassment. I do not know how any of these actors, the writers or the director of this film sleeps at night and they know that they have a role in "loading". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters you enjoy watching these kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> However, I like a good bad film. I love the 3 shark attack, and I love the bad taste, they are great. Tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this crosses a "bad" line into a completely new dimension. This is embarrassing. This is bad where you know everything will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence before it occurs; not exactly like a second or two before, I mean like, after watching the first five minutes before. <br /> <br /> The "effect" of the embryonic adjustment is used repeatedly to a satisfactory point. I really do not want to see the effect of "brittle" camera "drug buzz" or jumps cuts or cuts in deviation or any FANCY cut ever again. This is very boring and repeated and only torments the public. <br /> <br /> But let me be specific here, the most striking feature of this film is that, given the production, it appears that a fairly adequate amount of money has been placed in this stool. I personally will grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him to demand that he run to the house and swallow two gallons of Drain-O or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever need a new form of inhumane torture of prisoners of war abroad, just show this movie in a padded cell again and again. Believe me, I think they will become more extravagant in suicidal methods after 72 days to sit down. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the most cruel aspects of our society. Please. Stop. right Now.
