I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series will recognize responsibility. The script is very unfamiliar, where someone must have written a failed admission exam in the Union of Canadian Comedy Books (that's what something says!). Get out of your sight if you want, but there's nothing like a joke on the horizon. Rooney Corbett must have been broken to break himself with this garbage. The rest of the actors lack any kind of acting or comedy ability. I was amazed that they continued after the first episode - correction, after the tests. All I can say to those who enjoy it is that they should enjoy it easily. Obviously production costs must be 100 â‚¤ per loop. If anyone thinks I am a foreigner who does not know English humor, I must add that I am already English.
