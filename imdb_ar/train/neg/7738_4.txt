The movie was OK. Not bad, not good, just OK. If there is anything else in the theater, this will be greatly skipped. Unfortunately, fast and furious 2 also stunk, but I prefer seeing this from FF2. :) If you have a fetish from Harrison Ford or that other little villain, this will be a nice movie for you. Personally, I was waiting for HBO or Blockbuster.
