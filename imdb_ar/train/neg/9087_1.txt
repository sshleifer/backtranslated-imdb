The Canadians are so polite that they are not insignificant but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the Gamba theater as they classify this film 0 or 1 on their ballot papers. The premise is that a modern film director explains the story of the seventeenth century about pastors and shepherds in the distant past when Druids were spiritual leaders. The work of the three-era represents many opportunities to offer historical paradoxes including absurd and impractical clothing and exotic spiritual rituals involving really bad poetry. Lovers are divided with jealousy and strict adherence to the stupid rules of behavior that arise from the sporadic and varied comic positions. The film could have been Farhanna as a piece of Monty Python, which closely resembles it, but Rohmer's efforts were very flat. The audience laughed at the jokes in front of everyone, but they were surprised at the slow pace. The end comes in a hurry and really terrible. This is a trivial film and a waste of time for your movie.
