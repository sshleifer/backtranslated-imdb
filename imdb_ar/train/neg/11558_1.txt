An unusually appalling story that I can barely put in. The best part of the film was when a victim of the murder finally appeared, alive and well, to be slaughtered again. There is a chance to miss some basic drawing elements because I may be in a trance coma during this child's existence. The box in the movie shows scenes that never appear in the movie. I was attracted by the loose images of torture and bondage and the promises of "shake a European, flick the horror". I felt that this was the budget issue and left about a quarter of the film. All the good things are more likely. I got PG-13, which was as logical as the end of the new Planet of the Apes. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
