The camera is working - why is the camera working in this movie very fixed? This is annoying and distracting. Editing - The still image flashes were too short. Many other scenes were also very short. It just blinks. Sound - The background music was high sound and covered the sounds. One should not translate and react to what has been said. No one checks these things and makes them do it again. Please reduce background music volume in the future. Does modulation of relative sound levels is the function of editor Julia Wong? The plot was way too much loose ends. The basic story line was possible. I think the film needs more work. Have you rushed? Maybe the money ran out. Like so many movies, it started out as fantastic but eventually faded away. I do not really understand this, you know that you have a storyboard before you start production, so why not all loose parties are handled in the work board. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be too embarrassed.
