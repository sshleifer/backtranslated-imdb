This was a really interesting film. The presentations are third class, and the dialogue is so confused that at times it looks like it's just finished and died. A simple rental reason: searching for a movie with text writing. I needed visual help for the presentation, so I figured out why I was not using a clip? The boy was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came to this, where it was dubbed "Starstruck" suspiciously. I thought, "Hey hey," and decided to try it. Well, I was not very satisfied with my results. There may have been one scene I could use, and at the same time, I was practically asleep because of the outbreak of the flick. So ..... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Then again, it would be nothing great compared to the "Starfucker" drive.
