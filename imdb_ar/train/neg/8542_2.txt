Working on my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack and The Witches' MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas) is similar to the seventeenth movie in the group. <br /> <br /> The movie did not have anything to catch my attention at all. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue seemed impassive. The representation was poor. The characters were not sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is to start, with an angry woman pushing her to burn her daughter who looks cruel. However, the only connection that connects this scene to the rest of the film, is the leading figure, Mario, who has the most wonderful mustache at all. But, that's it. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was very intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some of the scenes were almost completely black. It's barely watchable - what can I say more?
