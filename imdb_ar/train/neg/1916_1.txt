This film is completely garbage. Some morbid intellectuals comfort themselves by doing their best to demand the supremacy of the aristocracy over the working class. Nothing more than a piece of self-effacement. disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this type of film is set in the United States, it certainly will make itself a big joke. Simply because it comes out of the "other side", it makes itself a wonderful masterpiece, and a wonderful entertainment for some Westerners who brainwash and / or brainwash (probably George W. :). The aftermath of the Cold War is typical, a kind of humor anyway. <br /> <br /> I would like to say, if this - as expressed in this film - is all the Soviet thinkers have been thinking about all these years, then perhaps they deserve all the hardships they claim to have gone through. but not! Because like so many others, I read and saw real masterpieces made by real Soviet intellectuals. For example, there is something to do with dogs, "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky and Stanislav Rostotsky - a real masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sadness, pride and true dignity, one of the best in the Soviet era.
