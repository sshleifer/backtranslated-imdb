I really wanted to love this movie and watched it all the way by thinking it was getting better. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst bout at all, but it does not live up to its potential. The premise is good, the cast is awesome (I've specifically pumped to see David Newton's return) and, God willing, you can tell everyone that they did their best. It's just a failure again and again. The "brutal carnage" should be a constant reminder to the filmmakers that Christopher Just is the only one who can do Christopher Christopher's movies, and despite the fact that it makes it seem easy, you might forget just trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are great at this, and you have to see them a lot ... they're the reason I got 4 stars from me. If you get a "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suspect you might want the man who made "Spinal Tap" to direct the order ... just think out loud there.
