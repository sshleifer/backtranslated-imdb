I watched this film in a pre-publication show at the Beverly Hills Book Guild Theater. As I recall, the producers and directors in the film were present and supposed to measure our reactions. <br /> <br /> Many scenes have raised a tale of laughter from the audience, which would have been good if it were a comedy, it was supposed to be a horror film. <br /> <br /> If the audience is not afraid, the filmmakers seem to have been. They have delayed their release for over a year. Out of curiosity, I saw him again to see if they would re-cut; as far as I can tell, they did not. It was the same bad film, just one year old. <br /> <br /> He is almost qualified as "very bad, he is good", but slow and slow.
