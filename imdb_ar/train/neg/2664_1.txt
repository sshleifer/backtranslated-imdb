The disgusting thriller, featuring a young couple conducting cross-country research on America's most famous killing sites, is becoming a partner on the road with a young woman of Azera and her young friend - a real psychic. The tone of the film harmonizes elegance, ridiculous irony and absurd ambiguity. Maybe hand-made, but in the end funny. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-rent killer is a lovable performance. * from ****
