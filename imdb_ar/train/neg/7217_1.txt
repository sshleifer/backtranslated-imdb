I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerners, so my husband hired them. He began apologizing to me halfway. Saddles, costumes and accents - everything was outside. The part that made me crazy is that the guy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow while he was taking the fat guy's spirit. His only excuse was "there are only two left." We've seen it all along, and as someone else has said ... a lot of bad things to explain any one reason to suck it. I mean, the fact that the boy took the stone of evil from the synagogue in the same month and the day in which he was found, what is the purpose of that? Why was there a tomb yard where everyone died on April 25, but people who took over the souls by the mosque still roam? If you want to make fun of some movie beer, this may be the movie. However, if you want a real Western, you will hate this movie.
