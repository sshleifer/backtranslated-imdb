Sure, we all love bad movies at one time or another, and we actually enjoy them, but this was not a pleasure to be guilty, it was just nonsense. Someone, vince, was cocky enough to make himself the main character while he might be drunk / high - perhaps both - and thought it was a great idea to produce a movie. Then go to show his script equal / drunk individuals. Overall, this film was so bad, predictable, and non-original I could not get 20 minutes from it before I turned it off. Makes you got served looked like a Ken Citizen. Batman? WTF ... Some guy who walks around with bat, real original. Almost as well as its name Fat Man, and the presence of a fat man walking around in supernatural clothing.
