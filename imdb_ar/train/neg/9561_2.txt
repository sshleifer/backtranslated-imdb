As many others have commented before me here, I must say that this film is bad, but it is not the worst I have ever seen. There will be no direct references to movie charts or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I felt like I was watching a TV episode or something, they got a comment on some extra dollars that I spent on the CGI (I saw worse) ... Overall, it's an insult to the viewer, At least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology at all. There are so many moments of humiliation that make me feel comfortable, and I find myself begging that all this - quickly - ends halfway. In addition, there are countless "easy way out" scenarios, which are also an insult to your intelligence as a human thought ... <br /> <br /> This movie completely fades compared to the old "Wargames", and I think it's a shame that They describe it as a complement. <br /> <br /> Two of me, because of one thing and one thing only: Performance of actors is not bad, the crap of the script they had to work with. However, they should not sign in to this movie. Not really a professional movement, but I think we all have bills we pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are awarded the highest score for this movie ... you'll be on the studio's payroll or something, the only illustration. <br /> <br /> For all who have not seen this one: by all means, watch it and take your own mind. But lower your expectations to the ground (then some).
