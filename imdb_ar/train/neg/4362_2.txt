A group of foreigners looking for humans and going to earth to eat on the ground that crashed on a planet of prehistoric monsters instead, where they all eat physiological mushrooms and are late for work. This film full of "Dinosaur Planet" movies and horrible jokes is definitely something that can not be missed. Acting is also terrible, and although this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (which movie can it be?) These things are still very repugnant. It's about 90 minutes as if it's eternal, and you're likely to be cursed for life. So you have a great interest to continue, skip this crazy movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to resell the faeces as MST3K makes fun of the film they made a decade ago. It works to some extent. It is still not saturated, although Ariona Albright is spicy, but Lilith Stubbs Enjoy a very unattractive speaker voice. <br /> <br /> My appreciation: D- <br /> <br /> DVD additions: Joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes in black features; Jessica Mills original photo gallery
