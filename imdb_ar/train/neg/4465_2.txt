After the great success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread like a disease in a world of horror films growing in grief. The result is all in films like El Segundo Nombre, a TV-like production, a bad book, but it behaves worse. I did not read Ramsay Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll Who ate his mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you are looking for a quiet and quiet night in a new movie theater. 10/02
