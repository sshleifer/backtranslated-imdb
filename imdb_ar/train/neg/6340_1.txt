This is the kind of film that I've most feared. He is arrogant and irresponsible, offering a blueprint for the vulgar Colombian conflict, an insult to all the Colombian people. The performances are the godawul, from Grisales (her very nastily nude scene), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks directly from Tim Burton's nightmare), to DÃ­az, who makes a remarkable effort to recreate life to a distinctive character - dimensional, vulgar and poorly written What remains to work with is a mustache. Not to mention the unwarranted endings, the Gore Cheese Festival so much that it will make Ed Wood cringe. In all aspects, cinema, artistic direction, fashion, make-up, editing, and most of all, Jorge Ali Triana was always a poor filmmaker but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, but I hope that Colombian filmmakers will learn a lesson about the honesty, integrity and responsibility of this intended failure.
