This is available on "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Dark Films, and since I've just finished "Barracuda", I've seen it too. This film proves to be very ambitious and incompetent at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young girls walking in the streets of a foreign town, but where exactly are they? They stopped looking at the necklaces of some Chinese vendors and tried to wear Chinese-style clothes in a shop, but then we see some dancers from Aztec? All the time, these girls are followed by two young men who eventually shoot down anything unwanted to chase them on a land trip despite the town, and finally they were caught. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a piece of metal on her neck, and these guys want to find the stolen, and where did she get it? So, in the flashback, we come back to see it. How did they know they had a coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were going out with their sisters and friends to their sister on board a boat, and after stopping to get air in their tanks, they pulled this young boy to the pier His house, only to go out his grandfather calls "young" to herbal tea with grandmother. But not everyone has tea, Todd has come back to the boat to inspect the little girls, and when they fall away, the boat blows up, and when they return home their friends mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems as if these "nice people" are raising their own vegetables, but waiting for the meat to slip down to work and serve herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls want to leave an island, but now, they are returning, accompanied by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one has seen the girls where he was before. It also seems that there is another person on the island, thugs begin to mystery in death, one by one, and because there are only three, does not take long. And even there is a kind of happy ending, which will leave the viewer perplexed as often as in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> It seems that thugs are the speed of freaks with anger issues, and combined with the inability to represent they are hilarious borders. The Hills family is devoid of acting ability, although the grandfather is Hank Warden, who has appeared in numerous films and television shows. The procedure is confusing, the languages ​​more disjointed, and the island resembles Southern California. <br /> <br /> So, what the hell? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very strange.
