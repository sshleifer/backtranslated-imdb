There is only one essential thing for a comprehensive appreciation of Indian hostility. Unscrew your panties. Peek inside. Is there evidence of Y chromosome? Well, you have to do this. <br /> <br /> This movie contains all the requirements of men: blood, guns, car chases, generators, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, fireworks - what have I got out of? - Oh, yeah, flashlights. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I very much hope that Ben Shawn will see this as "an effort when I was a child ...". Since everyone wrote and brought out the thing, it is almost entirely responsible. Inequality actors (Viggo Mortensen, as usual, try to show brilliantly how the task is supposed to be) save Penn. Too late. Lines and work there. Even the faithful and the skilled representatives can not change those things. <br /> <br /> I found this film childish and silly, and also predictable. Dialogue Stumbles - Sandy Dennis respects the attempts to bring life to the monologue of wooden mothers without the originality of the mother. Then she died. Soon, he is the father of the champions of the tournament, played by Charles Brunson. Its absence is difficult to note. <br /> <br /> At intervals, fireworks, etc., seem to be stirring things up and intimidating the public to think of something important. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under the age of 25, you may love this movie. He plans to return to her at the age of 35. Do you think you still love her? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
