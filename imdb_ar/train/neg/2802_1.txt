I think if you go to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and ask the basic English group to prepare a text, it would make more sense. After that, I could go to the drama group in the first year and they would act better than the boys in this film. These sounds really mean, but I'm sure they made this joke and fully realized they possessed (see what I did there?) No skills to act or write anything at all. <br /> <br /> See this only if you are incredibly drunk or high or need a good excuse for finding your decomposing body in the cleft joints. I will now go to the fish bowl and collect all the feces at the bottom. After that, I will form it as a disc and place it in my DVD player, fully expecting to produce something much better than this game. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breast - 9/10
