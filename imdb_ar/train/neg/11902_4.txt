The hysterical thing in this film is that according to the director, he finds it difficult to find a distributor in the United States because most of them who have seen him have not been able to reconcile apparently conflicting messages of Christianity and American anxiety. The idea of ​​anyone seeing this as a religious film in any case is laughable. <br /> <br /> Because a minister on a mission to pray with the displaced or wish someone "conciliation" makes him a "Christian" film? One can explain that in fact he makes fun of religion in the "Plenty Land" with all his material surplus, and the best the organization can do is distribute a bowl of soup and a verse of the Bible. Too much pity or perhaps oppressed? Lots of useless homeless tasks? What about a lot of Vietnam psychiatrists psychological? As an imaginary survivor of the "pink" agents, do we think that America is the "land of plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Certainly we do not have many people interested in Palestinian politics based on the phone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you work in a shelter for homeless people in Germany, it is unfortunate that there is greater concern about peace in a land far from their own survival because the world knows how Europe is a "continent of plenty" when it comes to development. <br /> <br /> In fact, I finally agreed to the title because the United States is "land of plenty" and in this particular case, refers to the abundance of lousy scripts, amateurs who act, and sympathetic films. Life is very short, and American life, even American, does not have "ample" time to waste in watching this piece.
