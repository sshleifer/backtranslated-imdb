It seems that the young group at St. Elmo's Fire that has just graduated from college hardly seems able to reach secondary school for less than four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy, and stupid, yet it seems that writer and director Joel Schumacher puts them on the line of a generation. Through a set of "up and comers" that are now out of date, a background tag that looks exactly like the "love conditions" and the writing that blurs this circle above us, "Fire" is a trivial fire, one that gets even more embarrassing with passing Years. * 1/2 of ****
