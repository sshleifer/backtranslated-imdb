This movie is one giant pant pant. Paul Schrader is totally lost in his bad scenario. The steering is about as coma as it can be without actually being walking during the process. <br /> <br /> Worse than that is Woody Harrelson, who usually loves him when cast correctly. He plays the role of "infantry", a gay man in DC playing the role of social comrade with the wives of boredom of the Washington elite. He could not have been more distant if he had been cut off from a magazine and bounced in front of the camera on a lollipop. His "southern dialect" is that the "out-of-the-shelf" version, which runs from beginning to end of each line, delivers it as if the heat of the south and its moisture are still drained of every ounce of energy it has. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst tone in the film. His "friend", played by Moritz Blipetro, tries to influence a kind of Middle Eastern dialect that is so clumsy that he can barely connect the bad lines written to him. He is unable to write his picture despite the fact that he is German in real life and speaks several languages ​​- one Italian! Is this a good reason to throw someone else not thinking? <br /> <br /> From story to scenario, to guidance, to camera work, to performances, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only moments allowed in this film were three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Christine Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to achieve this through this film with their dignity and ingenuity. In fact, all three are excellent, despite falling into a really bad film. Unfortunately, no one can be good enough to recover this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses, see them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
