Can I start by saying that Cassie Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work so much. I wish he had been in more films that offered his talent. With this saying, Soul Survivors was a very bad film. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I would say that I blame the bad text almost. Affleck is a very talented actress, and Wes Bentley is distinguished by his outstanding performance at American Beauty and Melissa Sagmiller, and Eliza Dushko is currently a Hollywood girl. I do not think any of the actors have entered the program, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to this kind of horror is an exaggeration. He has had shifts and reflections expected, but they have not led anywhere ... except for further confusion. I found the end very hostile to the climate, because it did not seem logical or really answered any of the questions I had about the story story. <br /> <br /> I wish I could make this film a good review, but I can not. Honestly, the only thing I think you'll find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.
