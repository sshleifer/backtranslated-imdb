Where is Michael Kane when you need him? I've seen most of the many MST3K seasons, but the flick before this season (episdoe K-20) is one of the worst films that have been produced easily. Three stars, Lee Majors, Chris McPheis and Bourges Meredith are wrestling with the worst set of cinemas ever, and they are making lines that must be written by a Dick Cheney-style clique of lawyers from Exxon and GM trying to cut funding for the public. Transit and energy efficiency. It seems to have been filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. The Logan run makes it look like a movie chapel resembling the Sistine Chapel with Shakespeare. I can not imagine watching it without a comment from Crow and Servo because it can not be overcome even though. Obviously what we need in Hollywood is a kind of 401KB which prevents the need for actors to watch bad movies like this in order to pay for health care. Through the theme "Pollution and Leadership Rights", in the end, I half expect the vision of Charleston's Heiston veil to deliver the "Dead Hands" speech. Me, can I forgive you this in 1989, but 1981?
