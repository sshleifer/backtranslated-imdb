This film has nothing to do with Jack The Ripper (if I think) his other film, E-Grade, consists of a group of horny teenagers in certain sex scenes They are monitored before splashing the spleen on a nearby tree. Not scary, funny or amusing. If you really feel like you're silly stuff without a plot, see Cabin Fever, at least the director did not drown halfway through this skill. Just watched this if you do not have anything at all in life and the only thing on the TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV.
