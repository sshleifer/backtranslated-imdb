Some wonder why there are no longer films by Ms. Murphy after this film. Is because this film blew completely mucus. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, it's owned by Disney, but it'll be bigger than adults). The film is very small child, because the book series is not. Casting is all wrong for characters. Characters do not behave the way they do in books. Why was Tucker changed to a man? He's a girl in scary books! Was this done to make the movie appeal to the boys? Shish. Where was Piotr, the gray cat? One of the most impersonal characters of the book is absent from this filth. Rita May Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow up her work was a mistake. A moving feature film, perhaps in the work of Don Bloth's artistic work, fits in with Murphy's film. In general, I give this movie 2, because Disney produced a film at least from a series of low-esteem books. But, I hope they are better. Either way, I still have my books to entertain me.
