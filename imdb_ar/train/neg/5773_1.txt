Another wonderful effort by the most difficult American filmmakers. His knowledge of racism is amazing, and I like it on more than one level. The accusations that Lee is just an obscure little racist, a stingy dwarf who exploits Hollywood's affirmative action system to shoot poor-quality movies, is non-sensational, just right-wing propaganda. The idea that Lee would use the current climate of political health in America to produce anti-white and hate-filled films is simply malicious and malicious. <br /> <br /> Even some of my critics go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African-Americans, with the suppression of other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD has been published by people who resist the peaceful coexistence of different races America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the film is a long, early dialogue between the rich black Republican and the others on the bus. The views given by this man are simply wrong - in all areas. 100% UNTRUE. He lacks education, unlike the well-educated youth of INFORMED who throw him out of the bus. <br /> <br /> Terrible performances, and the smart scenario offers a viewing experience that has been discussed by any political films ever since. <br /> <br /> I also want to refer to the persistent lies in which only one million people participated and 80,000 people participated! <br /> <br /> (Now all you have to do is take the antitheses for all the capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what message did he send me here? If someone disagrees with your political views, you simply use violence and get rid of the bus. I thought the film said "Take the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr.Lee is to separate the bus after all, no different from those KKK crazies before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the Democratic Party's line of thinking. So much for "liberating the slaves" ... <br /> <br /> Final credits: "This movie was funded entirely by blacks." Distributed and marketed by Hollywood's main studio run by Jews and whites despised by Farrakhan ...
