In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to chase Tall Man, assisted by a 9-year-old black guy, G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (died in the original phantom). Figure 3 is a rather disappointing complement, as Gore and black comedy are less inspiring and exciting as they were in Phantasm II. I felt that the stress was placed only on Reggie's inefficiency as a lover and his talent as a comedian standing. The humor in the previous film was drier and more compelling, and better suited to such a story. Also, the settings are not horrible here, in addition to the continuous presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not clear? There is still a lot of unfairness but not half satisfactory this time. By the way, watch out for the extremely dangerous version because it shows the most gratifying killings on the screen. The whole Phantasm series represents a lifetime achievement for Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes so far? V being produced. The first one is a classic half-cult, the second is a horror feast of gore and violence can easily skip the rest. a. Michael Baldwin returns to Mike, although James Legros photographs his character better in Fantasem II.
