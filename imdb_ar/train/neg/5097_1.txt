Unlike most other commentators, I strongly hate this series. <br /> <br /> I began to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what was going on around all the strange attacks (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And realized that I had sat through 26 episodes consisting primarily of self-loathing of self-centered, selfish and compassionate personalities. It is a real fluctuation between alien / robot battles and these dark, flashy scenes where one or more people can say or shout "I hate you /" 10-12 times in a row. <br /> <br /> I can not really see either Shinji or Asuka (two main characters) show growth or change. (I can not see which other characters are learning or growing, either.) I wanted to wake them up and ask them to live a bloody life during the first episodes. Shinji really has a kind of helpless despair that makes people angry rather than charity, and Asuka is an exciting knowledge of I was so angry that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she appeared in. Oh, and more than anyone else, they hate everything, and they say it's often too much. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of the manga and not hated I have read that the series of the creator / writer wrote this and he is suffering from depression, and I can believe it; it made me depressed to see it ... Is this the purpose of this series? I honestly ask ... Is it designed to make the viewer confused and upset? If you suffer from depression, why not write a book or biography about it, instead of blending it with foreigners and mica? This strange war plot, as far as I can tell, does not lead anywhere at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, as I am really intrigued by the number of people who claim to like this set of blocked plots, I can do that. I can not help but wonder how many of them already find it good, and how many say they do it because they are told it's good.
