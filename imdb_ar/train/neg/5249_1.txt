I am 13 years old. I hated this film, the worst film on earth. I totally wasted my time, watching it and disappointment because of it on the cover and on the back of the film it looks good, but I was wrong. But when I saw the Delta was quite different and a bad actress, I did not really know how the girls were trying to be confused. The film was in some parts confusing and I never enjoyed it, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it would improve, but it was not, it was boring, boring, and I said BORING.and I do not think many other people liked it,
