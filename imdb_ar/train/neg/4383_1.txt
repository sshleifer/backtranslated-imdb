Worst Comedy Bob Hope ever (including some intense competition). Hope, on an island with seafarers, dreaming loudly in the bathtub with a girl from the army "leading his ship." Someone has definitely directed this hacking into the abyss, featuring Felice Diller and Jenna Lolobrgida and still unable to make any laughs or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need it?
