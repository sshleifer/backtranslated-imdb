After I watched this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to beat it - but after reading the other comments, I have no heart. It is clear that this film has been a great success for children of a certain age. Well, let me not be a full Grinch; it may still be useful for some children - if they are not very media-savvy and not more visually sophisticated, for example, from watching LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you are an adult, stay away; you will not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Good bits: Barbara Kellerman where the charming, especially in her early scenes with Edmund, creates the right mix of attractive evil and restricted insanity. (On the stone table, slightly above the top). Michael Aldridge in the secondary role of Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry, where Mr. Tumnus also enjoys some kind of skillful and skilled conduct that we expect from the BBC's best drama business. Ze Aslan works very well, well thought out. They only received the right eyes. <br /> <br /> Bad bits: almost everything else, but there are two areas in particular. One, casting. England is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British school children. How could they have ended up with these four hardness? They move like wooden soldiers and they also talk. Peter has no gravitas or charisma (which is clearly shorter than his presumably younger brothers); Edmund is just a net. And Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox Just as Lucy was so wrong, so clear and dangerous in this part that I can not imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two, fashion animals. Again, they seem to have worked with some children. If children are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting and reliable characters, this film may be a favorite. But for the viewer with evolution, for example, the 12-year-old who saw the prisoner of Azkaban? When Mr. Beaver comes out from behind that tree, there will be a lot of harsh laughter and irony. Fashion does not work only - I could not, and I think that no adult or modern teenager could not suspend the suspension of disbelief when looking at Mr. Beaver. Later animations (griffon, etc.) work better, are easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: Ten stars for very young and tender; anyone else reads or re-reads the book and watches the much better film that spreads in your imagination.
