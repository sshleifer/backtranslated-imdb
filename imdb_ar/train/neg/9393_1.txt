Really, really, deeply, sadly, horribly. But actor Clayton Moore (a film of Color Ranger) skillfully acquires himself. He is the only person. <br /> <br /> A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to stir up the depths of the beautifully transparent special effects, Southern California as the "moon" (repeatedly), and the act is so inefficient that it may be a parody . . . But it is clear that it is not - no humor here, except unintentionally. <br /> <br /> Dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, fashion. . . Well, said enough. Plot? What plot? The bad guys (well, the wicked bad guys) and his followers, including his ground client named Krog (well listened or will doubt that it is a spoof in the name of McDonald's founder Ray Crooke) and his incredibly uncertain weapons (which, however, Download; like Commando Cody, so there are many confrontations to shoot). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
