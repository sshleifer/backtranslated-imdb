What a mess !! Why made this film? This, and other films of "caliber" should be instructive tools on how not to produce a film. Children may be impressed, but anyone over the age of 10 may agree or disagree. To make matters worse, such great talent as Wobi Goldberg and Armin Muller Stahl have been completely lost in a movie that deserves no notice.
