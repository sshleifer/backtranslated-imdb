Well, if not for Ethel Waters and her 7-year-old Sammy Davis (referred to here without the son), Rufus Jones would be one of the worst stereotypes of African-American stereotypes seen from the early modern era and was not Worth seeing because of it. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing "Am I Blue?" And "under our hearts Harlem" while Mr. Davis tells us how his experience in his childhood at Chubbiz prepared him for his supernatural status as an adult. He dances so well here that I thought he was a young man with decades of experience. So if you're willing to ignore negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should provide some good fun. Note This is the fourth time I see today and hear the song "I'll Be Happy When You're Dead You're Rascal You" which I made in a movie this time by Davis. The song must be very famous at this time.
