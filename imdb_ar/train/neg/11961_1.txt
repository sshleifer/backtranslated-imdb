Anyone who can find replacement value in this piece of crap should check for his head. We have a wife who is addicted to heroin who works part-time and has wounds all over her body, and the wounds she received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now, mother's milk is flowing all over the kitchen floor, so the release is somewhat like Helen Keller putting her hands in the running water. We have a husband who starts by caring for a prostitute who turns into his daughter (gets angry at him because he came very quickly) and ends up killing his colleague, having sex with her body, and then cutting her. We have a child who is relentlessly bullied by his colleagues and who comes home and outwit his mother. You see, everything is circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this terrible pile is when the father kills the torment of his son. It's good that this turkey is filmed on video because otherwise it would be a waste of the film expensive. If this person who thinks that artists should care about this slide is really dangerous, it's no wonder that most people think that artists are crazy. We saw this lousy film, then we put on "Zero Woman, The Accused." Oh, my God, it was like an extension for anyone who was worse. What is happening in Japan these days? Sick sick patient.
