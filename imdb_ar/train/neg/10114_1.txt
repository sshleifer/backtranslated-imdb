This is one of the worst movies ever. I love cheesy movies but this is simply awful. Where are the pictures in the film on the box? I think more money has been spent on DVD box illustrations than on the entire film. <br /> <br /> Why is a DVD company issued so that the cover is too misleading? I feel like I'm a fool to rent this movie based on the box. As far as I explore IMDb, I should have done a little research and put up a list before visiting my local video rental shop. I have no one but myself to blame. I want my money and time again. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, stick the cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It would be much more fun. You have been warned!
