Many people seem to be impressed with the film, so I feel a bit bad about giving it a bad rating. But after sitting for 96 minutes, I feel I have to do it. Where the heck is the plot in this film ?! I have to miss it, I was waiting for the story to unfold and nothing happened. The end was certainly "somewhat appalling" but it did not accumulate. I forgot about half the time, so they did not develop characters. The acting was good, and most of the time it was believable, but I could see it most of the time. So ... without giving up anything, I must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I did not understand why there was too little film, or a lot of it. I can not decide who you will be, so I say judge for yourselves. I do not even know whether renting them would be a good idea, cost and all ... <br /> <br /> Widget: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Representation: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel this is too high Really, I keep my voice at the top.
