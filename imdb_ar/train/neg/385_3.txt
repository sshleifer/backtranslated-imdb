The drama / ambiguity of a poorly written plot about the possibility of presenting AIDS to the public by the government. Wlaschiha plays a lesbian researcher looking for answers - hard to find within this blurry plot. Although cinematography itself is commendable, the camera crashes for characters of real depth instead of shallow, and amateurs must act regrettably. Grade: D +
