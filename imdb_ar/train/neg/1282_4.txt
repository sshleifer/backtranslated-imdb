Here's one of those films that the studio's insistence on a happy ending has ruined. Disputes that have been settled for years are settled in a few minutes. It was more interesting to pump the tone of mystery. The talented Barbara Stanwyck retreated from a sudden shift from an independent, assertive woman to the kind of consistent female of her life. Brent, as usual, is above his head and then there is a ridiculous position from Gig Young playing a character called Gig Young. There is someone who mentions "Gig Young" and then shows up but Gig Young, the actor! Worth to see far less than it could have been.
