This movie "B" is really terrifying. They are ingenious and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine "turned into a business", almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and shed light on some of the popular music groups of 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets three standard minutes, except for the Brothers Mills, who for some reason justify two numbers. Anne Miller does not try to dance until the last two minutes of the film, and has little to do except to strangle her objects amidst a barrage of national propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film, in my opinion, took place in the Duke of Ellington section. It seems that the band is playing on the train and stands in awkward positions. (In the far south at that time, the band was separated in rail cars when traveling.) Johnny Hodges sees next to Duke, and can also identify Harry Carney. In the final moments of the film, trumpet player / violinist Ray Nance rushed into the camera and "Tom the Uncle," filling his eyes and waving his head the way Willie Best did in many films. For modern audiences, especially jazz fans, this tribute to the class is really sad. Some movies go best unseen.
