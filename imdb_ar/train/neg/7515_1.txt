Absorbs. That's all I told him about this unfortunate excuse for a movie. Absorbs. Absorbs. Absorbs. I mean, what the hell were they thinking? No fools should ever be allowed to make other films. The acting was so bad that he failed to entertain at a bad level. The attempt at a "gay scene" was sad. I felt very bad for the women concerned. This movie sucks! Suck! Suck! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors of a sequel. <br /> <br /> God help us <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All
