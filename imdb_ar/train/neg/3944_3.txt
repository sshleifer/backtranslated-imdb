My Name is Modesty is based on an episode about one page of Blaise's 10th novel Night of the Morningstar. Describes the incident in which the young actress Modesty (17 in the book, the mid-twenties of the film) confirmed her leadership in a war on a casino. Since this was set up before the actual adventures of Blaise, her trusted friend Willi Garvin is not in the film. This is one of the main problems because the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the wonderful aspects of novels and the long comic strip. The other problem is that the film is simply incredibly boring because it is really just one small episode being blown up in a script. This choice is fine but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as a heroine and the elderly actually do not play the role of young humility. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution to not losing the Blaise franchise.
