Myron Breckenridge (Rex Reid !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - a dead drunk) and goes out as Mira (Raquel Welch). Then she decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and begins to teach the history of cinema at the acting college run by the corrupt Johnston (Do not Ask) and break up a young happy couple (young, handsome, lucky Roger Herren and Farah Fossett - yes Farah Fawcett. <br /> <br /> They took a wonderful novel by Gore Vidal, which was indisputable and, of course, tried to portray it, hired an Englishman who had an anti-American stance and hired a handful of dubious "talents" (Welch, Reid) (Houston, Carden, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, May West), all together .... Surprise! An absolute disaster. > The film was rated X when released (reduced to R), mostly due to a tasteless scene where Welch resorts to Rusty (Roger Herren) and the scene in which Welch fucks with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattery ... The viewer jumps everywhere and people say and do things that are meaningless ... This is not good at all, but I never felt bored. <br /> <br /> Acting is changing violently ... Reid It is terrible ... really sad.Huston chews the scene again and again then goes back to the extreme. The welsh is actually not as bad as Mira but its lines are meaningless so you never know what makes them. The West is barely depicted in the film (Nima) and it is really interesting to hear an 80-year-old woman tossing sexual jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was young, handsome and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things to say about it ... you're just watching it in disbelief. Must see the movie - to believe !!!!
