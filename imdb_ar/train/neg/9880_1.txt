I saw this film coming back in the first theatrical version, in an empty theater justifiably. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this film is still clearly stuck in my mind as the worst film ever; or at least the worst I allow myself to see. <br /> <br /> Representation is far from the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students who are out of the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene reached new heights. But after a while, even that suspicious pleasure faded away and became really sad.
