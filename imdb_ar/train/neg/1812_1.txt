Go immediately and rent this movie. The bottom shelf in your local video store will be covered in dust. Nobody will touch it for years. It may be up to $ 0.5 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films that can be compared with this - the celluloid version of the goo that forms at the bottom of the trash after a few years. Yes, I gave it a "1", but it really deserves much less. 1-10 Metrics are not designed with such things in mind.
