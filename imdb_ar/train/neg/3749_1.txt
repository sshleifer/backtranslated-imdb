Wow, I love and respect anything done by David Lynch. However, this film is similar to the first director's attempt to produce a false artistic video. <br /> <br /> To give you two examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually a visual way out, but it has little visual art content (blank walls, "shots up" with a roof in Background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch is usually very proud of the sound, but even in this you can hear the sound of the camcorder. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that it has nothing to do with this film. Unless ... <br /> <br /> ... This is a joke, by David, to force fans to search their website (for hours) only to find this driving group. I hope so, because this idea is at least funny.
