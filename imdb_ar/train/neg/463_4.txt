Blonde Blonde was not shown. Essentially, it was a wonderful version of the girl from Dumb and Dumber, but it was less laughable, and they used a lot of background sounds and music. WAY TOO MUCH Background sounds and music if you ask me !!!! It starts very boring, and no one is completely hidden. I do not feel anywhere anytime soon, and I feel frustrated because this nonsense continued. Maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this one movie is another 30 minutes. I found it amusing and fairly enjoyable as I approached the end, but this was the only part. Well, I could not help but like the characters Pamela Anderson and Dennis Richard little. So this movie did not laugh on my side, I kept my attention. I can not avoid avoiding this movie altogether, but there are thousands of movies best for you to spend your time and money on from Blonde and Blonder.
