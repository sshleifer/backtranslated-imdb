Men in MST3K must see this dog of the film. It's basically a breakthrough in Dubby in Hollywood that can not land in any of the vehicles. He has this strange obsession with Taxi Drive. What does this stupid actor do? He dyes his blond hair and starts acting like a L.A. With naive hope that this would lead to his acting roles. You will laugh at your head in many funny scenes of this movie. Such as when a friend of the Exquisite actor is broken heart and wailing and says: "How can you do this to me?" Why are you crying? Cos he dyed his blonde hair and became an Exquisite Surfer to get acting chariots. This movie does not make sense at all! The actor who played the role of Governor on Benson in this too is playing right-handed political dialogue with stupid stupid lotsa. This movie will crack you, trust me. Are you talking to me ?!
