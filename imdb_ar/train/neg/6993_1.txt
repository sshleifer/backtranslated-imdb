What a terrible film. I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this process. Please tell me why Veng Rimes and Mikey Beaver starred in this film? Mehki Pfifer is wonderful at E.R and perhaps Ving Rhames did not know what he was doing. I feel appalled for them. The musical background that I must say is not suited to the story ALL ATLLL It is amazing how you can find those directors who have no life at all in producing a good and balanced film. I hope that in the future there will come out no such horrific director such a director ever made such a wonderful classic film. This film should not be in the first place. Advice to everyone who saw it, please tell me I'm right because I may not be the only viewer I did not enjoy. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
