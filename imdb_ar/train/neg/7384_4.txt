Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Segal) was appointed in France on a reconnaissance mission Along with three new recruits youth strike team after the disobedience ordered directly from the top. But the night before the strike, they were all found dead by a murderer with apparently stiff strength. With the French police roaming around with their own investigations, he is looking for those responsible for himself, only to uncover a corrupt army faction dealing with a deadly new drug that changes a person's DNA and gives them a terrifying new power. <br /> <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Bad tampering after production. And bad trailer. Very bad film. But, I must say, I do not think the force of the attack is the worst. I know that this will make me unwanted with most other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!) But I think a lot of criticism stems from all the bad news that appeared before the film rather than its actual quality itself. I must say that there was nowhere near a lot of dubbing or editing on Robbie's way as I was led to believe. The dubbing there (which made him look like Martin Chen had a groin problem!) Was very awful and very frequent but he was not used to much of the film as I thought. The plot flowed smoothly along with her thinking in all the chaos with the original final film, Harvester, which went on. As one of the other reviewers noted, the film has a nice Gothic look on it, and a new touch to Seagal's film. <br /> <br /> The absolute lethal low point, however, was the total and total lack of any exciting action. , With a few scenes of fighting that were filmed badly for any fun. <br /> <br /> I must be honest, though, I would rather see this again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out Out for a Kill. **
