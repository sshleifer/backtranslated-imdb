The film does not revolve around a film about a beautiful couple but without minds decide to live their dream and take people on diving trips. The pair immediately chooses the wrong customers and mingles with some people seeking to recover the items we see fall to the bottom of the ocean during the sequence of opening credits. It would have been better for you to look great looking directly into a video movie if you were not interested in the first place. The offers are inapplicable and the plot is not really bad, or the manager and the producers were not supposed to redirect it to make sure we see lots of elegant people in the swimsuit (or, I think, the "unclassified" nickname of a nude bare breast). The film never generates any tension and does not rise above the level of a television movie that can be forgotten. If you see this, you will not be distracted because eye candy is fun, but we really need to stop producers from producing justifiable movies for paid leave.
