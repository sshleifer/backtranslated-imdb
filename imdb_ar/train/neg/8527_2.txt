There are three films with this style of animation that I fondly remember from my youth. The Last Unicorn, Flight of Dragons and The Hobbit. I have copies of both Dragons and The Hobbit (both excellent) and I have not seen The Last Unicorn for more than a decade. It was so today and now I wish I had not done. What bothered me the most was the script. He was incredibly unstable and often irrational. Things will happen without cause and other things that may occur without explanation. We are not just talking about small things here; we are talking about the main plot points! The story itself is not great to start with, but it could have worked if the script was decent. Not so close. Moreover, the music was awful! I know that music in films like this rarely contains what one might call classic pieces, but the music in this film made me want to hit myself with a bowling ball. It was one of those films I would show my children one day, but it was cut. I do not think I can sit back in this clown again. Disappointed is put it mildly.
