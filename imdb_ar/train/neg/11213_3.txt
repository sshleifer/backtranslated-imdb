Well ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I am proud of myself for this fact. Several times there are some gems in the bombs b rated. But this film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I love horror film good ... but with plot and spirit of movement. The opening scenes look good. Decent music and photos. Then go down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now this in turn will threaten to reveal his secret. They made so much focus on the film. So what rang in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere he did not have to be. No need to keep putting it up. If this man has an affair with this girl and in a hotel drops and hits her head at the end table. So, instead of letting everyone know about his relationship, he decided to throw the body. Her twin sister is now trying to figure out where she is and what happened to her. After seeing her sister again and again (zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the body site, she finally found her. Now the body is being recovered and ready to deal with the only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that they did not have much of a plan. Only to pretend that she was her twin and met the man where the body was thrown. The idiot did not believe it until he killed her. Everything was revealed there, and although she had a weapon ... she somehow managed to stifle her. So the last scene of the film is "spirits" and her twins come out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this film that the bad guy wins. Do not die one or two innocent people. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: the photos <br /> <br /> Bad things about the film: the sound effects of the music are long and err in the wrong direction of the low-grade plot acting of some and not all actors
