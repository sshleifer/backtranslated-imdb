In what I can say was stealing my time I took to see this movie, I must say what a terrible experience. Faye Ann Lee is an awful and unconvincing actress in this film. Larryjoe76 is obviously a Shell references. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tang must be after the film to earn little or no revenue. The vulgar plot is trying to compete with other compilers and mingle in the scene. It was like watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and space. You've seen better movies on YouTube.
