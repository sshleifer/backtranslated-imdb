I am very impressed by the novelist / screenwriter Michael Chapon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a wonderful film by Kurtis Hanson. His brilliant novel "The Amazing Adventures of Cavalierre and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago and had a hand in Spider-Man 2, arguably the greatest comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed great comic pieces, such as Doodleball and the short-lived "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". With the cast including Peter Sarsgaard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nault and Mina Suvari, it seems like a non-thinking. <br /> <br /> It is. Literally. <br /> <br /> John Foster is the title of Bechstein, the son of a recently graduated Nolte. John is in a state of suspended development: he works at the minimum wage in Book Barn, and has a miserable relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which is no more than just a plentiful amount of sex, without plans other than to stop his career which has no Passion for it. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, his former roommate John introduces Jane (Miller), the beautiful violinist. Later that night they go out for a pancake, and John asks a question that begins to get rid of his deadly state of existence. "I want you to tell me something you never told him in one spirit, if I do, I'll make this night indelible." John then tells her a recurring dream of his dream of walking around a town that looks at the faces of outsiders passing by, but none of them is seen in the eye. "I imagine it must be what death looks like," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, Cleveland (Sarsgaard), Jean's brutal friend Jane, is kidnapped from his job and taken to an abandoned steel mill. John, Cleveland and Jane spend every moment waking up together to attend punk rock concerts, drugs and drink lots of alcohol. This does not sit well with Flux, who drives John into a more personal relationship, which allows her to meet his new friends and father. The film then tries to take us on John's journey, removing the restrictions imposed on him by his father, Flux and his clogged job, where he finds freedom and expression through his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem in our follow-up to follow John throughout the film: he is totally uninterested. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks in life like the invisible ghost he described to Jane the night they met her. At first this is not a problem. But it never got more interesting. He's a totally negative character. It is simply followed by Cleveland and the Bohemian Gene, but he has never given us any indication of what he cares about or wants to do himself. <br /> <br /> Thus, the film and its supporting characters have no place. To go and little to do other than the party, have sex and get arguments. In other words, a lot of ado about nothing. What we have here is the shallow skin of a good film without anything inside. Massive cinematic photography, massive vocal expression with characters sprang from a distance, lots of sex scenes both direct and gay, big arguments, more angry sex, chase scene and tragic death ... but does not seem to matter. Ironically, at some point, Jane was confused in a number of John's actions aimlessly, and I asked him, "What's going on, John? Yes, John, I say. We in the audience are dying to know them too. <br /> <br /> The title of "The Pittsburgh Puzzle" should refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional for actual people. The movie never allows us to enter. We never know what makes any of them a sign. We see them doing a lot of things, but we do not know why. The absence of "why" is one of the worst things the film can get.
