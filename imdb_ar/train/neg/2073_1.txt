My God. Oh my God, I can not overcome this film. God was awful. Horrible, terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy it in a 99 cent fund. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. in my life. in my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, girl? are you kidding me. Be real like a kind of new Barbie doll .. Are you a super woman? are you kidding me. It was fake fake fake fake. It does not seem that the people of the town care that there is a blonde flying only as she cuts her way around the city saves a fire .. Oh big! <br /> <br /> Jesus, did I have or did this just the film look offensive? I think what you need to be a great hero is a double couple, blonde hair streaming, no glasses, and a tight suit of skin ?! <br /> <br /> If she is trying to be romantic ... .. God, I do not know. It was terrible, if love meant taking someone to an art show and having sex in bed and in the air .. than it was completely love! <br /> <br /> It was all pathetic, everything went fast. First, this person was single, more than dating G-girl .. which separated from the date of that girl Hana .. And .. It continues. <br /> <br /> I must say that this film made me wonder .. How the hell did they get this in the theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
