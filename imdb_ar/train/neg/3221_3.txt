I watched this on the tube last night. The actor involved caught my attention first. The first scenes were interesting. Some funny some grief. Good personal development. I felt that the last third of the film differed. If it was not in the first part of the film, I would have stopped watching. I kept watching how they related to each other. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that this has never happened. Especially since I did not like the extension period in which many of the characters spoke about Yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Is it recommended? No, I do not think so. As other reviewers have mentioned, many slang languages ​​are dated (1960s) but they were not very fragmented. The finish completely turned me off.
