Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What shall I say also? Kate Jackson must be desperate to guide. She may have to go back to acting ... in her second belief she was a bad actress for. Who will put the money to produce something so bad. I love anti-Christ films and I usually laugh well and I'm afraid but this is a bad bad film. Starring was worse than in the soap opera. Special effects, if you can call it, where funny. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in a slow motion you would see the pipes fired by the blood. We had to turn off the disc after only 30 minutes. This so-called original printed films must be destroyed, all discs and tapes destroyed, and all persons associated with the film industry must pay money to the people who rented the film. Then these people should never be allowed to act, take pictures or shoot anything other than their home movies.
