What a descending movie! This film is located in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from POV's Hollywood filmmakers, and tries to be a deeply social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical and vibrant personalities with widely divergent social and economic backgrounds cross paths in their daily, humid lives. The plot is disjointed and disappointed. The film maintains many imaginative competitions, such as shooting from a moving car, an abandoned child left in weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a man flying overhead in the night sky, and a child in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> Through all these events, the only constant is the generous assistance of social "ideas" transmitted through dialogue, where characters compare observations about their life experiences. "When you sit on the edge of that Grand Canyon, you realize what a joke we people are," one character says to another. "Those rocks laugh at me, and I can tell me, and my concern; it's the true humor of this Grand Canyon." <br /> <br /> Another character revolves around the meaning of all this: "There is a gap in this country, a gap that is widening between people who have things and people who do not wear ... No such big hole that opened In the ground, like ... Grand Canyon, and what is flowing ... is a rage, rage and rage creates ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the appalling and coercive natural dialogue, aside from the shallow, sincere characters, apart from the stupid plot, the pace of the story is painfully slow. Acting is inspiring and wonderful. The tone of the film is seductive and self-indulgent, in contempt for the viewers' scenario. <br /> <br /> This was a film project approved by Hollywood, who fancy themselves as holistic teachers, looking from top to bottom. They believe that their film will be an amazing discovery for us, the filmgoers who do not know, and are eager to see the true meaning of American social change.
