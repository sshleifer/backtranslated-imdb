I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad film. No ounces of humor, no ounces of talent around. <br /> <br /> I'm lazy. <br /> <br /> Normally, I see a bad film and curse. This was so bad, I've already done a review to try to save others from the totally boring mess that has fallen victim to it. <br /> <br /> I'm breaking my version of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's so lame even to use a clear room. very boring. See "vampire vices" or "shock, shock, shock" in search of absolute folly that enjoys some benefits as entertainment. This sludge looks awful, awful, and anyone who does it must feel horrified.
