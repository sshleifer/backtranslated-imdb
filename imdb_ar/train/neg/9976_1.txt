The first scene in the "problem child" has a child urinating in the face of a nun. For this film, this is brilliant. A disgusting "comedy", it is incompetent on many of the levels it believes in. John Ritter is the good father who embraces the child from hell, and praises him for preserving his dignity in the onslaught surrounding him from the individual displays of nagging and humor. And what does Jack Warden do in hell? Denis Duggan is naive and obnoxious in his attempts to capture feelings when this is done with this horror, the film is made very badly, it is a very strange experience. But do not mind all of that. The highlight of all is Michael Oliver, the most hateful and unwanted child actor ever to hit the screen? Believe me, you'll want to slap it in the mouth.
