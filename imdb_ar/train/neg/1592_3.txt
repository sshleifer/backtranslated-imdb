To intensify the drama of the story of this mummy maternity ward, it is placed in a special suite for "hard cases". The main story is Loretta Young. She is on leave from the long prison for murder. Will the doctors save her child at the expense of her life, or respond to her husband's request on the contrary? Melodrama and feelings are dominant, and they are not the kind of sincere, to say the least. For example, to keep things going, this hospital has a psychic wing next to the maternity ward and allows a woman suffering from hysterical wandering in pregnancy to steal children. <br /> <br /> There is enough laughter and ridicule. To be recognized as a movie by Warners, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who lurks in a bottle of hot water while waiting to have twins, to her grief, she finds that there is now a law against selling. Example of her partner: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be cautious." Allen McMahon is of course very reliable as a great nurse, but do not expect to give her an exciting moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the child's scene turns everyone into live music. . Even given the obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is now.
