shock! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Jagarin's jury alive. He was honest, modest and gentle. He was comfortable and seemed to be a cultured and cultured person. In this film I saw a clown! The actor looks like a puppet with gestures and simulated effects. Make a cartoon! Gagarin was the real someone else! Incredible movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after films such as "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and People" from Chertok and "Korolev: Myths" and "facts from Golovanov. , Misrepresentation and production, and many shortcomings in the Space Race. <br /> <br /> The film is a boring display of the well-known historical facts in Russia, and many interesting facts about space projects have not been shown. For example, in 1945, Koroliev was no longer a prisoner (he was liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was not in the gold mine at Kolima prison, but in the office of the design of your prisons. Koroliev, who is a designer at the prison design office, did not bury the dead prisoners, but in Koroliev's work he worked as a dangerous excavator after 1940 (because the jailer has shoulder straps on his uniform). IMHO, the film's authors have no deep knowledge of this part of history and can not produce dramatic films Interesting.
