"It's better not to know, better to forget, better to be abandoned," he said. Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical improvements to Hollywood Horror, but a very bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, you feel like you are being preaching from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It seems as if the cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by a bad cop TV and Jerry Springer. It is appropriate, perhaps for a movie like The Hitcher, not a horror film by Russia. The result is that a wonderful place is potentially wonderful and some of the big potential scenes may be wasted and become ridiculous and not scary or meaningful.
