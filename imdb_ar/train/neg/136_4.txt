*** Vandals *** *** Vandals *** Do all teenage teenagers suffer from drought originality? It seems very awfully. First of all, this is a noble hypothesis that could have been used well. The nerd of young rejecters who grow up chasing and killing all the girls who tortured hell from him when he was in the beginner? I can not say that you do not have something to do. But this movie goes through the same suggestions as all the last slashes. Everything from the result to the camera angles allows us to predict accurately when a wrong warning appears and when the killer will hit. We know this style now. These slanted films of stupidity push the envelope of credibility more and more every minute. Allow me to ask you something: who will think, in his right mind, of a friend in a dark gloomy morgue in the middle of the night and surprise her out of the blue while she is alone and surrounded by bodies? Does this have any damn meaning at all? <br /> <br /> "Valentine's Day" is only occasionally innovative. One of the good shots includes the slaughter of Dennis Richards. I was trapped inside a pool and the killer licked it with chainsaw. There are some good songs in soundtracks, including a great song directed by Orgy. The music video is in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even acting is best at best. All actors sleep through their roles. Of course, David Burianz is often clever, even in his portrayal of the title character "Angel" Denise Richards is a wonderful actress, but maintains a stone surface throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is exactly as you expect: buzz, unreasonable, oblivious, cheesy and without a good scare in a scene. Do not care. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 4 (out of 10)
