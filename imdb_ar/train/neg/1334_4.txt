So I finally watched the movie "My Left Foot" last night after years of telling my mother how amazing it is ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is truly wonderful and amazing, but anyone who has the least exposure to the other should not expect to do anything less. <br /> <br /> The fatal misjudgment in my eyes was that when he became obsessed with proving this man's normal state, the film chose to show him a full jerk and a tone. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical link. Human beings always have the ability to object, and disability must not obscure that. I hope that neutral viewers will not be too tolerant of anomalous behavior and assume that circumstances make him automatically forgive. they did not. Behavior is normal, so yes, disabled people act - but they do not because they are disabled; they do so because they are unreasonable. No physical disability gives you the right to take a geek in public places, just because someone you love dislikes you. <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not wise to do whether you are disabled or able-bodied. Give someone an implicit permission to run football directly on your head for the sole purpose of installing them. (Admittedly, I once saved a penalty from the school star striker with my face, but I belonged to that time.) That was not for acceptance.) Taking part in a bar fight is another thing. Adhering to the fact that your father does not give you fellowship until you have demonstrated your ability to jump metaphorically through physical hoops takes the masochism a step too far. All these stupid things, and suffering through them as a means to show your courage do not make them less enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> So, yes, just because you've overcome the obstacles to achieving great things that does not make you less interesting ... as a good person takes priority; the creation of an inspiring example of disabled people should appear at the bottom of the list.
