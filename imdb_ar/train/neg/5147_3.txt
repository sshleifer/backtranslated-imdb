Perhaps the Blue Desert has the ability to be halfway up the road, and the thriller was the most personal personal thrill, not Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) stupid. When you are the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town outside the West. In her first days there, she met Randall Atkins Crazy (Craig Scheffer, played this part well) and that will not leave her side in the end. Fearing for her safety after having already been in the situation twice before, she had a friendly relationship with the suspicious town cop, Steve Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who should be convinced of Red herring thrown by the book). Smith needs Roberts to cooperate because, as he tells her, Atkins is being held and convicted of sexual assault. But the police lacked the evidence they had put away. <br /> <br /> The film had enough effects to make an interesting film at least because soon, there was confusion about who Roberts should trust. However, much of the intended thrill seems too compelling because Roberts' personality does not seem to interact with things as simple as we think. Their delayed reactions allow much of this thrill to happen easily and unconvincing, especially in the end. Perhaps Sweeney was the wrong choice for this role; a baby encountered in ways of this kind of personality reminiscent of Kevin Anderson's clear personality in "sleeping with the enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, that might be enough. Meanwhile, the movie is not so great, so it's a low-cost B movie.
