Worst DCOM I've seen. Start. Well, maybe not as bad as a smart home. This was just bad. The acting and story was fine, but the effects were soaked! <br /> <br /> It was very fake! The only good fighting scene was between Brother and Shane. Maybe that was the only scene I was passionate about. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was very boring and the genre ended abruptly. <br /> <br /> I will give her four prizes for Brenda Song, a very funny actress and one combat scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
