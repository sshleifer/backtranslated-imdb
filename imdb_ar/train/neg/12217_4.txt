As the budget of India continues to decline, you will usually get what you pay for, and let me just say, I did not pay much for the "world of fear" ... <br /> <br /> Author / Director: Williams brings us the story of an abandoned park, boxed by the spirit of retribution from a serial killer killed. Not a bad hypothesis, but implemented with a range of low budget errors. The camera's work is trying to be smoother for its audience, by using quick shortcuts to constantly cover up the fact that they have nothing or scary to show us. This becomes quite obvious away from the racket, where we recognize the potential killer, and soon realize that (acting) is the most terrifying thing that happens ... After a long painful series of surname, we return to modern times, yet the representation is still the same . "Frightworld" generates some of the somewhat unique cinematic works when viewing a scene from within the fun house, but with a very long runtime, can not save the film from below the average hell. <br /> <br /> They are some modest nudity, but not so much for gore, which is usually the grace preserved for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Bad B-Movies fans may really find something interesting here, otherwise, do not spend too much money.
