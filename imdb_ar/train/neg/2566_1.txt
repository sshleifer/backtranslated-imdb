Part of GEORGE 2 was recently discovered on TV, but I could not even push myself to watch it. Just awful! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula for the first film, which was bad enough. There was a lot of stampede, but the direction and the editing were not skewed and skewed, it was like watching the excesses or scenes deleted. The original sound of Ape the Ape was never enough to make me feel warm. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst part I've ever seen, and that's something to say. Jeez, because of the ten line IMDb, I have to keep writing when I have nothing to say about this artificial sequel to the TV. Disney, hang your head in disgrace.
