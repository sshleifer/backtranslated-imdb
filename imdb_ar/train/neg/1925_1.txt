Ron Howard face this? The cartoon of 1966 is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple piece of land. In this film, Howard gives us Whoville filled with greedy, whos, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not a mistake. I imagine that the text that was called is the most imaginative, so Carrie directed Tom Green and the result is the magic of the film. Like Danny Devitto's Batman Returns, Carish Grinch is so undesirable that any degree of comedy that might be extracted from his character simply evaporates. Where 1966 cartoons appeared on Greenwich, which we can all live with, Carrie Grinch is that angry old man without a soul whom we all saw at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself, or toddlers walking in the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is completely deprived of any degree of humanity, humor or insight at all, and his salvation at the end of the film rings falsely. The whole movie symbolizes a falsehood: there is some stupid competition in the lighting of Christmas, a failed attempt to explain why Grinch was such a shiver through the digging of his childhood, and an incurable puzzle about why some white people have this strange stretch of lips and some do not. Unlike the cartoons of 1966, I imagine that children will find this film tired and annoying and full of contradictory messages. Do we really need to see Sluty Smurve, nicknamed Christine Baransky as Martha May and Voyage? In addition, Ron Howard filled the actors with his uneducated relatives. Get rid of the necessary jokes, naughty jokes, sexual jokes, and other compulsive humor low Carreyesque, and you have a film that is far from the 1966 cartoon (or book inspired) as George W. Bush of rational, clear thought. Excellent on this great turkey.
