I do not post comments really, but I wanted to make sure people were warned about this film. It is an incomplete student film with no replacement features at all. At the technical level, she is completely amateurish - unintentional jumping edits in scenes, violent dubbing, etc. The plot is completely clich√©, the structure laughable, and the actor awkward. I do not want to be too harsh: I made my own student film, and they were all awful, but there's no reason why this film should be in the world where innocent fans will have to see it. <br /> <br /> The safe assumption that positive comments, like the team, are filmmakers, friends and family.
