It seems that the standard procedure for Swedish movies today is to start throwing the reasonableness out of the window and continue this path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a senseless film. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are stolen by a gang of "high-efficiency" thieves in military style. Two police officers begin investigating the case which quickly becomes more complicated than it will initially appear. <br /> <br /> As in the Swedish film, the cast consists of the same people whom I have seen over and over again. Michael Persperand must be in every Swedish film of the last few years! But that's good, I think Persbrandt is one of the few companies that offer strong performance here (as it usually does). Most of the film's problems revolve around the same story. First of all, robberies mostly feel like a background. Rather this is a film about a young policewoman battling to prove herself in a male world (such as not made a thousand times by a decent actress instead of Sophia Helen). Also there is an incredibly incredible plot development near the end which seems as reasonable as the fall of foreigners. But still, I think it was a very nice touch given that I was asleep half of that time. This has increased things a bit (and actually saved the rating from dropping another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same problem with most other Swedish movies of this kind. Simply the motion and thrill do not live up to the standards we used to have from other films of this kind (mostly from Hollywood). It is a cheap and comparatively cheap feeling. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should focus more on conspiracy and acting, forgetting to try to make "Hollywood movies - light" as they do now. Because this becomes another forgotten effort of the Swedish film industry. I rate 3/10.
