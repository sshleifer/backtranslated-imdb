Unfortunately, this is not "the best British Gore movie since Hellraiser", although the DVD cover claims this, and that's what tricked me into buying it. It is, however, a tribute to many of the great horrors of the old film, most notably Stable Amicus. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... was filmed on a mini DV, although we all know that it has more TV feel than a movie and can do much better. Each scene looks and sets and shoots as if it was lighting exactly the same way (standard key, packing, rear setting), enhancing the cheap appearance of the final piece. Gore's content, quite frankly, is laughable. From the opening shots where we saw a rubber head from the shredded man's foam, until you reached a cheap prop hammer, creature effects and terrible cg, there was nothing that impressed me at all. <br /> <br /> Acting is an abhorrent, near-zombie investigator to the Brummie Dwarf, by Danny Filth, a less convincing horror film The Punk movie I've seen in my life. Each of the sub-versions is more of a formula than the latter, and the groups are getting worse with the movie show. Look for "mental asylum" - a semi-independent Georgian house with a bad CG sign outside, the strangest (and not the best) hidden cell I have seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to reach the end of the film without being noticed (walking) at any opportunity. I found myself dusting sometime during the screening. <br /> <br /> However, it is one of the last known aspects of the Emily Booth breasts, which I think is one (or two) that it's going on for that. Once the problem is resolved, everything becomes fine. <br /> <br /> I heard that people are saying good things about Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe them, but in this guide, I'm not likely to. If you want a decent honor for Amex, avoid it and go to celebrate your gentlemen's birthday instead. <br /> <br /> Fight it now with Blair's Witch 2: The Book of Shadows for the title of the worst film I have seen so far.
