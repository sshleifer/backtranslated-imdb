I did not read one comment from the IMDb for this film that mentions how the Jewish character in this film jumped up and down like a little girl while a pistol was pointed at him with a racist head while the black character of the film looked pretty much down the gun's mouth. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone can see this as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not strongholds of tolerance as they are supposed to be and that the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make his characters like such large cartoons. <br /> <br /> On the roof, trying to portray the character of Ice Cube as a bad man, provoking Remy to become shaved off the racial head. But who eventually graduated in the Salvation film salvation? It seems that Singleton refers to the white color either that he is unable to empathize (no less sympathetic!) With his fellow black student or just able to walk in the way of skinheads. Many people who have been bullied by people of another sex do not resort to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Women who have been raped do not immediately appeal to lesbians, who are portrayed as worship rather than lifestyle. Honestly what is the point?
