I can not believe that Steven Seagal's career has fallen to the point that he has moved to producing fourth-rate films with second-rate actors. I have seen this move and I expect to see it dismiss the folly of some people as it usually does. When he is chosen to use one piece of judo game between the shoulder blades to take out a competitor and fall a guy like a lot of bricks, there is something wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is unbelievable as a film, and even if you read the story and read it as a novel, you will wonder why you took the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal passes by and seems to do just that because he is bound. He makes no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat the comments of others, but using stock footage of broken scenes and pictures of aircraft is pathetic. The situation of those scenes is broken, unclear, and the scenes themselves seem to have deteriorated over time. The film Zappruder featuring President John F. Kennedy is subjected to assassination more stable and clean. <br /> <br /> My sincere opinion is to tell you not to waste your time watching this movie, it is not up to the level of his work in the brilliant man or the wounds of exit. I read one review that says the film has a budget of $ 12 million (Sigal 5) and that the film is still budgeted. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> No wonder this is a direct DVD movie, as no one will play a conscientious theater.
