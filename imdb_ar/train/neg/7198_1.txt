After the famous Disney film George of the Gangle, I had high hopes for this. Great disappointment. The plot of bare pages, bad representation, bad visual effects. This film was based on one lame liner, and put the stupid (and useless) product, and the most distressing side-fright in the car of this mini-car. I took two little children to see him and they were bored with their minds. The only laughter he received from this film was a bad standby when he needed a laugh that showed a man getting a groin!
