We are not in the fairy tale of the naked Emperor. We may acknowledge the reality of what we see, without being stupid, admit that this presentation is incomprehensible in many respects and it is clear that much of it was created from pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> Well, obviously a lot of people like such things. I do not. I prefer to think well and plan planned. I also admit, that the presentation is more serious for my tastes and boring ... These love stories and drugs ... There is so much exciting soap with a lot of suspense (Dallas for example), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about these people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
