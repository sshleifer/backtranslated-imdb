In 1454, in France, the head of the magician Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was cut off and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was subjected to death, accused of witchcraft, intimidation and leantropy. Before they die, they curse the next generation of their executioner. In the present days (in the seventies), Paul Naschy, Betsabé Ruiz, and their friends, Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his lover Cristina Suriani go to a special session, evoking the spirit of Eric de Marnac. They decided to travel to Villas de Sade, a property of the Hugo family in the countryside, to find a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find the head of Alaric and the villain owned by them, and Mabel returns to life and executes the local people in the sacrifices of Gore. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that a bull amulet hidden in a well; they are trying with Maurice to defeat Alarc de Marnac and Mabel. <br /> <br /> At the end of last week, I bought a box of horror movies with five DVDs from Paul Nashcie for $ 9.98; although there were no references, I decided to take this opportunity. The first DVD with the uncorrected and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is the B (or C) trash that made me instantly remember Ed Wood. The funny story is revealed through a terrible scenario, directing, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and release and with many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can assure that Ed Wood's style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Address (Brazil): Not available
