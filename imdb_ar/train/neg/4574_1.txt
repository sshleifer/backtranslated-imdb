I went to this movie expected to be similar to the matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written bad plot in the film (with animated CG cells and peptides to take off). However, the real focus of the film is the heads of the modern "expert" who publish Hogwash in a new era feel comfortable among the plot segments. <br /> <br /> Sure, it swings enough. There is little real quantum physics at first. For example, it states that electrons exist as a particle and wave, and that the atom is mostly an empty space. However, the film takes a giant (and unscientific) leap, saying that quantum effects without subduction occur on large scales as well. The modern heads take it even further. As they said, the following is true: When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, native citizens could not see his ships because their minds were unable to perceive anything quite different. -Memitation can reduce the killing rate. With positive thinking, you can walk on the water. - Your thoughts can change the crystals of ice crystals in bottles of water. <br /> <br /> Hey, this is only in the first forty minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. Feel this movie like a movie that will show you your body to join a cult. After doing my duties, I realized that basically it was just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this can be considered a comedy comedy (although it is not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not see this movie.
