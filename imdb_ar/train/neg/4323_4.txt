"The European Holiday" (also known as the "European National Holiday") is the weakest "holiday" films (the first and third most outstanding films). While Chevy Chase, Beverly Angelo Clark and Eileen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Ross and Audrey Griswold), they are being given a weaker text this time by a very bad dialogue. This leads to the speed of suffering, with jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes the film to suffer is the fact that "jokes" are the same, glued together in pebbled text), instead of presenting a central plot like the other three holiday films. Well, they can not beat them all. 4 of 10.
