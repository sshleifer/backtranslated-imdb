The only reason I chose to give this shot was the reason why there was an Oscar winner Ernst Borgnin. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever shown. As far as I can tell, Burgen was the only actor in it. The other presentations were horribly uniform, and I was surprised that the studio actually pushed the "performers" to appear. This level of talent in the acting department was associated with a story so trivial and mysterious that I thought my eyes would begin to bleed by the time the credits started, and you had an ideal cinematic disaster. It is clear that the film was created to attract a children's audience, and fortunately, it was better than most original programs on Disney Channel and similar networks focused on children. But frankly, this does not say much.
