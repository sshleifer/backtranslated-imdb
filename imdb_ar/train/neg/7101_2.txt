I would like to give this film zero out of ten, but I will give it two films. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, this is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this film and has a glimpse of Kamal. I love Rani so much and I respect her and she is a wonderful actress. That's why I did not enjoy it in this film that accepts Kamal, but it's not big. Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this movie remarkable, lets you talk about this movie. Is it good or bad, I think it's a totally nonsense film made me arrogant. I'm a great critic, you can see the other 250+ reviewers by clicking on my name, I have a great taste. The film is not amusing is one thing, if this is supposed to be difficult to hit cinema, why there is no morale in this film. It is a biased film that is not a real story. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, and no man can kiss her properly anyway.
