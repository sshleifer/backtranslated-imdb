A lukewarm attempt to bring Elvis Presley to the modern age, but despite a small shower scene and a subdivision of the fake Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by that mysterious old vulgar. A woman chooses E.P. Wake up on the beach and then start controlling his life - he does not seem to care! Dick Sargent faces difficulties in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Valle (!) Are trying hard to be Elvis leaders (it highlights the moon). Some songs are very good, especially "Almost in Love," but if you want to watch the movie "Comedy for the Sex" more flexible and faster, look elsewhere. When Elvis and his killer attraction collide with each other, there is already a wooden board between them! be realistic. ** from ****
