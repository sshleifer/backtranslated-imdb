Gorgeous cast is wasted on the worthless script. Gathering ten adults or so in the summer camp they attended as events. Could this have happened a million years ago? It's just a fantasy, and it's boring. Do they become teenagers again? Do they run pranks, games and good times? They may try but in the end the answer is: no. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? horror? comedy? None of the above. How can anyone be entertained by this drivel out of my will. I wanted to love this film; I tried to love this film, but my mind refused.
