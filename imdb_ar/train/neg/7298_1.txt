The ransom characteristics can not be expressed. I hope I can get back my time. The beautiful skull faces are really wide smilies, shining in the camera when the disease has already already hit enough bad script. I was happy (the spoiler) to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end, especially party supporters who drink polluted juice on their way to the alleged sunset. Eleanor Roth shines for maybe ten moments, and puts on a theory about how much grass weeds in the woods when others spoil beer consumption. In general, I found that most of them are useless, but not without gratuitous violence or enough nudity, I am happy to witness the demise of the cast, in a way, wishing this trip never happened (perhaps I should have been put instead of watching TBS late night, Lav.).
