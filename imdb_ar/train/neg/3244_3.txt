The impact of this story on a psychologist involved with deceived artists is so polite that I have to assume that this is the desired goal. The groups are artificial and I never felt I was watching a movie. It seems that the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to each other. Although the film contains elements of noir film early (except that it is in color), the style is so exaggerated that I must conclude that it is a spoof of the genre. <br /> <br /> Do not appeal to me, at least I would expect an attractive story. I'm usually slow to absorb when it comes to stories with intrigues of plots, but you can see what would have come here within the first fifteen minutes. By the time of "Guy, I forgot eighty thousand dollars", I thought to myself that this thing is really ridiculous. For an experienced psychiatrist declared in gambling addiction to act stupidly he is beyond belief. If you acted at any stage as a smart intelligent person, the entire story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This wooden production left me cold.
