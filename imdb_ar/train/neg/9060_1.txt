Browse the channel and caught this on the LOGO. It was one of the moments "I have to watch this because it's very bad moments", like Roadhouse without a joy. The writing is awful; quite trivial and bad representation in your mouth. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget and then there is the abyss where this epic should be thrown and not seen again. I mean that the main characters go to a ski haven in some rented houses, and the cottage is ordinary, which is not big, but they choose to show all the houses that flow on it as if they were the Sistine Church. I'm sorry, but I watch 6 young men staring at every boring 10 Ã— 10 'room with a futon in it, and the labyrinth flows. I think they did not learn anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training. yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy them everywhere, so everything goes routinely. If it smells like ... it seems ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like plague. <br /> <br /> Edit: It seems that other reviewers more close I think that since the film hated, I "clear hatred" I can not imagine but I mean that I am a terrorist, and this of course is not true. I decided to do this strange and crazy thing and to judge the film based on the actual content of the film and not just its existence (ie it is refreshing to see ...) <br /> <br /> Sure, it may be refreshing to see but this is not equal in a wonderful film, Just give them some of the best materials to work with more tighter guidance. In fact, I applaud this effort. Honestly, the best to go to listen to the catalog is the characteristic kitchens instead of watching this again.
