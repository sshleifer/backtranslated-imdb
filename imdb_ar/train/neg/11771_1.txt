This appeared as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, but for reasons that left the best to existing forces. It seems that much has been achieved by the fact that it is the first Thai-language film, made from Thai actors and crew, but directed by a Westerner. I do not need to be honest, because this film is boring, boring, boring. Why do you hint at something, why an idea shrouds in mystery, and why you conjure up passionately, when you can reach the main point with horrifying sound sounds, clear shots and above the top scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination as a director and again Spurrier violently comes out endless clich√©s to her. No tip, no guess, everything on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder when it's coming "scary"? No, it will not cause the soundtrack to be more and more frightening, culminating in an ominous climax. Hell, I make up words to describe how bad this is. I wonder if the devil is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it really is a snake, and yes, it really shows the crotch, and there is a splash everywhere. It is a strange and uncomfortable film for several reasons. It is supposed to be a horror movie, but it is not scary - the vibrations are clear and clear. This may be a tough attack on the first side of Thailand, but the director enjoys a slippery approach when it comes to barely showing teenagers. Perhaps he portrayed himself as a virgin taking virginity that planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe everything was just pants. Uninspired, uneducated, repetitive, intruders - all candidates for the best description, but seems dull the most appropriate and honest. Everything has been seen before, maybe better, often with more thought, and rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Excellent on every count. Really terrible.
