Try very poorly in the spine tap. At least the music in the fork was good. <br /> <br /> It is really a very sad case of Hollywood favoritism at worst. A group of Hollywood executives, musicians and bad producers create some "poopie" shows so that their children can be in the spotlight. I beg you!!! The potty humor was bad. I hate these things when there are incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) piercing their heels to succeed and come this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Help everyone !!! Why was not Jim Simmons in it ?? Ameriac taste in leisure walks in the toilet.
