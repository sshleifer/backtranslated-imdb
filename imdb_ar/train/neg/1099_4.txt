I was shocked by the unbelievable Tiggerland conspiracy. It has been a liberal imagination about how the army should be. It was hard to swallow the dialogue along with the ridiculous things that allowed Colin Farrell to get out of it by his superior officers. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason why the boot camp is difficult, it's tough, it's supposed to encourage soldiers to fight and turn them into one cohesive unit. I was rooting for Booz to be kicked in the butt because he had such a danger to his fellow soldiers. I do not want to fight alongside someone like him in the war because he was more interested in people's feelings than doing what is necessary to protect his unity. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
