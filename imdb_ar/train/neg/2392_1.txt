We've actually seen this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we missed something ... No, what we missed was missing from the start of the pre-production phase. I have already returned to Robin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting in the day was now undesirable and much undesirable. > So, the initial problem in the film was to make the decision at all, and the rest of the wreckage of the train evolved from there. Nothing works at all - not something blessed. Some beautiful exterior photographs are moved by placing the camera in random shots. All actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickinson seems positively fond of it - with the exception of Ryan Phoenix, who gives the impression she is so unconscious that she does not realize how terrible her performance really is. The dialog box is a long, fixed loop. The scenes are not logical from second to second, and the relationship between them does not exist. Still, the film stumbles blindly, convinced that he is saying something profound. <br /> <br /> This is too bad to be funny; Gus Van Zant made other good films that encourage you to see them, and I'm glad he survived (and apparently learned from) this mess.
