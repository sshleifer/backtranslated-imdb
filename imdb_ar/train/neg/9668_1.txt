1940. - A visit to the Jewish ghetto of Lodz, occupied by the Nazis, recorded by a German cameraman with the covert cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with footage from the archives and clips from international news, and excerpts from relevant cultural films depicting world Jews such as scammers and parasites. This documentary explains Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A clear and unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I find this film very scary and insulting. One can only hope that such images will never reach the screen again.
