Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> When the Jehovah's Witnesses refuse his own documentary about movies ?? Or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although he is much smarter than Paris Hilton (and I know, not so hard), Zizik's mouth beats as well as hers, which is a completely different kind. It combines the worst of all his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are renowned for providing the expert b * lls *** comfortable with a lot of space to create unverifiable theories, rants without beginning or end, and linking concepts almost indiscriminately, in the process of misusing English by creating an indication of mixing the mother can only love. For example: there are three main brothers of Marx, hence the idea of ​​"wonderful" to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the ego, the ego and the super ego. I am very surprised that he did not play a piece of "Snowhite" and make a similarity between the Seven Dwarfs and the Seven Levels of Hiding (Muslim Hell). It is like the "number 23" hypothesis of Schumacher: play numbers long enough, and you can reach any kind of theory of the desired kokami, so linking the ancient Greeks to the death of Princess de. <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertaining element to TPGTC: Watching crazy crazy sweat like a pig during the pronunciation of disguised phantom chants because intellectual analysis can be a lot of fun. Why do you see "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other crazy drama when you can get Zizek for more than two hours? It's like watching an amusing train wreck. It is recognized that it is almost laughable on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I have always been puzzled by people who are trying hard to raise the film industry to social science. Giving stupid films like "birds" this idea, and then this great credit, may create his creator laughter in his grave. The primary fact is that the vast majority of films have no intellectual value, and that few films that have some intelligence do not require a philosopher who turns to shrink to draw a map to understand it ?? Unless one is a complete fool. Zizk sees layers and layers of meaning in most regular films. The hallucinogenic drugs should be famous and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> When Zizk showed the bathtub opening in the "psychological" shower scene, I thought he would say something about the black holes in the galaxy; how to drain life from the stars just like The bathtub hole sucks in Janet Lee's blood. Or perhaps he could tell how the hole represents my vagina, with blood flowing to it instead of exiting (as in menstruation), and this represents a kind of "smart paradox." When we talk about it, the real irony is that if Hitchcock has put that thought too much into every scene (and scenario), his films will not be the often elusive, irrational foolishness. The point of similarity in this bathtub opening was to show how easy it is to improvise about "hidden and deep meanings". When you add Zizek's fantasy of philosophy and psychology, putting these terms at the forefront of such simulations as wedding cake decorations, you get distracted jokes that can immediately affect uneducated - that is, easy impression and naive. <br /> <br /> Zizek makes a number of funny things (unintentionally) here, one of the most ridiculous ideas when Anthony Perkins's clean cleaning of the blood-stained bathroom is "with good work, good work." Do not laugh ... Hitchcock and the Psycho writer could never have enjoyed the idea that Perkins might enjoy a good job - cleaning a bloodied toilet - while they were imagining / directing that scene. He talked about putting words in a person's mouth (dead), but in the context of misinterpretation what the director had to say. "<br /> <br /> I like the initial ideas of Zizek about the wonderful" Solaris "for Tarkovsky, but then to destroy the good impression Nader by dragging "anti-feminism" and another nonsense in his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's position toward logic is the dog's attitude towards his plastic bones. "I just want to play with her all day!" Logic has its rules, He is being raped - at least not publicly - by his ilk. He seems to consider logic, evidence, common sense, and mind as enemies or just throwing toys; concepts to be avoided, twisted to fit the target Zizek is an HDS LSD, and all of his favorite films are his own 2001 "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses excessively on two of the most overrated directors - and films that are often her films The LACK's intelligence, if any, like Hitchcock and Lynch, only reduces its already low credibility: De Palma was surprised that he did not appear more prominent; this is another lame exit who writes incompetent texts.Zizek has a field day with Lynch's Lost Highway. There are many interpretations of this film, just like the people who watched the film. <br /> <br /> Zizek comments that the viewer easily accepts the "Loud" physical setting of von Trier's "Dogville" Anna Snicker. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek not only makes things happen while facing him, but also engages heavily in the obvious "bleeding". Like all sociologists, the oxymoron wraps a very vulgar "observation" in the expression (if it is full of spitting) and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology works exactly the same way: it makes us think we hear something new in fact, which is really what we all know, but we know it eloquently - which fools the most observant listener. <br /> <br /> I was expecting men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and tie him in a pink robe ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizk: Soon you were chasing in a children's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateeyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
