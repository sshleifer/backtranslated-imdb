Stromer's past was a revelation, but in general it felt like a crash. Camp stories work better on the camp's relationship. There were too many old and boring stories of friends in addition to a very large number of stills. I love the Clash and Joe for not consolidating and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document has left me wanting ... to communicate more The use of storytellers without a proper explanation of who tells the story alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummer's 'radio DJ voice' did little to glue the film together. Can anyone explain all the flags flying behind the scenes? After the terrible "Filth And The Fury" I hoped Temple could achieve. Joe Stromer's document deserves the best.
