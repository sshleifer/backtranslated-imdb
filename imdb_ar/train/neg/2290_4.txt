The ultimate goal of Big Brother is to know what to think about before we think about it. Is it a kind of miracle, or a sinister joke, that people do not wear direct mental outfits of their will, twist themselves into crooked shapes, and smile like monkeys? Movies, art, no longer risking the unknown, but are drawn from oblivion, drained of life. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a poor case story, suitable for a female student course. "See how women are discriminated against, abused, mistreated, and then dumped on the trash pile by a male-dominated society," she said. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, presumably, was a "pin queen of 1950," ass millions of men tossed to. (All critics repeat this phrase, "queen of the pin in the fifties", such as the monkey choir.) Its history as a familiar American sexual bomb: its south, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this film naive, unaware of the innocent of the great interests they serve and benefit shamelessly. Although she believes in Jesus, she enjoys naked shame in front of the camera lens - American males are supposed to imagine homophobic homosexuals. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of writer Mary Haroon herself, educated at the University of Oxford and a former Moroccan (do you smell common rot and "pity" as I do?): "I feel that without feminism, I will not do that .... "I do not make feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I find that women get my films better." What a warm group. <br /> <br /> The film extends to the narratives of the story of human life. The subject and purpose were postponed and postponed long before the film began. Mrs. Big has her boyfriend, but we do not show anything about their relationship. In fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> One can not ignore its amazing simplicity. In New York, where Mrs. Page tries to do her best to conform to the man's world and to allow him to allow herself to be tied in the ropes of slavery and put her tightly in black leather shoes and S & M, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where she goes away from everything, happily takes off her clothes and is portrayed as a "liberating" woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> Like hell, Aaron does not "make feminist films" or "do something ideological." Ideology has become very internal, supposed to be programmed, so that it is almost invisible. The older brother must be smiling.
