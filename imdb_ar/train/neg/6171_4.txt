Okay. This was no surprise. Many people will tell you this is Dream. But they all talk "shiztz" this movie is too slow. <br /> <br /> Starting with someone who makes a toast because of the pain he calls "my son" there are some wonderful scenes but I found them a kind of weakness. You may skip 40 minutes from the movie and reach the eyeball scene which was amazing and surprising. There are some really stupid scenes in this. They were applauding the blows and slapping with a fake stupid whistle, making me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep searching for hunting dogs. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you want a scene that will end in 20 to 10 minutes and which is still not surprising and has a random view of the man who is trying to rape his mother .. yes this is strange.
