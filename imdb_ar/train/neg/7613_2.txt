The small town of Diablo, California, suffers from mysterious deaths after General Robert Lopez discovered an old box. The two daughters of the two Sharifs, Dominique and Marie are battling with the bloodthirsty evil devil, "Diablo legend" is an absolute rubbish. The film lacks horror and anger, acting is amateur and the trend is bad. About the movie I enjoyed. I am a big fan of independent horror, for example I liked "Torched", "Live Feed" or "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" was misled. Definitely one to avoid.
