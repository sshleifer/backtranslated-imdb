To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this film consists of 80 minutes of distorted characters either drinking alcohol or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor is not funny and all the characters are female idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy, who believes that drinking is cool, women are determined to please men and all who oppose this view are geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with original American pies, other than a few names and Mr. Levinstein, a minor character in this film. The only good thing about this movie is the nice-looking girls. You do not see this movie and do not be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it is obviously overpriced and not worth anything higher than 2.
