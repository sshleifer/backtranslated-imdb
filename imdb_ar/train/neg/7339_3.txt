Maya is a woman without any interest. She dreams only of her life and wonders why she does not feel good about her. This can be an interesting topic. That would need a good story, wonderful preparation and good dialogues. She does not have any of these. This film is totally boring. There are only lengths and no peaks. The only peak is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of it, I could not take it. So he can not get out of this movie. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you're an Art-house fan or like it slowly, you might want to watch it. It's not funny, it's not fun, it's unattractive. My recommendation: do not see it.
