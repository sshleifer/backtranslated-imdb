I went to this film and I expect a short film about Sam's influence on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to have to throw more garbage on racial tension, mob justice, or the inability of the average citizen to choose under the pressure of his peers. He gave me an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective if it was in 90-minute format with greater focus and fewer sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Don 't cost yourself the trouble of renting a video unless you enjoy the enthusiasm of Spike Lee; in such a case, the theater is worth it. This is not a life story.
