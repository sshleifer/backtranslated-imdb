Definitely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions! Opponents of this view may argue that this title should not be judged by the same standards as others, because it is an independent film with a low budget, but already? The spirit of innovation and meager innovation is appalling. <br /> <br /> You agree with everything that has been said about this film, for example the mind that is weakly weak (when that's a bad thing, you take another step in filming the scene, God damn it), the thing I found The most disturbing is the complete lack of common sense in the script, assuming there is something like that during production. There was a clear absence of dialogue with respect for the viewers. The girls changed their personalities several times, and apparently they never showed any vocals for rationality or even brains - five relatively young girls against a simple mentally ill woman ?? The gang on it, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered an invasion to some extent for this title is that the camera does not leave the truck at any time, so the viewer sees everything inside it - which, like the rest of the film, Scary. <br /> <br /> ?? Oh, by the way, this movie is not like the Witch Project, Cloverfield or anything else that was shot with a handheld camera? This is an effect and not a feature! They can be used intelligently for breathtaking purposes, but in this case they are an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
