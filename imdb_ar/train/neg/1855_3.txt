This is the most serious film I have ever seen, but in all fairness, it is a wonderful and somewhat funny scene. I do not think filmmakers wanted to be the quality of typical Hollywood movies. It is just a stupid film about a serial killer being dyed in a load of toxic waste, leading to interaction with it and snow (as in the middle of winter). Then turns into a killer snowman and enough to make you laugh at himself. This film is really stupid but funny. The killings are fun. I did not advise you to go and buy it (as I did - the cover looked good!) But if it happened on television one night and I was awake laughing, he kept smiling.
