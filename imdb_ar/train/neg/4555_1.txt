This film failed to capture any of the mystery and intrigue offered by the book. The main point of this book is barely addressed, which makes the viewer wonder why everyone has made this big deal and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> The personal development is not good at all. Do not leave any background or personal development The audience does not care at all about what happens to them, so the sequence of events falls. <br /> <br /> The search for manuscripts ends abruptly, without any real explanation, and leaves no feeling of complacency about what the whole research was about. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst changes in the book I've ever seen. It is appalling and time consuming. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and read it. <br /> <br /> It seems as though the purpose of making the film is to discredit the book, and that is how bad the film is and its scorn. It's also a disgrace, because it would have been good if they had benefited from it at the height of its success, and they might have been able to get a good scriptwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please wear and waste your time, read the book!
