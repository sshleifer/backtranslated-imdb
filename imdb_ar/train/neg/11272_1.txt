The first movie I had to get out of. It was a preview of the crew and crew (not that I was involved, and rushed to add). I managed to do it during the first hour, so I think I'm qualified to comment, but that was the limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did this happen to any kind of quality assurance. It was the accumulation of the worst in the dialogue, an example of wooden representation and horrific casting, wrapped together without plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's photography was very strange. It has the worst Russian dialect in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> As she left the screen, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. Obviously they could not sit back again either. <br /> <br />
