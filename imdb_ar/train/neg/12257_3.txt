"It's not like that big mechanical game," says one early figure, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" just wants to get a masked monster like the Sharks series "Jaws". In other words, the special digital effects of this movie are awesome. The acting and output are not much better, either; they seem more suitable for a foul odor remover or bubble gum advertising than a horror film. The position of the people who worked in this film shows disdain not only for this genre, but also for the audience. "You liked" this film encourages filmmakers to make more of these waste, further destroying the kind of bad horror. (* 1/2)
