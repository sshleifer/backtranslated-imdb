The twin brothers at birth (due to the death of their parents) unite after 25 years to avenge their parents and recover their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact operates in two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the conspiracy of Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme while the wicked twin brother is just as embarrassing as the good twin brother. The sequence of events was not exciting this time, and Jean-Claude relies more on shooting and then on martial arts. Supporting support is wasted and within two hours the film is boring. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
