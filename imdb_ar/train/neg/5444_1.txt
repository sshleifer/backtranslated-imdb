It was 1974 and starred by Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> This alone tells what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a film. According to the film, Slovik reformed, got a good woman, and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In fact, Slovik may have been innocent naive, or perhaps only wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who was Slovik had or was not to decide history, but this movie was dealing with candy at a time when the state was wondering why its fight, the film took the two sides. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the soldiers who were in Viet Nam both in 1974 (as Willie Nelson says, let's say the truth, it was about the Vietnam War, not World War II), EoES was as propaganda as Jung Ho was in his forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik stated his position, which is simple and simple. He had a neurological problem. Heck, I have a clinical neurological condition, trust me, if I have done a military duty, there will be no problem for me, either to let go of my nerves and fail in my duties and get the grades or answer the KP or the toilet duty without a problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe that Teleflick, Slovik had no choice, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I have learned that movies from this decade or decade, in dealing with service or military service, will largely take the same position over and over again. <br /> <br /> 1940 and 1950, serve your country. <br /> <br /> Sixties and seventies, mock your country. <br /> <br /> This is history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to be Hollywood for me. He refuses to serve, and only when he is restricted until he is executed, does he show his passion. <br /> <br /> This emotional anger could easily have served his interest in announcing his neurological state, but it is clear that the film wanted to portray him as a human being and only when he was about to die became sad. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the cold tale of Mary by Ned Betty and the gloss in the end, with the Lord's Prayer, was as funny as if they were trying to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie can be seen without realizing it was directed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope everything is worth it for Slovik and anyone who chooses to follow suit.
