Shame really - I rarely watch a film and left I feel frustrated in the end. I've seen quite a number of adaptations Ira Levin - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and I liked them, but that did not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> When I read the outline plot - the award-winning playwright Michael Kane decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and steel his scenario for his success - I was excited. I love thriller films, Michael Caen is a good actor, Sydney Lumit is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but all I see is that there are a lot of twists and turns. Much of its kind is difficult to explain the line of a movie plot in detail, without giving up. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns and started my interests and fun at this stage. Although I should give Lumet credit in the very comfortable end that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Key actors Michael Keane, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon, and Irene Worth were all fantastic in their roles. . Although the Russian accent of the fake counterfeit is obvious, I have a little bit of nervousness (nothing personal to Irene, I think a fake tone from any actor will upset me). I'm not sure if Cannon's character is supposed to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to be swayed in watching this because of my views - give it a chance, you might want it, it may not. All about the opinion.
