After watching the film, the first question that came to my mind was: Is this supposed to be ironic or not? After reading some comments about the character of Doc Savage and the comic series, you know that this film was not meant to be an irony. So, tell us the story of a document American American super saves the Republic of South America from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this comes in a way that is so unrealistic that it becomes ridiculous. The end of the mandatory battle shows the worst martial arts show I have ever seen. The film may be interesting to low-budget film designers as a bad example.
