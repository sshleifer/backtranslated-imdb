I strongly agree with some other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and frankly misleading, misleading and harmful (at worst). Like others, this film was found to be a terrible mix of "real" science and counterfeit propaganda, the New Age. <br /> <br /> As a psychiatrist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True, I was not impressed by this film before, but her discourse on cell "consciousness" was one of the best examples of the term "consciousness" that has a predictable meaning for most people and its use in such a distorted way to cause ambiguity rather than clarification. It is an old Orwellian mentality that the Master described himself very well in his wonderful essay Politics and English. To refer to "consciousness" in this way - in fact, to refer to this film as "based in science" in general (which is its obvious goal) - is to use the language in the same way that Stalin used when the slave states called "democratic republics" His party described the movement of "socialist workers". <br /> <br /> I do not pretend to understand quantum physics. I know enough about this to know that in order to truly understand, it will take a great study. Ah, but we Americans love "instant enlightenment", and this is what this wrong film tries to accomplish. If you ask questions, it will be one thing, but it is clear that he is trying to ask and answer questions, which no film can simply do because we are very far from the answers (if they already exist). <br /> <br /> By the way, this film needs to morally disclaim the association of many "expert commentators" with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (TM), not to mention JZ Knight, who often speaks with her voice "Ramtha". (I am always surprised by this 10,000-year-old understanding of Atlantis about the concepts and terminology of the 21st century.) Again, this film argues that the past, the present and the future are all alike, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of a "good" and "bad" advice, so all my fault, not in Ramtha.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> such a mess.
