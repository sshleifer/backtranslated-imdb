This is the worst film I've seen in years! The ridicule begins and continues in the same way. I'm so funny when something happens in this movie ,,, and the representation is worse. It is slightly lifted by the end and the film is kept from flipping altogether. Mark and Burge are a bad actor in a bad film. Sorry Tim Burton was good but this one sucks.
