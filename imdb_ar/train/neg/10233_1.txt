When thinking about families, there are many words that come to mind. Among them: monotonous, uneducated, indifferent, unattractive, incomprehensible, and unacceptable. <br /> <br /> I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically cracking for Scream, but these new sights in the saw started to make those movies look like classic. Still tend to have the same demographics that other films have succeeded in achieving, but now they add a new level of degradation that makes girls between the ages of 12 and 14 years old feel they are militants and thighs. This movie is a boring load! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been attached to anything good since 1993! However, I am still amazed to learn that it has nothing to do with something bad! Was anyone surprised when it turned out that the interest in love in the film was one of the mental patients? Did not anyone know him when they first saw him? Only someone who has never seen in his life, watched another film!
