Okay. So I just returned. Before I start my assessment, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to love this film. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping I'd be surprised and actually go to the movie. I did not. <br /> <br /> It is not just the fact that all the imaginative cliches of horror exist in this. It's not just the fact that they make everything small in the panic jump (walking in a baseball bat on the ground?) Are you kidding me?). It just was not scary. One thing I was surprised by: there was more blood than I thought it would be .. that does not mean much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Donna, who left my mother Lisa with a house. They come in .. rise up on the top floor. The camera dies on her dead father on the couch. terrifying. I went to the top floor, where the scene of the baseball bat mentioned above occurs. He finds his brother on his bed and seems dead (how can you tell him? He did not have a spot of blood on him). Keller comes, Donna hides under the bed, and my mother dies. She works out screaming for help. The killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut for the treatment session. This is confusing to many people - everyone was wondering if her family had actually died or not, or imagined it, and said how nightmares began to come back. This was followed by the Filler dialogue. <br /> <br /> Cut to the chase very quickly. Some scenes in the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer already exists (for some reason, he ran away 3 days ago but the police / family were not even aware that it actually existed). Followed by more padding. <br /> <br /> I will not continue to talk about what happens in the film, because I do not want to spoil it much. If you want to know who died, Horror_Fan has already posted a post about this topic. But in the themes of death: it was not exciting. In fact people laughed at the theater loudly (an experience I had never experienced in a horror film, not even in the film "When Inviting a Stranger") during many of them. One in particular: the boy bus guy who gives the hilarious face "scared" I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisa's death, which was very rare. Her throat is inverted, and the blood (if you can even call it - was almost black) sprays on the curtain. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her several times after strangling her to death. I'm fine? The film was one of the most I've ever seen. Let's see here .. Mandatory document mirror curtain BOOM! Scene. Check. Twice, actually (you can say they are struggling). Support is mandatory even killer. Check. There's also a backup scene in the lamp, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want to scare the birds away? Well, I've got it! (Yes, they managed to merge one of those here). Of course, the scene we enjoy is the security we enjoy, but we are still running away from it. Do you go ahead? I can. <br /> <br /> For anyone who says the characters were not stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, although the huge alarm rings, literally say please evacuate the building, and 3 of my friends have lost, I will go upstairs to get my cellphone." These characters were the most flawed and stupid people ever. The only beloved character - Lisa - has made one of the most stupid movements in the film. "Oh, I just realized that the psychologist is here!" I must leave my strong friend behind me to run away to warn her Oh, shoot, the elevator slows down I think I'll take the stairs and run in the construction site! By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone ever regretted was her friend Donna (I can not even remember his name - is that bad?), And by that time, the audience had been completely drained of this vulgar movie. There were some pros - the disposition was fit for the most part and was good. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 1/5, and that's generosity. Just to laugh (and believe me, I had a few public), Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were spreading after the film ended, and their pulse was then very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.
