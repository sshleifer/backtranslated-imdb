This movie is one of the most I've ever seen. It is not just dialogue, it never ends. You'll think it's over, but it's not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never see him again. It seems like someone took a romantic comedy, took out comedy, then decided to downplay romance, leaving us a pile of crap that managed to get to the screen. But do not take my words for it, find out for yourself how terrible this movie is.
