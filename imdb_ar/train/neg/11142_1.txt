This is the worst piece of nonsense I had to watch - in fact it was so bad that I could not see it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is so bad it's fun! It's not close to the cute CGI animation in Spawn, that's how damaging it is, har har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the fact that some distribution companies have already put their money on this DVD, but I think They will get more money this way, because the cost of making it can not be more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It is so terrible that kindergarten class could make it. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh!
