Well, the reviews looked funny and I usually do not go to the movies on the opening night especially with my kids because you do not know well. Here's a movie that does not attract children or adults because jokes are very common for children and are completely flat for adult entertainment. I was really embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old son and had to explain to my 6 year old son what the H * T. Tantra is. What basically happens here is the holistic twisting of the classic Dr. Suss. He adds an evil neighbor and a cashier who wants to marry the mother of the child for her money. If this is a sub-plan, it may be fine, but it will end up being the main conspiracy around the entire film, and the Cat plays a more important role in exposing the neighbor to the mother than he really is. Take my advice and read the book and film.
