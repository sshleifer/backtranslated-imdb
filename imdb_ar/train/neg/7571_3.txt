A woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases Man (Joel Macriya as Kenneth) for the father (Charles Wininger as PG). The woman wants to make the man invest some of the deceased mother's money in the father's business project; however, the notorious father for the loss of money on the planned hair. No one knows anything, but the evil planners represent Man's best friends in order to steal his wealth ... <br /> <br /> Production seems appealing, but the story fails to get involved. Players do not play well drunk. The appearance of Brodrick Crawford first emerges - as Gopher "Hunk"; unlike the operation of missions, Mr. Crawford is installed on Earth by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Woman Chases Man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
