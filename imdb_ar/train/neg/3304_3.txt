Greentomb Grace is bankrupt after the death of their husbands until they turn into Ganja cultivation in order to pay the bills. This looks promising and does not disappoint Brenda Blethyn always but the material is very thin. There is already a scene where Grace asks her little gardener to "give me one" (tuk) and thinks he is asking for sex and behaving strangely. Yes, it is a humor until boredom nun. Grace's rescue does not seem to know what he wants to be: the stunning cinema and super-speed evoke the memories of his daughter Ryan, while the whims of a vibrant rural city can be moved from any episode of the promotional campaign. It speeds up after the first hour but by that time, it is fashionable to take care. Peak is unpredictable only by offering de ex ex Machina the most shameless that I have ever seen.
