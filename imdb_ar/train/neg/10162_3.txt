This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. I thought it was wonderful because it was very real, "exactly what people do in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from the area and watched the movie as "just the way people think in California!" I have lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and have worked there minimum wages there. We laughed a lot, enslaved us and took breaks with the people of our time; young people came out together at night. The elderly had little spare time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and there is no gloom in the winter rain more than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Regardless of "if you live in a factory house you must be depressed," the story lacks any elements of magic, mystery or even a sense of panic. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst. It is doubtful that anyone who was oppressed belonged to a church, but if she had done so, he would probably make friends there. I have read reviews that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, nicer and thinner" but if that was the case, he would not appear. All we see is learning Martha's hatred of Rose for reasons that might apply equally if the three friends are the same age and sex. We see Martha feel neglected during the smoking sessions, leaving the loop when making social plans, using them without appreciation, and ultimately disrespect and hurt. <br /> <br /> Just one other thing: are you supposed to doubt it? Kill Kyle because he was once in a few panic attacks? Please. This takes a stigma against mental illness to a new level.
