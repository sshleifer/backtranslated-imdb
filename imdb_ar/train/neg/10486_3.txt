My main comment on this film is how Zwick managed to get reliable actors to work in this film? Cast impressive? Even for supporting characters, nothing really helps this film. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's veil almost made him worth it? What was Tom about? Have you lost a bet? The best veil of the film was Joe Isuzu, although it is classic! The premise is good. Basinger, who is struggling to exist as a lady, is making her way to the Vegas motel by setting up a hierarchy of cosmetics sales. This happens because Corbett's character is on her way to Vegas to deliver the Elvis suit to his ex-wife out of extortion. As they both make their way, they have a lot of running with Elvis on the way to the Elvis Impersonation Conference in Vegas. The FBI quickly gets involved and begins tracking down what they believe is a serial killer of Elvis. Unfortunately, the hypothesis does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, imagine you're back in the first row? When story lines and continuity is not really important. It's even more interesting to see Basinger look beautiful in her own Pink Lady clothes instead of wondering why she is not doing what she really does. The film tries hard, but in the end the road falls in a short way. In the end, filled with ideas that could have been theoretically funny but in practice were not funny. <br /> <br /> It was not the worst, but you might find yourself feeling leaving the building when you watch this ???? One does not say I did not warn you!
