"Feast of All Saints?" Where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Has the Halloween story been edited and edited? <br /> <br /> What a wonderful title waste! There is nothing at all in the story that has a distant link to "Halloween". There is nothing in the story of "every day souls" that the term refers to. Why would you be interested in using this address if you do not intend to include any story or topic about "All Souls Day" or "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Writing a bad script for amateurs and writing amateurs <br /> <br /> How did they attract this great talent for this claw? Writing amateur - characters who have known each other throughout their lives are engaged in long speeches about the great history of their lives for the public. Not at all how people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the manager's thinking? <br /> <br /> The route is just as bad! Pattern forced and very deliberate feel amateur. In one scene, there is a person shouting "lift your hands from me" and was not touched by anyone! However, the most poorly directed scene is the incredibly stunning battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Too much gore in a very difficult battle scene, <br /> <br /> There are lots of dead in the most fake battle scene. Sounds like a Saturday Night Live play !! You can see extensions waiting for their signals to walk through the camera. Everyone plays the scene of their death like the boys in the fourth grade - exaggerating in every few moments and tingling. The blood on the victims of the battle is extremely exaggerated and applied carelessly, and someone seems to be using the ketchup dispenser and putting straight lines of red in red on the costumes. <br /> <br /> The whole scene of the battle is like a parody of a cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride on a horse and make the finish line. <br /> <br /> Who will be in real life acting this way ?! <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl stands under the body of her hanging father - who is not terribly deformed, Serious wounds. So completely idiot to know that he has died! Yet they are - very monotonous - repeated over and over again "Papa, Papa ..." while looking at someone outside the screen. It has given a great deal of credibility and passion that you expect from an unrepresented child who has been repeating the line all day for cameras. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child has no acting skills, the scene is completely incredible. The small girl was not in the middle of the battlefield hours after the massacre - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while standing quietly there !! Natural instincts made the child scream and fear, running away from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be scared or laughing ...?! <br /> <br /> One particularly striking detail, which gives the scene an SNL spelling tone, is the hanging father, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. It's like a fish on a hook! Funny details inadvertently, make the entire scene fake and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, mothers and daughters of the same age! <br /> <br /> Other funny details are that you see a central character - the mother of the little girl - at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which happens after 20 years, looks forward to himself! She is still young and beautiful, and now in the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost closed the film there because the direction and writing were clearly shocking - but I tried to stick it because I wanted to see Louisiana settings and loved all the actors. I do not know what these fantastic actors were thinking when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> An excessive amount of blood and poorly behaved violence in the opening scene are strange to the place with the tone of the next soap opera novel. It's also a strange way to start a movie that seems to be for the rest of the time aimed at a romantic novel you read female. Contradictory strange in tone!
