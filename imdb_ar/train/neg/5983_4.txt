I was one of those "little Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Jerry Anderson. Thunderbirds was a great sequel at that time and it was possible to make a great action / adventure film if the writers were only able to know where they were targeting. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a great film, but I did not expect it to aim at such a low-age group. Such as Lost in Space, this may be both amazing and enjoyable. It should have focused on more of the movement / adventure and goal of the original series ... saving people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, Alan focused on saving the day instead of his brothers (who were also chosen) young anyway anyway versus the original). The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not care much about the original characters, but I was grateful to her in the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed Thunderbird for high-tech stories, and even that did not get as much screen time as I was interested. I would enjoy watching more great gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
