Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My colleague hired me in the room because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (a flick of some travelers trapped in a cave). So, we decided to watch it anyway I think it can not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this movie has already been produced and put to the public. It was terrible, it was like an accident scene where you want to look away but you can not make yourself. I honestly feel emotional distress. It turned out to be a low-budget film where a university girl was assaulted by a boy dating from a porn flick. And really not good. She went from a woman's rapacious hatred to a bad feeling for him. Approximate. All in all, a terrible film was rated NC-17 for some reason. Do not waste your money. Do not let your children see it.
