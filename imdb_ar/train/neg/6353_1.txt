For the comedian, Woody Allen really allows viewers who pay for this little attempt at personal development. There are a few amusing moments, but there will be more than one listening to falling tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Ferrell is wasting his time in this movie, which fails to display its normally funny connection. Amanda Pitt did well, but again, you do not have room to move in this body like a movie. The film is so heavy and heavy that it can not be carried, but if it is shown, it is done by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that go on in one scene and do not really accomplish anything but show that the writer can write a few lines of sudden dialogue at times, you will love this film.
