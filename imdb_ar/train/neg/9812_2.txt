The plot of this film was not only as busy as the two men could have kidnapped a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat; it was a terrible rupture of "misery." However, the main reason I was given such a low rating was that it was quite disturbing to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily dumbfounded because of what filmmakers make and I always had a horror horror flick but this film went too far in terms of violence and torture just to get points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people, when watching only the first 10 minutes of "hide and seek", will find themselves reaching the remote control.
