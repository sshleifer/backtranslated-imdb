Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has no films that produce works at all. <br /> <br /> You think that after these bleak clicks "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" he started to get the idea that he might not know what to do when it comes to movies (and many argue he does not know What he does when it comes to television, too). An attempt to produce feature films from a comedic welcomed by the third time the SNL channel made no sense. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like Tim Meadows, and I think it would be great in the right film. . It is shameful to see a talented young man lost in a film that presents an oddity after unfamiliar situations, and enriches them all with a scene of very bad songs and dancing. Any laughter here would be because the film is very bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can thank that there are many other tired SNL characters that will never make movies about them. . It is very bad that this one arrived at the big screen.
