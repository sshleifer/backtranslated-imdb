Polynesian male drinkers drink, and fight and make a series of stupid and unusual sexual statements. Polynesians in real life are more entertaining than these stereotypical characters. The supposed Samoan girl did not look or act Samoa at all, looked like a white femininity who had sex with anyone on a whim. With weak water story lines, you can not say anything about acting - even the most skillful actors can not do anything with this scenario. It is sad to see Polynesian actors wanting to play these sad stereotypes in a film that has not a good scene, and only two or three of the "jokes". What a waste of taxpayers' money in Kiwi, what a missed opportunity to produce a wonderful film about a vibrant society. It is better not to make films if they are bad or stray like this.
