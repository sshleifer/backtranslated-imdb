When many people say it is "the worst film I have ever seen," they tend to say that about a film they did not like. However, out of almost 700 films I can remember that watching this film is one of two films that went away from personal humiliation and anger. This is my first review of the movie, by the way, you sign up for IMDb just to rave in a bad state for this movie.

He leaves the fat loser at the altar, goes skiing weekend, meets with a blonde bomb who cares about him, takes him home to meet the family, they're all cannibals and he's the main track, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks all butts and escapes with a girlfriend Brother, and live happily ever after. vomiting. First, the gags are so bad that it took me some time to understand that they were trying to be funny, and that this was a comedy. Special effects, few of them, look as if they were 15 years ago. The dramatic ending was so great and so badly behaved that it was almost impossible to see (the entire cannibal family knocks on the grass, which stands in the pattern of Tom and Jerry when they step on it). I'm sure there are lots and lots, but I have no intention of seeing him again for the information.
