This movie is not funny - this is a waste of great stars, who seem to have fallen into their stars to forget. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as the manager of the hotel who loves to wear his clothes - almost fall off your seat with a helpless laugh when he dances to Donna's "little girls" while wearing high heels, mink coat and an elegant hat. Rest: Forget it!
