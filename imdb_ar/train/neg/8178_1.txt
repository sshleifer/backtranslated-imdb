Have you ever sat watching a movie when it passed 20 or 30 minutes and suddenly I realized that you had already seen the movie before? This is what happened to me with "young graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is very tricky. I swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points in this movie or ... it is simply junk junk. I lean heavily towards the latter but I think some have developed this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... The plot. Conspiracy. Let's see ... there must be a conspiracy here somewhere. No, I can not find it. This is largely the case of some high school seniors who act as dupes, use drugs and speak in a language that has become obsolete. One of the students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a rigid wife (already referred to as an iceberg) so he accepts the girl's progress. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of leadership around her, her hidden dialogue and lots of spastic dance. Katana, Bobo, was captured by high school kids who dance. I watched with amazing intensity as the dancers danced and shouted at the dance floor. It is good to see that at least one species has found something interesting in these effects. 10/01
