There seems to be an overwhelming response to this film so far no one has an insight into the systematic criticism, which is very flawed. He simply continues to publish the analysis of the journalistic approach, that he ignores the lack of knowledge and prejudice of the masses in order to provoke emotional condemnation and burst into a negative discourse. <br /> <br /> Press 101: Tell the viewer some truth just to prepare them to draw predictable results. For example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc., all have unexpected reactions to the collapse of government infrastructure after Hussein's death: were not they all symptoms of an already contagious culture? The sectarian fighting of the symptoms of these veins of Islam itself, rather than the failure of the police force to restrict and secure? Would they prefer the United States to declare the Marshal Act? I am sure that the newspapers here have exploded with accusations of a police state and a fascist force. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the analytical stupidity of the film, he takes a few of the absentees and leaves the rest out claiming "I have refused to meet them ..." but the questions they have asked are no doubt answered by hundreds of inquiries Individuals already. As Vice-President, you would like to interview an author / producer for the first time, who was definitely about to distort your words. They could not pass the Condi bar to actually show their opinion and answer some logistical questions, perhaps they never heard of it. <br /> <br /> This is far from a neutral view of the situation on the ground there. This is another biased approach, unspecified by journalists - which are largely herds, non-thinkers. <br /> <br /> Anybody who wants to comment on the war must rely on his ideas at least on things that are a little more reliable than covering NBC and CNN commentary. These interpretations affect the same vagueness that simply creates another party for those who want to think and those who want the media to tell them what they think.
