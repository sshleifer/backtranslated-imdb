I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that made me see it was that it was very bad and had some sort of entertainment. The hilarious movement of characters, from the excessive way they shoot, to their unbelievably bad behavior (were all the bad guys just out of the street, or were they actually actors?), To delivering incredibly bad lines to their actions Can not be explained (if you try to shoot someone through the entrance while entering, it is obvious that what you have to do is shoot directly on the knob !!). This movie should break some records for the worst written and introductions. <br /> <br /> The camera's work was also bad - you can barely see what is happening in the scenes of fighting because of camera switching and shaking. <br /> <br /> I voted "1" but I liked Chiba and composed by Su Shihumi, and I enjoyed a few scenes: 1) breaking the arm of the villain until the bones come out of the skin (this must be painful) 2) Who eat a brown animal by penetrating the carcass through a meat cutter. 3) Sony Chiba performs some impromptu eye surgery on a man with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm really a fan of Chiba but this is not really worth anyone's time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only films worth seeing (and fantastic!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I have also heard the hangman and Golgo 13 good. I recommend sticking to these.
