I saw this movie on a trip to American Airlines heading west. It was so bad making the trip look really longer. The plot had potential (who does not like a film about a woman who accidentally kills anyone who is Elvis's character)? But she has been distorted a million times differently by really bad writing. Near the end, an awkwardly embarrassing scene, where a gang of Elvis occupants on the roof of a casino look back at the sky and it will return, and then a group of stars move together to form the Elvis constellation, which instantly shoots lightning at the impersonators and sends them crashing through Roof. Bad ... really bad. It is the subject of the entire film. I would avoid this one at all costs.
