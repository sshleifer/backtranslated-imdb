After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see this high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" is a classic adaptation of lovable children, portraying the story of the smooth and brilliant protagonist Mr. Fox (or "Foxy") as he tries to steal one "final" robbery from the dreaded Buggins, between. That's right, one is short, one is fat, one is lean, or yet goes. <br /> <br /> I do not know very well where to begin with my money. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm in my late teens and I was not a fan of Rold D., but I liked his stuff well enough, having read some of his books as a child and I saw Matilda, Charlie and the chocolate factory again and again. This film, however, is struggling for an audience. Are children targeted? grown ups? I'm still not sure! A lot of "jokes" had a child, especially since Mr Fox was visiting a lawyer for example, or complaining about being poor. Also, the audience is expected to sympathize (I suppose) with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you see Mr Fox's work hampers his thumbs! Surely this is much? Well, the plot ... well, it's boring. I only stayed in the hope that the situation would improve, but instead I was more and more disturbed by Mr. Fox and his son Ashe for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> The humor, at the same time, falls off. I laughed once or twice only, although I knew specifically attempts jokes. I think part of it is that the vocal representation is incredibly flat and drab. The vocal actors have no sense of comic timing, and instead aim for the precision of humor that works only with some medium. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Merrill Streep does not show any emotion, I did not even realize that Bill Murray had a role until the end of the credits, Ash, 12 years old in the fox years, looks like thirty years old. <br /> <br /> I like animations, especially stop motion, but the visual style is a little creepy. The characters are long, spindle and lack any warmth in the design. They move with very little fluidity and are often jerky and exotic animation. There is also a distinct "mixed medium" feeling, where 2D components are added intermittently and unsuccessfully. The characters looked directly on the camera and spoke. It was very embarrassing. There was a moment or moments when Kelly looked directly at the camera, did not move and had whirlpools on his eyeball. He really scared me. <br /> <br /> Mr. Fox had a lot of potential. Many people still like them - see reviews. Maybe that was not the case for me.
