One scene illustrates the mentality of "Terminator Woman" well: Karen Shepherd and another woman trying to escape from the evil camp. Karen came across an armed guard who was pointing his gun at him, but after a few seconds he threw it and challenged it to fight. Karin kicked him in the balls, picked up the gun and ran away! Then again, when a movie is directed by a military artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know that you do not expect much. Karen Shepard and Jerry Trimble get some early amusing fun, and the film might turn out better if it focuses more on the love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes are separated, the film slows down in the crawl, and even with an occasional combat scene to stir things up, it lacks excitement. Conclusion Trimble fights Kissi inside a cave and Sheperd womano-a-womano goes against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a fast boat, but the battles overlap in a way that cuts off their flow and diminishes their value. On the plus side, a tribute to the fashion department to give Karen the opportunity to show the amazing split throughout the film! (* 1/2)
