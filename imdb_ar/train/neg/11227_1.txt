This movie was incredibly bad. I saw him during the San Francisco Film Festival 2004. Before the stage owner started up he told us how half of the audience left the theater the night before, which happened to be the "first world premiere." I do not think anyone in the theater might understand how bad the film is at this stage. We all understood by the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary even though it was sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and deceptive tribute to Bettie Paige, where half of the film is really just old movies from Bettie Paige. The film is 90 minutes long and the content is 90 minutes without a minimum. The scene will start and one of them says, "Wow, you're so wonderful, my house, why do not we make another film?" This will be followed by 5 minutes of the Bettie Paige edition which was almost ridiculous (and even more tedious than) the normal part of the film. By the end of the film, people were laughing every time a new version of Bettie Paige appeared. That was ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theater, but people did not laugh at the filmmaker, they laughed at the film and its meager content and structure. It was so easy because the parts that would get the most laughter were those that were supposed to be serious or inspirational. <br /> <br /> I know films are expensive. I have seen many cheap independent films but somehow the cinema and the quality of this film distinguish it from anything else I've seen. The film seems to be making for $ 12. The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensory plot made this an unforgettable experience. This movie makes "Dude, Where's My Car?" Looks like Ken's citizen. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater as if we had just paid $ 8 for torture. The only part of the experience was that we laughed at the fact that someone had already made this film and thought it was good. Apparently, the night before, the night of the First World Premiere, the director / writer / producer was in attendance and had seen people laugh and get out of the film. The films of Bettie Paige were destroyed. They must destroy this movie as well.
