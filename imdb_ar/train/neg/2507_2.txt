This is not a good film. She's disjointed, all actions are bad, she has a lame story that I've seen a thousand times do better anywhere else. Not to mention that you see every plot point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lunette Mackie that she could not sing. But who cares, it's sooooo damn good-looking. But I digress, nothing new here. The bottom line is to take advantage of the group of hot girls, some of whom hang on drugs, someone is related to a guy, one of them comes out of hell, and terrible things happen. What a surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe a lot of people think that this is a good film. Many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to classifying black movies. I do not play it! If you want to support these movies by going to see them - great! If you enjoy it - Super! All alone. But do not try to tell me it's good. Pleeeease! I hope that colored people do not hang on to such films just because they have black actors. Do you want to watch a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Beam. Or purple. These will be great films regardless of the actors' color. why? Because they tell compelling stories with wonderful representation, they made you feel a long way after you left the stage. Just because our experience does not make it a good movie automatically. It's just good - when it's good. interval.
