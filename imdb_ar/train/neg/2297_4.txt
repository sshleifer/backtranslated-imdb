I turn to 700 club once in a moment and I only agree with some statements made - I am one of the many faithful who are considered liberal by most Christians and conservatives by most non-Christians. I vote my opinion, usually no representative. Or Marka - I do not think 700 clubs tell people what they believe in, but it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative backgrounds. I think many people misunderstand what is said in 700 clubs. It bothers me to hear a name calling either way. I think 700 of the clubs really love Jesus, but they are very busy trying to get people to vote so conservatively that they forgot to show love to some people and to promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals who believe in Him and let us not be ignorant of our comments about them. Why do people mean it to each other?
