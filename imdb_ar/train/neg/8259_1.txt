I saw this movie back when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> It was based on the idea that children with autism could communicate with written messages with someone else who would only help them and guide their hands. Then suddenly these kids, many of them did not even watch the keyboard or screen when the letters were being written (they could look at the ceiling in some cases), but their supervisors had eyes sticky on the keyboard, started Write abusive messages from their parents and other people, sending parents and child care agencies into a tight, left and right atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The whole thing proved to be a fallacy when a third person presented the folder, opened it to the child and said "Write the picture you see", then when the presenter converted the folder to the supervisor, you would drop a fold to reveal another image Different. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the boy saw a dog, the supervisor saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time you thrive, the name of the picture is what the supervisor noticed, and never showed the child's back. <br /> <br /> So who was writing? The child was never. <br /> <br /> This movie has played a disastrous role, as stated in the Australia poster, where the person who harassed the child in the film was in a position to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert did not put her son in that place, he would not be harassed, the film says. He was better off under her supervision. <br /> <br /> If you hand my child over to your organization for help and get it instead, do you think I'll be careful to hear anything you say next? Improbable! I think it's a safe bet that all these accusatory messages were printed by these children, that this film was based on it, and they did not accuse someone in their operation, as happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the film performed very well from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic person, but otherwise, the film did not really do much. <br /> <br /> The worst was to write the baby on the end of Patty Duke, and hear the mechanical sound read what he wrote,. . . . . "We won!" This child has been molested. If I cut off my legs and took you to court and found you guilty of harming me, assaulting, whatever, this is legal justice, but it will not restore my legs. <br /> <br /> At best, in my case, I will see him as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> Whatever chance this child has of what he thinks is normal with autism alone, it has been further damaged by sexual harassment. <br /> The "normal" child has enough to cope with this experience. <br /> <br /> It is completely surreal to think that you should look at any situation and go "we won" if that person is found guilty. In court. <br /> <br /> Just bad handling of the situation and conditions along the way here.
