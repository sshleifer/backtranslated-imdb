Perhaps this is the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage regardless of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a very cool idea for the setup - the South American can provide a credible background for maximum reaction to the supposed misdeed hero tour. <br /> <br /> But execution! Widdoes is a very courteous Beatrice giving very bad performance. Waterstone, the good actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The weaker performance is the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. The desire to make it a cartoon-like villain that connects the virgin to the train track may fit suit with the chords of dog dogberry and his men - but acting makes you want to cringe. <br /> <br /> Successful formations include the scene in which they deceive Benedict to believe that Beatrice loves him - if the influential actor is wonderful. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict are coming very close. <br /> <br /> In general, I had to force myself to keep watching, but it certainly did not get my attention. <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the last comments above, I am nearly 40 years old. I've been watching Shakespeare's screenplay and screen for over two decades. I might suggest when trying to defend your friends to talk to the piece instead of attacking other reviewers when they are inadequately armed in terms of reality. However, I can assume, from your displeasure with young people, that you are old enough that the gentle disposition of the past days is more to your taste. <br /> <br /> My favorite favorite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on stage in London. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can work.
