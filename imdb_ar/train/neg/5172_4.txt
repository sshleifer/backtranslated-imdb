This is the second film I saw in Horrorfest last weekend, and Gravedancers is the first. The graves were better. I can only guess from watching this that production must be very limited. I will admit that the story has started to be interesting but it has already faded in the end. We did not really give time to empathize with or understand any of the characters, making each of its wrong characteristics more disturbing. I must mention that there was also a little misbehavior with a 12-year-old boy who works as honest. The only reason I was sitting in the whole movie was to find out what was the big secret, which turned out to be not interesting. It was possible to help some basic information about the family, but they did not really show a family at all to begin. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateurish that I could not see it put on DVD. The four categories are the primary potential that the story may have. This was one to skip to horror.
