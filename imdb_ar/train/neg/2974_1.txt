I am a nice guy and I like to consider myself tolerant with kind. I think that means that I am trying to think of a film in the context of the genre in which it exists. If there's nothing else, it keeps me from feeling like I have to say really bad things about people or movies, and that's what I do. Do not like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this drawing was quite clear, the production values ​​were very low and uhm, simplistic. Representation rose to the "good to play in high school" area from time to time. I felt that this was filmed in one day - please tell me it was. The "voice sound" that was not compatible with the motion (complaining of climate and screaming while lying on a bed slows a bra ???). Certainly there was no "edge" to it at all - there was nothing special or interesting, and with amazingly quick cuts. <br /> <br /> Sonic is "1", with the following summary statement: Better if the stripper material is expanded into the club filler, and the rest of the film is intense.
