Argentina. Mixed dinosaurs came back to bring out another bit of our mind in this horrible third film. This time, European terrorists (Irish people say) welcome a military convoy supposed to transport uranium. They withdraw to the shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends, the Karnosur. The visit comes when Dinous rubber strikes terrorists, policemen and some Marines. It seems that the entire film was (again) largely inspired by Alien (as was Carnosaur 2) where the pathetic Marines were passing through the "gorge" shipyard? Guns are on standby. This third composition may be the driest and most disturbing film in the film, with only one blood spurt when it cuts off a rubber head from the Marine Corps. Dynus is solid, mixing creatures as usual and T-Rex looks like an angry elephant when it's wasted (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the most horrific scenes of the film is when the stoppers reach the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some strange noise coming from another truck. On the opening, surprise! The gang of rubber reptiles exploded and devoured them. Why was Denus locked in the second truck after her escape from the first? How were they locked because the door of the truck can only be closed from the outside? What was the purpose of filming this scene ??? Hey bother, who cares? Both the thumb down for the rubber Iguana is more than the size.
