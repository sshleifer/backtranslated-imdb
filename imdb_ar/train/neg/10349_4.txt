First of all, I am a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was very excited to see a film of my favorite books, Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined this excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having a theoretical curl and glasses and an inappropriate mind. In the film, she has straight hair without glasses and is a "sports genre" with a deep voice. This is not the way that Madeleine Lengel Meg was portrayed to be at all. In fact, Meg was dependent on Madeline's character and imagined what she felt when she was small. This is just one major example of a different book and film. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle series in time, I suggest skipping this film.
