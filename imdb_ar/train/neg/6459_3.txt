These actors are as big as disappointment. Marlon Brando plays his terrible character, the film is not funny at all, can see a conscious message "It's a bad game!" So. Is simply disgusting and annoying. In addition to the foolish plot, the humor, there is something else. The way to decorate rooms and colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. I usually do not care about the decoration in the film, but this of "Free Money" angered me. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Chen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer gets nothing! One sees it at the expense of reason.
