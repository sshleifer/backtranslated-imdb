Everyone has been a while since, Disney makes a movie that surprises everyone. One makes you wonder until the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie is sure to turn into a ghost, killing and raping your village. It's terrible. If you want a mindless, meaningless, "motion" movie, go ahead. I think young children may enjoy this, as they always like when Good Good always wins. But I love the movies where the winner is throwing. This movie does not always allow bad hands. In the end, when the heroes leave the hole "inevitable", you know that they can come out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, and he never has to think of a puzzle or idea for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complicated. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive designs, not if you want to see good acting, or good film. Go to watch Superman movie, it will be much shorter, children love it more. For example, the scene in which Cage escapes armed gunmen, and all the bullets deviate by way of an escape escape. (I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just ONE LITTLE POLE) This film depicts the degeneration of films and the film industry into the cheap gags and tedious, unrealistic actions that this film offers in huge quantities.
