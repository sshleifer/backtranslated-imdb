Yesterday I saw Flyboys and my friend told me it was the worst movie I've ever seen ... Since I thought it was so bad, it made me think - any movie was the worst movie I've ever seen and it was the only movie that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's been two years since I've seen him, but I remember the dreadful eater Dean Ken as a cocky man in the army (a lovely boy Ken does not do very conceited) Well. Exotic deal with a CGI helicopter When renting a helicopter is cheaper than hiring some CGI to manufacture it, but I think they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI programs or the son of the product. I love playing with his new computer. And how do they look? Sei. When the dragon moves through the corridors of the compound, reusing the same footage over and over - looks very cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really horrible ...
