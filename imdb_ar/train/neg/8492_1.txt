If you succeed in getting opening credits, this may be your movie type. From the first picture on the screen of a woman holding her hands on her face with white leaves blowing in the background, one remembers a commercial ad for perfumes. It's rainy from there. <br /> <br /> The main actress is basically a block of wood used to access her computer to the past and reconstruct memories of photographs, to talk with the genius of neglected history, Ada, who designed the first computer language in the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Low-budget graphics will be forgivable if they are interesting, or even fairly indistinguishable from script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
