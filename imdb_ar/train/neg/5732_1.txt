I am all about horror film "Bad" but this was just a pile of dogs! How anyone can call this cool or decent movie is beyond me. If you want accelerated editing to cover special effects, bad behavior and bad texts, go! There was no suspense at all, and the humor factor was funny because it was very fake. I'll have a hostel or a Wolf Creek on this heap any day. My partner surrendered after about 20 minutes and she knew Natna when she saw one. On the other hand, I sat stupidly throughout the entire film just to wait and see if it had improved. There is no such luck! I did not film his other film Meshal and I doubt if I will bother now.
