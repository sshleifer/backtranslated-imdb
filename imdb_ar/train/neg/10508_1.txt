I thought that a rare horror film was made with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This film makes it look like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" compared to this piece of sordid and undemanding stool that has the audacity to label itself a film. I'll write more, but I'm still angry that I was stupid enough to spend Â£ 3 on hire, reels. <br /> <br /> Were these English people? Where are the woods? I have lived in the UK two thirds of my life and as far as I know there are no dark, dark forests in the central regions. Everything seemed bally like a coniferous national trust farm. These angels looked like appetizing porn stars (mostly turned, do my research). However I was a little impressed when Jude was exposed to the sectors. <br /> <br /> P. I love and liked Tom Savini, but I can not do it
