Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, I and a friend decided that he had set absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the film that could have been worse than it was. To this day, we still classify films, even very bad films, by knowing how much better than "the only lady." <br /> <br /> A long time ago, I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the script. For, among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife," she asked her to write a script for Harold Robbins' The Only Lady. She said she had sent a treatment and was rejected because they did not think she understood the difficulties of a screenwriter in Hollywood. "I think they asked someone else to write it," she said. The interview was filmed before the film was released. I died in 1981, and bet that the first thing I did upon her arrival in Paradise was personally thank God for saving her from participating in the result.
