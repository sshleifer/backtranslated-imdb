This TV movie shows that bad films exist. The only reason I saw is that it was covered on KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, do not play any football at all, we see from behind the scenes do not look at anything basically. With so many stars in this film, no difference. I really do not know why I saw this.
