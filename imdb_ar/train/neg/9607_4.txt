Do not listen to the misleading title "The Werewolf Woman". It is known that Europeans focus on sex and nudity on the real horror in their horror movies, but this film is very much here. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a labyrinthine sex scene that has been stopped with the appearance of the character's nickname of madness and the brutal murder of her partner. Fun in the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes monotonous very quickly. Not even a wolf, but the schizophrenic chick who hanged his predecessor because of lactans. The film can not decide its tone. The first 10 minutes (flashback) are a horrifying miraculous horror (I thought I was in a classic trash film afterwards) for a somewhat bad personal study of female victims of abuse and torture repeatedly to the movie Revenge. In the end, the director insists that this depends on a true story. Yes, well. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some entertainment aspects of production. Wicked woman title is a viewer and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become monotonous fairly quickly. Also, the dubbed dialogue is a very hilarious way camp, especially the most likely doctor in the world (drinks at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes irritated. There is no actual conspiracy or anything else really. It is shameful, because reading the description I felt that the film has some real potential. "Woman of the Werewolf" is too long, slow to move, useless, even by exploitative standards. (10/4)
