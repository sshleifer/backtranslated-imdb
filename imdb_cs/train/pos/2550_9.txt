This is really one of the "golden age" in Hollywood, which is no longer doing so. It's a unique fun movie that lets you guess what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly busy and all are great supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman, and since then I've been his fan. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite actor and has added a certain quality to every film he's in. Although he played another character here, he still added something to the film that another actor cast in this character should not be added.
