Those from the "instant satisfaction" era of horror films undoubtedly complain about the pace of this film and the lack of free effects and number of people. The fact is, "Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be performed. If you avoid the independent stands because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty people, a baddie whose story might come from the back of Chocula's Box, "Empty Acre" is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Set yourself in the decaying remnants of a country-style American dream, "The Empty Acre" is the story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of a six-month-old child. As the weak relationship of the couple breaks down, a bigger story takes place in the background. At night, the formless dark matter excludes sunless roasted barren acres on their farm, and seemingly absorbs anything on its way, leaving no signs of it ever being. The film is filled with mysterious signs and visual traces of what is going on, ending with a well-done end that resonates with a sufficient number of remaining questions to verify the writer / director's belief in the intellectual audience. There seems to be a subtext about the death of the American dream, but I would hardly call the film of allegories. Riveting, well acting and technically clever, "Empty Acre" is a fantastic little indie that lovers of horror fans would love.
