The family Matho Spirogola (Toby Malone) knows he is a talented footballer and is pleased to secure a bankruptcy to enter the big club. I hope that when he comes to the city, his cousin will take care of him. But cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: a naive breed farmer, a second streetwise lost, who managed to get mixed with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening before his big day. When he arrived with his cousin George (Damien Robertson) when arriving in town, Mat encounters other difficulties when a young biker takes him on a journey more than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in the theater, delivers praiseworthy performance as a bucolic teenager. There are clear signs of a low budget, but like many other low-budget movies, it's more fun, seemingly more spontaneous and more spellful than the average Hollywood blockade.
