I admit that the first time I watched Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I did not think it would be very rare in every respect. But now, after examining her seventh, I admit that she has grown too much for me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and Countesses have become very nice. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean is very nice. Although the conspiracy is very weak, I think satirical humor is more than compensated. Then there is a kick-ass soundtrack, which represents an incredibly talented K.D. Lang (which reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) in her best form. I can not think of any movie that "grew up" after an unfavorable first impression, just like the Cowgirls.
