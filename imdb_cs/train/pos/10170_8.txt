In full contrast to the second review, this movie was really surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it, expecting to be bored with clich√©s, obvious jokes and overtaking, all of which promised a trailer. But after 5 minutes I actually smiled and enjoyed refreshing acting. With the only humor of "toilet humor," Over Her Dead Body managed to really come up with realistic entertainment scenarios and without spoiling anything, some of the moments involving the animals are cheerful. good film are all; script, director, and actors, and comparing some recent recent attempts on a romantic comedy, this film is tall. Surely, you will not learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will be more than likely to have a good time!
