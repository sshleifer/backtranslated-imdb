This was the second of three films written by Irving Berlin for the Astaire-Rogers franchise and is by far the highest score and it is somewhat unusual for two of the numbers to be performed by Harriet Hilliard, leaving the rest to be split and / or shared among the leaders. As usual, the story does not have to be held back, even though the record was based on Shore Leave, which also served as the basis for Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who actually saw Shore Leave in the theater could be at the moment confused because the roles of Fred and Ginger were created for the film, but it always feels like music, lyrics and hooves, and that's all right. This is a diversion from other concessions in which 1) we see Astaire playing the piano - in real life he was a perfect pianist and composed several songs, one of which was built on a sad flight, Down, had a text by Johnny Mercer and he spent a couple of weeks in charts - and it's the only one in a series in which a serviceman played, even though a former hoofer who enrolled in the Navy after he was thrown off by the dance partner Ginger before the story arrived. He gets to the little known but excellent number in Berlin, I'd rather lead the band, just like duetting on I put all his eggs in one basket but the final number is prophetic - in 1936 rumbles the second world war we've already felt - to music and dance, one of the most powerful ballads ever played by the team. So if Randolph Scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without a horse or six-gun in range and Harriet Hilliard does not exactly set the screen in the fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger, and the only question is that they deliver. Answer: Peak.
