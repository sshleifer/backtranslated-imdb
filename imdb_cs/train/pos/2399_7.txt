It was a hit at Southwest Southwest Film Festival (SXSW) in Austin last year and features a subtle cast that led by Gloria Reuben from E.R. and a chew stage John Glover. Though shot at a small budget in NYC, the film looks and sounds amazing and takes us behind the scenes of swirling through the training and assembly what actors call "Scottish Play" as a reference to the word "Macbeth" is thought to have brought the ancient curse of the game. The acting company shows all the emotions of the game itself, desire, jealousy, anger, suspicion and a bit of fun. Games begin when an actor is replaced (in the lead role) with a well-known "pretty face" from the TV series scene to gain more crowds. From there, green eyes turn and the drama unfolds nicely. Excellent soundtrack and good performances all around. The DVD contains comments from the director and some omitted scenes.
