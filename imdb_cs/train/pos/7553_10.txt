When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely on the screen. His grandeur attracted me by focusing my attention all the time. I would recommend it not only to anime fans but to anyone who likes great movies (or who like really strange things). The artistic style is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism inside is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text in the film, but I think the way it does is to add a special style of film. The self-titled "Hello Kitty on acid" does not fit this epic proportional film. I'd like to find other works from who did it and see them.
