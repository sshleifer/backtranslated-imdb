I do not remember a lot of details about the show, but I remember how excited I was that I would have missed any episodes. Unfortunately, at that time we did not have a video recorder, so I did not see the series yet. However, I can remember how much I felt when watching and how excited I always came by. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor today (I think I was almost in love) and remains one of my favorite actors a day, mostly due to his appearance in the show. I would like to buy / steal / download this series, I think I would go to a large extent to see it again and return to a childhood that was long gone ... Any ideas? Does anyone know about a serialized site or has episodes on a tape since their first broadcast?
