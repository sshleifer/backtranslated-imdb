when I first saw the movie, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the scary things started, like when the church dies and is brought back to life again, and the morals and mother die and here the idiot's father is back to life, even though he prefers warning and ignores Jud.this is not Steven Kings's best job. I thought his best work was shining. I do not think people who see this movie and comment on how horrible it is are bad because they think what they think. as if this person could do a better job of shooting horror. I mean to do evil evil and how to kill Jud is a genius. making the most innocent most unsuspecting character to one of the murderers is fine. people who do not like the movie are silly because it's a haunted movie and nothing more. do not expect anything from a movie that is not. still in the general area was not so good. I still recommend people watch the movie
