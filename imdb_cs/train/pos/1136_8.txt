I'm not sure this commentary contains a real spoiler, but I play it safe, so do not read it if you did not see the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and so everyone I work with - and that's why. I spent a large part of my working life in the cinema without being an actor. These people are the _sung_ heroes of this film: gaffers, pullers, air directors, lighters and writers, costumes people etc, etc. And the whole thing is said from their point of view, at least to a large extent. Most actors are nuts and they are absorbed in the point of absurdity, which is what this film spoofs so well but you have to work with actors to realize that this movie is a real drama! A possible spoiler alert: In one great scene, two actors, both actors, discuss how to divide something personal, something "out of the scenario" with another actor, and start making lines, trying them out and criticizing each other's performance. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has appeared, what was, '91, it has become fashionable, especially on television. But hardly anyone has done so well.
