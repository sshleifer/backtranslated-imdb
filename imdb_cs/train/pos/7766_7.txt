After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON LOVE, Dorothy Malone finally gave up with her sweet sister and wife parents and demonstrated the ability to play mantras with the best of them. She and Gloria Grahame played the same kind of argument - and for her effort here in a very manipulative role, Malone won Best Actress Oscar Actress. <br /> <br /> The film in which it is, is not entirely in line with Oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama under the capable Douglas Sirko's hands. There is an almost noirish look at the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the confused fireworks in the story that has ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as his headliners. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of them took the opportunity with both hands and Stack was to be awarded for his sterling work as a weak, alcoholic brother desperate by despair in his own wild motive. Nominal stars are less impressive, but they do it with their usual skills and convictions - Hudson and Bacall. They play their sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding. The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case in Sirk), and it does not preclude me from thinking about a movie like Technicolor film noir in the vein of LEAVE HEAVEN. But it's worth watching with some interesting performances from the cast.
