I have seen the recent regional DVDs of this movie, which are displayed in the horror section of Oxford Street and also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular British comedy names and light entertainment for over four decades. Perhaps his continually cheerful, lush and essentially adventurous humor comes as a bit of cultural shock for many of the many wont of sour and cynical taste of many British comedies for the last 25 years. Nevertheless, there are still those who appreciate its lively and cheerful personality and complete avoidance of the pathos. Askey was the idol of Tommy Coopera, who often borrowed a "self-strangling" gag that Arthur is trying to entertain stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a striking, rare look of undervalued Linden Travers, which acts as a mysterious Julie.
