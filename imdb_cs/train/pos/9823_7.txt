I really thought it was not so bad. It's not a great piece of art, but Dermot M was by far the strongest artist. Patricia Arquette survived most of the time. In fact, he played a violoncello that was very impressive and his line was never forced. Besides, he is an incredibly beautiful person. Really sexy. Add talent to it, and most of what it was is far more acceptable. He always gives everything, even though some of the projects he's engaged with did not get the highest mark. In most cases it is not the actor's fault. Unfortunately, he was in some strange movies that simply did not answer in the box office. Always with the A-list of actors, but not always "hit". But he is "worth every penny" from any DVD leased or purchased. See Wedding Day with Debou Messing - one of his best total movies. ALL PENNY! ; ) (if you have not seen them, do it, then you will understand!)
