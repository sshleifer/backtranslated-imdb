This movie was introduced in a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not think of that wonderful TV series. I think it was a surprisingly good horror film at the beginning of the 1940s, with surprisingly good sound and a picture of the 67-year-old horror movie of the public home. I really liked to watch Belo Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife, who needs fluid from the gangs of young future brides, the old hug and her two bizarre sons, one huge idiot, the second comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto of 1932 Freaks). I also enjoyed a courageous young reporter who is a bit stereotypical but still enjoys it. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is a plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for the film. I do not want to spoil any of these movies, so go out and rent it, or even better, buy it for a few bucks.
