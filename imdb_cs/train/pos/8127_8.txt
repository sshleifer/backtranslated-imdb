While a bit of a lecture on progress as a saving ploy of humanity, it is still a stunning film that shows sci-fi special effects of blockbusters that would take another 40 years before arriving on the silver screen. It predicts world-wide chaos of World War II but extends the premise that the conflict lasts for 30 years, and then tells an epic tale of fighting humans out of the wreckage and the wilderness of the universe. The effects seem to be woody and strangely sterile, but it is perhaps the result of their contrast with the visuals that were absolutely breathtaking at the time of the release of the film, and which still works today. It's a movie that nobody should be interested in the SF genre in life.
