I have a copy of both of these classic movies where Robert Blake is a mighty gentle actor where most of the 1967 film Blake is more shown to stand by the windows in prison saying his childhood life where he does because why he killed a clutter family to show a lot in classic of what really went on and does not say which one really did kill, but it's a great eye catcher really, if you're watching the 1996 movie In the cold blood classic makes a lot more sence.
