This film is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He is curious about David Aamese's viewers. His character can relate to us in every way. The story line is very clever and keeps the audience at the edge of the movie. I have never really watched Cruise movies so much before, but after seeing it, it shows real talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end when everything comes to a big conclusion and he finds the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely try it. It's one of the movies that when you start watching, you have to see it all the way, or you'll think about it and you'll regret it. My point is that you should go buy and risk what I did and become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's A * 10/10 I promise you that once you look at it, she'll hold on to you and you'll like it forever.
