We start by saying that the English title of this film, "Power of the Kangwon Province", is the absolute wrong name. This is because Hong Sang Soo has no real footage of wars, troubles, and conflicts. province is neither appropriate nor valid in the context of this film. "Kangwon-do ui ho" will appear as a mysterious statement about the emotional turbulence of young protagonists whose minds are not calm. Hong Sang Soo also directed a very fruitful visual documentary about the unstable election of people in their lives . The affected people are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their mood, fuss and fancies. If the film is made from nothing, it can be claimed to be the meritorious virtue of a filmmaker, Hong Sang Soo must be deserving as a courageous filmmaker, whose films talk about volumes of ubiquitous human relationships, sentiments, and lives. Whether it likes it or not, it's the only correct conclusion that can be deduced from this particular movie.
