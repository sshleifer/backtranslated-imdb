PIRERT'S KINEMA GUIDE (2007) **** If a loving cinema makes me a deviation, be it! <br /> <br /> If you are a real 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you can not get enough movies about movies and I do not necessarily think of a dry documentary and then. I think a complete discourse about the experiences of the film. Well, if that were the case, I got a movie experiment for you. In Sophie Fiennes (sister Ralph & Joseph, if you were curious), the philosopher how cinophile Slavoj Zizek, who gave his analysis a cinema with an impressive (and often outrageous) cinema, acquires everything from the quiet Chaplin era to the modern age of the Wachow Brothers, analyzing, pontificate the psychosexual foundations, the socio-economic, political and, of course, undefined spell of film experience with their clumsy, determined and almost frenzied dissertations. To go from the explanation of how the Bates House in PSYCHO is actually the mirror psyche of the conflicting Norman Bates with every level like his Ego, Superego & Id is one thing, but then suggesting the same thing about each of Marx's brothers in barely a rhythm of a remarkable test of faith wins over the skeptical layman. Even though I did not know who was Zizek? resembles the hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalm, European actress Rad Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energies of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese? with his tingling tongue and passion, the guest meets like a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes nicely puts Zizka in several movie clips whose background was painted in a humorous tone, but still keeps stupidity and stupidity to continue with a full gas flap, giving a pause to the argument in three acts covering a range of films like Kubrick , Lynch, Hitchcock and various films such as THE WIZARD OF OZ, RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> Is there anything for everyone, and if one man can bring up an argument or at least a reason to discuss the themes of the movie? even though Freudian / Jungian are in error? then I say that this film theory is worth watching. Search for it now if you can before it comes to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.
