Okay, I first got this movie as a Christmas present so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie should be in stereoscopic 3D. It's for the most part, but whenever the main character is in her car, the movie drops to 2D! What!!?!?! It's not that hard to shoot in a car! Second - The story is not very good. It's a lot of things wrong. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why they show all the deaths at the beginning of the movie! That caused the movie to suck whenever someone was killed! Look good laugh, but do not waste your time by buying them. Just download or something cheap.
