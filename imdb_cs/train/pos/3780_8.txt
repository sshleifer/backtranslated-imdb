Only after a second look did I realize for a few years that I realized two things about this film: 1) I liked it very much and 2) because its execution is definitely sharper than the assumption itself. I laughed at the film before I realized I was going to resume my first protests - the valleys and valleys and the airhead (even * good * air puzzles) were simply not funny, especially when they were set aside. But although the momentum momentum of the film is beginning to fade to the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. on an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comic timing to the extent that even the most awkward scripts of jokes (such as Ted's inability to recognize a certain resident hell) work just as easily as a marauder (eg a challenge). And the teamwork between Winter and Reeves is so good that the teaming of Bill and Ted (who have spent only one scene apart in the movie, disaster, if not well adapted) seems to be absolutely unenviable. <br /> <br /> (Side note: I found the first movie sporadically funny - it seems to me that I liked it.) I give it 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
