Just like the other people who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doctor," I happened to find this little jewel on the night TV without hearing it before. A peculiar blend of cellulite stories about a sexy, but ruthless anti-hero on the one hand, and a realistic and well-explored depiction of war in the trenches on the other hand, should have hooked me from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is one of the five best WWI movies for me (the others are "Everything Silent on the Western Front", "The Glory Paths", "Gallipoli" and the post-war "La vie et rien d'autre") . And the scene with a poisonous gas attack is really cool; horses and men look like apocalypse riders with their gas masks. I just wish I had a movie.
