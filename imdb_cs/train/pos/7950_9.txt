I first loved Bruce Broughton's musical score, very lyrical, and that in itself added to the spell of the film. The best aspect of the film was three animals superlatively expressed by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and late Don Ameche. While Fox has the most entertaining lines, Ameche plays a rather distracting, otherwise engaging figure (voice of reason) and Field adds a joke to the character that is always seen when he says Chance off. The people were not so entertaining and sometimes the film pulled, but that's the only complaint. It's a beautiful-looking movie with beautiful close ups of Canadian pictures. Although the film itself is relatively long, it is never a really boring moment and this is beneficial from voice work and well-written scenarios. Overall, this is a charming and perhaps underrated film, with me 9/10. Bethany Cox.
