Whenever I hear a movie that is announced because it does not have sex, violence, bad language, special effects and so on, my bs.s. the detector goes out. Usually, the film is such as sentimental chewing, which irritates people who want nothing to surprise them, but to confirm how superior people are treated for us. So when David Lynch THE STRAIGHT STORY started getting to such kind of reviews, I was terrible, especially because I was not a fan of his next uplifting story THE ELEPHANT MAN. For all the stunning images and good work in this film, it seemed that we were more interested in preaching than inspiring us. I did not have to worry. The direct story is a more sincere film than saccharin. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney say it straight and simply for the most part. There are a couple of homilies from Straight that I could do without, and the crops of crops that are harvested are repeated a little too much, but they are only minor things. There is no hard news, no sentimental strings that would leave us emotions and no celebrations to us and its characters. Instead, they rely on the fact that the story builds its own strength, so we do it so we actually moved in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, Casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the work. In fact, it's someone who seems to have lived a lot but still does, and besides homilies, the desire he has to return with his brother does not seem too sentimental, because you may feel that there is someone who lived too long and he saw too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And he knows his time is exhausted, and he wants to make some peace not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also makes fine, unmanageable work as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and suburban boy, Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes are beautifully shot, so they want to visit me at least for some day.
