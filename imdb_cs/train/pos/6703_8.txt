My children have recently begun to watch the repeat of this show - both early episodes on the N and later on the ABC Family - and they love it. (I was not aware that the show even lasted for the first or second season). I wonder what triggered all the changes - I saw them labeled "highly promoted," and yet half an hour of search on the site revealed only endless comments about how earlier episodes were much better than later episodes. (I personally do not see much difference - scenarios and themes remain largely the same - but some great people are losing their way) My daughter puts a DVD on her wish list, so maybe the soil of special features and comments illuminates it. I also wanted to change - like Boy Meets World, where they took off a little sister for the whole season or so, and when another actor appears, they ask her where she was and she says "up "or when the mark" Minkus "appears at the beginning of the grammar school, he asks him where he is and says" there, "and pointed to the camera before he says," Hey, Mr. Turner, wait! " and running out of the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left) Oh, well - maybe in this or what? I was happy to see Aunt Hilda appear at the final - he was always one of my favorites - it's bad that it could not be a more comprehensive gathering. (Zelda candle does not cut it for me)
