R rated for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13 + Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The fear of black hats is one of the most entertaining, the most original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a gangsta rap version of This Is Spinal Tap. It's a shame that many people have heard of this gem of the film. If you can find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy even if you do not like rap music. many comedic movies that I give it the perfect 10/10. The only thing I think of is the movies, the Directors, the Garp World, the 40-year-old virgin, and Chasing Amy. This movie is a gay stereotype gangsta rap film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who makes a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z hats). It's basically a stereotype of rap groups that makes many controversial rap songs about killing and being gangsta.Fear of a Black Hat is an excellent comedy film and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It's a shame that this movie is not in Top 250. <br /> <br /> Running: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
