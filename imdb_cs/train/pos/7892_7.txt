FREDDY moved from scary to fun, in this sixth installment in the Nightmare series. It was 2 years, in fact, 11, because this movie takes place in 2001. And FREDDY killed every last child on Elm Street except one, John Doe (Jacobb of Part 5, even the movie gives somewhat of who it is), in which he used to bring more kids to come to Elm street.Not only FREDDY gets his wish but he also gets his daughter back on Elm street.When he finds out what's going on, she and other kids decide to kill FREDDY once for all . We'll also look at some of FREDDY's mysterious backgrounds. Rachel Talalay, who had long been attacked by a nightmare. Many people hate this movie, but I enjoyed it. I tried to show what FREDDY is doing with his wisekrackes ... COMDEY and makes the series more fun than terrifying. So this movie is really a painful comedy to talk. It's not a frost in the series, Part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
