Last night I went to bed with my boyfriend, and while my teeth were dying, I turned the channels until I came across this Chinese film called The King of the Mask. At first I thought it would be the Kung Fu movie so I started watching it and then captured me immediately and had to finish it. The little girl in the movie is completely adorable. She was such a great actor that she is so little. Maybe it was in Chinese, so it was English dubbed, it was harder for me to say ... but it seemed to be perfectly perfect. I feel so bad about the girl when she tried to please her boss, but everything turned out to be spoiled. lol. Even if he brings him another grandson, just to transfer his art ... It turned out that the kid was kidnapped, so he was arrested and had 5 days to live. lol ... anything she touches to be nice to her grandfather, just back. <br /> <br /> She finally sees how much love she has in her and teaches her the mask of the mask ... which is all so heartfelt about the misfortune in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely jewel and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
