For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with no idea what's going on, so I think many other reviews of this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie again and I have to re-emphasize the BEST end of any movie. At all. At all. At all. The actual translation, "Flying butterfly wings," is not a translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans did not know what the chaos theory was (except for those who saw or read Jurassic Park). The film is based on the theory of chaos and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that all lead to one event. The film is a whirlwind of the strange cause and effect when we follow the chain of chaos that interconnects between several characters (about 20?). In this way, the end seems inevitable despite that, but if you think about it, it is a perfect end. Think yourself, "what else do you need to say"? It is also a very daring end. It's a shame we have to go overseas as a jewel like this one, but that end would never come from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
