After reading the reviews of this movie, I obviously began to watch with great doubt in my mind that it would actually be good. But this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Most reviews I've read say that a complicated conspiracy has made it too hard to track it. And while some parts leave you confused, the end connects so many free ends that you feel as if you kicked out because you've missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch," in the sense that it's not that much fun (in fact it's pretty dark) and it's much smarter scenes from different points of view (and in one of the best scenes of the movie Jason Statham spent five minutes in the elevator with an argument with himself). The way he resembles two of the films I just mentioned is that he is full of unforgettable characters, namely Statham, who gives fantastic performance as the lead, and Ray Liotto, who spent most of the movie at Speedos, but still performs great. If you have the time and time to think about the movie and you will even be able to watch it, you will actually see all the symbols and hints that are in the film. I think it's fantastic and that Guy Ritchie is the director at the top of his game.
