Oh, you hungry Italians. This is not the first time they founded the film on source material without the permission or knowledge of the author of the novel, in this case. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian, but it was a lot in the early days of cinema, mainly because they often thought they could get along with it. Publishers of James M. Cain have managed to keep this film out of US screens until 1976, but the film itself has grown a bit into a well-known classic. The movie is not so great, but it's a great movie. This, of course, not least due to the film, is a great story that is interesting and provides a movie with some great characters and realism. This is called the novel very closely, and is therefore mostly the same as other film versions of his story, of course, as a difference that he has come into the Italian environment. Let the Italians make a film about life and real people in it. These early drama have always a very realistic feeling and are therefore quite involved in the observation. Unfortunately, the film lost some of its power to the end, when the film began to feel somewhat exaggerated and stretched in parts. The movie could easily end 15 minutes earlier. However, I do not really have a lot of negative information about this movie. It is simply a highly created, based on some equally large and powerful resource. A pretty impressive directorial debut for director Luchin Visconti, who has continued to direct many other great and unforgettable Italian dramas. <br /> <br /> 8/10
