Also known as "Water Lilies," this film tells the story of two girls fighting their way into the world of love and sex. This story is solved slowly and it works very well. It provides plenty of time and space to get to know different characters and get closer to them. <br /> <br /> Using a small cast gives some special pressure to the people who play because they all have more screen time than normal, but the people who play in this movie can do it well. Everyone is completely believable. The visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the pool bring a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many movies have been made on the same subject, although this does not actually appear over any of them. He pulls out of the high hat some "standard" pressure methods and works on them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's certainly not great, and I think it could do better if it only took on less exploring angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
