He meets in a medieval quarter in the imaginary city of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with light touch toys with such American obsessions as mask and violence, materialism and possession of Jones, fear of others, slavery, golf, and destruction of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me, it's almost as light as a pen. <br /> <br /> Zombies are featured among the characters. Key questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of Willard's people choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many zombies do their bids as robots (become a mark of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be resolved between living and such reincarnated dead? Sometimes, director Andrew Currie, who also collaborated with the live script (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this unlikely material percolated for one and a half hours without disappointing for lack of good laughter. Super Black plays: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the directors helping young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, an innocent child with a good heart, acting as a fair testimony for any ridicule of adults. (I saw her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Mrs. Moss had such great comedies.) Production design and music are wonderful in the 50s, on tee. Maybe this is not for everyone. It will be a heavy movie that will be measured at Bizarro's annual price. But intelligent comedies that remain humorous from start to finish are among the toughest achievements in movies. For me it's "Fido"! My Stats: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (Seen on 01/30/07)
