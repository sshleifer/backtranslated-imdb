As I noticed with a large number of IMDb comments, some reviewers seem to demand that every movie they've seen should have smugly intelligent drawings that touch on skill. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see blasts, shooting and heroism. If I look at comedy, I want to have a laugh in my eyes. You get the idea. That's why I'm looking at a horror film, especially I want to be scared. The Grudge is a very frightening film, both of which are well-done "jump" scenes, and it's scary. I've been a fan of horror films for many years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, rather than the directors of some running jerseys that are burned today. If you want to worry, check out this movie. The road is more frightening than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also consider to be a great movie).
