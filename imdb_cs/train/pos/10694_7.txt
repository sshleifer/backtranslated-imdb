I have a lot of experience with women in Russia and this movie shows what a lot of them, unfortunately. They are very cunning, merciless and greedy, as well as very unfair. From robotic sex, blowing with gifts, lies, and betrayal, I have seen it all in Russia. I know what I am talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the photos of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It contains thousands of pictures of many Russian girl girls I've met, black comedies, scams that I've met with the story of my burn and the appearance of Russian national television. Http: //www.happierabroad.com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You will be glad. I spent a lot of time putting it together. So look at it. The Russian woman played by Nicole Kidman is much like Julia and Katya in her photos. My 3 brides who are looking for excursions to Russia are very exciting and sell, so why not make a movie from my bride looking for an adventure in Russia? But there is one real impossibility in this movie, and that's the way the guy orders his bride from the catalog and takes her to the airport. It does not work at all, so I do not understand why the media want to keep it. There is not one introduction web site for Russian brides that would work this way, and I urge everyone to find something that's going on. The fact is you can only order contact information (e-mail, address, phone number, etc.) Russian ladies from the website. From there, answer and then visit it, and if you want to bring it to your country, start immigration in your INS office and wait months later. That's how it works in real life. You can not just tell her to get to the airport. US immigration will NEVER allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted when I went abroad!
