Fabulous early music by Ren√© Clair as entertaining and humorous as his silent "Italian straw hat". Using the sound in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced the early musicals in America (opera scene from Night in Opera is heavily influenced, for example, by Le Million). They were (but not) seen by all the movies and the DVD from the criteria is just as good as you would expect. There is not a lot of add-ons, but most of the DVDs I've seen are unnecessary fluff and Clair's conversation on the disk is the one I have never seen before. Get it when it's still around.
