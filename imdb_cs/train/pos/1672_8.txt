The case of Scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo that directs Sergio Martino, who appears to be the second most important giallo, but Dario Argento. Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit, a rather complicated but ultimately very satisfying and fun mystery of murder. It also puts an end to it, a great benefit, as it is not always the reason for giallo because it tends to expand credibility with infinite red ingredients and final solutions. Here's the more you know about the plot, the better. Pure giallo trademarks are beautiful cinematography, catchy music scores, beautiful women (Anita Strindberg's goddess), brutal murders, black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most parts it is fairly acting, Goerge Hilton's usually suave me and others do pretty well. Martino drives with a hand, keeps things tense and atmospheric with some amazing sets. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of giallo, you have to see it. If you like well-written and thrilling thrillers in general, it's highly recommended.
