Wow, I praise IMDb and Google because I've been trying to recall the title of this great movie for over 15 years. High defeat, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a bunch of actors and actors and yadda yadda yadda because you all know what's going on. That's why you're here anyway. What I will do is explain what memory I have from this quintessential 80-band D-Movie slasher. In 1987, when I was about seven years old, my father rented all these horror films. Will he care for his children to look at him? No. So at that young age I saw Slaughter High. What I've seen in this movie has torn me off. I have not seen it since then, but I remember most of the laugh in the movie today. For example, a sex scene (why is there a metal bed in the school?) It becomes an electric current. Or the man drowned in the pool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... a bursting stomach of beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie in which one of the characters discovers a beer in an abandoned school, for example 10 or 15 years later, and thinks it would be good to drink it? Then his acorn explodes? What!? And the great line: Let's take a car ... it always starts. Classic bulls all the way. <br /> <br /> I think I'm looking back, almost 20 years later, and laughs. But when I was seven, I was scared. That jester hat (or it was a mask?) That the killer rock scared all over me f * ck out! Everybody in all, yes, a miserable movie. But because of the nostalgic purpose and the humor factor, this movie gets me out of 9 out of 10. Either stay really late every night and I hope you will see it at the same late late film show or you will win a copy of the VHS and dust from your video recorder.
