I have not seen the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems to me very interesting and inspirational. It was one of the most interesting trailer I've ever seen. The questions he presented really stopped me and thought that a unique approach to boxing is a metaphor of the "battle inside" ... thanks to the god that someone is hitting another angle with boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I especially enjoyed a short clip with a Rocky movie actor, really clever. I thought that the chosen topic - overcoming adverse events and traumas from childhood - is timeless and God knows that many people need it. Bring it.
