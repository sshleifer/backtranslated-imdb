This is a powerful film from a historical and epic point of view. While the story is simple, it is pure and straightforward. In fact, this is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and richer people of that period. Poor vs. rich, honest vs. a dishonest, classic but well-narrated story without a large amount of Hollywood glitz on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you can almost feel people on the screen. :)
