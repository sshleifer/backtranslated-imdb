Tintin and I recently broadcast as an episode of P.O.V. series. It is based on a filmed interview with Georges Remi, a.k.a. Herzt Tintin's 1971 filmmaker, in which he explores his various experiences of publishing his favorite character, first in a Catholic newspaper and then in his own comic book series. Amazing thoughtful looks on various comic sites and surrealistic ideas of Herge's dreams. I first met Tintin on the Children's Book website at my local library of primary schools where I read the secret of a unicorn. My mother later got a CD subscription and every month I read the entire Red Rackham's Treasure treasure. I remember seeing some Tintin comics in the local book store, but for some reason I did not get the truth because I was 12 and I thought I was driving them out. I have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after the death of Herge. You have not read them yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life, as if he left his first wife after his affair with a paint job at work (with whom he later married). Her name is Fanny, and she is here to talk. If you like Tintin and his creator, this movie is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07 - I have now read Breaking Free. Tintin and the Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and are adapted to Mr Daniels's anti-capitalist views with Tintin, who is portrayed as a smart-chip on the shoulder who still cares about the captain with whom he remains. The captain is just trying to end up with the wife and daughter he loves dearly. They and other construction workers promise to attack after a colleague's employee dies of a fatal accident. The whole thing is happening in England with the subtle accents of the working class. It was not such a thing that Herge would agree, but nothing interesting. Oh, yes, the Snowy dog ​​appears only in the top left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running across the police!) And dedication pages.
