by thinking that it is not a well filmed movie, but it's a very good version of a real event and the best rendering so far. And if you're WW2 crazy, then it's a treat for you because there are three of the four saboteurs who play a part in this movie. It is a theater that acts at best, but then it is as it was before the semifinals. <br /> <br /> I personally am a tough fan of our almost human heroes of World War II and there should be hundreds of these films showing us what they are doing so they will not forget the next generation.As the children do not read today books, watching movies. So if you want action extravaganza, Ryan, it's true about persistent pain, disgusting endurance and the will to fight when everything seems to be lost.
