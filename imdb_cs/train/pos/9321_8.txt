As a romantic comedy to go, it was cute and winning. I thought writing could have been stronger so the final link was a bit better, but it's not a huge trip. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give a beautiful performance and are just as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors and I was glad to see them as romantic. I hope they will soon appear in more projects. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and winning. It is not bad to be at all.
