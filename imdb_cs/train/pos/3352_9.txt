in the western part, it should exist under a genre called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, generally underestimated Western states import their film noir persona to enhance some convincingly dark characteristic sketches and bring the elegance of the fatigue light that is more familiar to Sam Peckinpah films. "Man with a gun" is one of his best. Director Orson Welles protects Richard Wilson, a sharp, monochrome beauty full of cool silhouettes and scary explosions of wild violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopoly with a private army. Mitchum's regression, from a finely spoken foreigner to a murderous murderer, with a lot of dark emotions between himself, is an astonishing expression and physical activity.
