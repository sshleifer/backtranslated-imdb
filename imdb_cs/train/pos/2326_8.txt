Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fall in love with a neighboring court (Jason London). But after a terrible tragedy, it was not concluded that both sisters realized that nothing could keep them in conflict and that their love would never disappear. This was a really heartbreaking story of first love. Probably the most painful tale of young love I've ever seen. All the acting is amazing and Reese Witherspoon gives great performance in her first film. I'd give Man on the Moon 8.5 / 10
