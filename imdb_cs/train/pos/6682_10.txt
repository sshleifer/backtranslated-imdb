I saw it in the theaters, and I absolutely loved him. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain I've ever seen from Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were in the church in the sky. The film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character was not really British. The scene with him and his mother's talk of being a superhero almost brought me tears. I loved the fact that The Bowler spoke with the ball. Some of the funniest things involved Stiller and his fury, Fury, and his fact that his threats and lining were all crazy and they never made any sense. I could hardly stop clapping when he said, "Fraculater, Freinken-puss," was said. But one of the most popular things was that Captain Amazing really dies in the movie. I HIGH I recommend this movie for every occasion and I give it my own personal double thumbs.
