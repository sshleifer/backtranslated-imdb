Stunning high quality movie. Apparently based on real events, which, as has been said, have a clear circle of truth about this, this film is very emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often becomes ridiculous in adulthood as one of life failures, whether it is a gangster, a drug addict, or the burden of society. Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the navy is worried. He is on the brink of losing. He is counseled in psychiatric therapy and that is the relationship that is in the middle of the game in the game. <br /> <br /> In the flash barrier and therapy, the source and anti-anxiety drugs are revealed. <br /> <b> Excellent performance from the entire cast. The story is essentially a family tragedy with emotional and physical suffering. All actors give a full bloody performance with conviction and realism. One message from the film is the importance of raising children well. Real Antwone deserves success. To be godless as a child, but elevated above him, shows a magnificent nature. And to all those who suffered but survived and succeeded: you are all the winners. 10 out of 10.
