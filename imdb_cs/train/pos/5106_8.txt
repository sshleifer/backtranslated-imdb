I think every time I see one of those old 80s films, it puts me back in a simpler time, no matter how it seems today. This movie is good. I remember seeing it as a small child, and I thought it was the biggest movie ever. She has all the heroic characters the young cowboy wants to be. Now as an adult, I can look back, laugh and still feel sad, but this time I actually knew what was going on. I found one thing strange. How many people can move to Houston, join Sissy, get married, relocate to a trailer, get out, cheat, have an uncle to die and then come back together all over a month? Just in America.
