Gentleman Jim is another example of a legend, and Errol Flynn plays the legendary boxer as a dirty but charismatic social mountaineer in distraught entertainment that hardly stops to breath. It's such an unnecessary search for historical precision, as is the case in Flynn, The Charge of the Light Brigade - a pure hokum with all the stops drawn, shot in the surprisingly rich scale and lively sense of Raoul Walsh. Flynn is still at the top of his power (you never thought he'd made a mild heart attack during production), Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner, and a steady helper Alan Hale together for a good currency, this time as Flynn's father Jack Carson has tasks on the side) . Even the pirate galeon from older movies Flynn does somewhat out-of-place dude in the bay at the dock! 103 minutes just for the breeze.
