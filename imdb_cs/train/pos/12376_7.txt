All Star Performance so impressive that it almost looks like Mad Mad Mad Mad World Horror, "The Sentinel" (1977), however, is an effectively scary film directed at a relatively unknown actress, Cristina Raines. In this game, the fashion model Alison Parker is playing, moving to Brooklyn Heights brownstone, which is (and I do not think I'm doing very late in this late date) very close to the gate of hell. And as a tenant in this building suffers much worse conditions than escape pipes and occasional water bugs, and that's a bit of a thing! The scene in which Alison meets her noisy upper neighbor is really terrifying, and she should definitely send ice water that moves along the back of most of the audience. In spite of many criticisms of Raines' acting critics, I thought she was fine, though she certainly did not give up on scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The image is a really exciting conclusion, and although some fence points are inexplicable, I felt more than satisfied. As the book "DVD delirium" writes, "No Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvie Miles's movie as a cannibal lesbian canine in T-shirts can not be all bad!" On the side note, I switched to Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights yesterday to look at the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although he stretched out of the heavy ivy coat and missing the blind priest / nun in the top floor window, it looks the same as in this picture. If this house really sits at the top of the entrance to hell, I think hell is ... Brooklyn's Royal Motorway. We, the New Yorkers, have known it for a long time!
