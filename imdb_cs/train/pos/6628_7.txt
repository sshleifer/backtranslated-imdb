I saw this film in an avant-premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco. I saw the first trailer four years ago and from that moment I waited until I saw the final result. I was not disappointed. This is a complete 3D movie with a high contrast black and white print. He is obviously inspired by some comic books, such as F. Miller's films. This optics goes a step further than the excellent adaptation of "Sin City" by R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) no gray or no medium color, but a graphic style that has never been seen in a realistic animated film. (Hard to wait for a scanner) <br /> <br /> Massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the character and we will soon forget that the technical aspect focuses on classic elements such as direction or plot. The direction remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the media, and that is really a good surprise. The Futuristic Story (Paris 2053) makes him a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested until the end. In spite of the classical basis (an investigation that exceeds initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting repetitive themes (genetics, the absolute power of some companies ...) give this film a great interest. <br /> <br /> This is an animated movie that is probably not intended for children. You will not find any funny pet or silly family morale, just a cold reality. It's much closer to a good movie noir. I have found that this setting is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel well-known Paris, but it is transformed with a gentle touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I regret a few mistakes. Installation is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliche slowed effects and some bad dialogs. Although technically excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like "final fantasies"). These small things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch as far as possible. Director Christian Volckman knows how to get into a potential trap (lucky John Woo did not want to do it!). Finally, it's a movie with a blast of visual, intelligent story and a wonderful artistic direction. Watch out if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for spelling mistakes.
