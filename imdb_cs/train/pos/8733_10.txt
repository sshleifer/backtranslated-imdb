When I bought my Toy Story cassette when it came out on the video after I was released in theaters, I saw a trailer for what the Toy Story creators said. Once I saw that I knew it would be a good asset! I was right! Bug's Life as Toy Story is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite figures are Dim the Rhinoceros Beetle Expressed by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar Expressed by late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when the Slim Walking Stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich and tries to turn away Bird and Hemlich, like you are Mr. Early Bird. And what a great tasting of a worm on a stick and Slim, as if I got caught! I'm going to! I just died on the scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, though I know a lot of people think this is the worst movie Pixar ever! I do not know how you can not hate Pixar! I think they are pretty good movies! Good work PIXAR!
