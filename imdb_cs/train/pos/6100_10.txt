It's really fun (and sexy) movie - it's not just stupid, but it's great acting. It's a kind of movie where the characters are so funny that you feel like you're connected with everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival and I found out that I laughed at all of the others and moved some of the more serious parts of the film. It's a unique film about two doctors and I do not want to give anything, but there are some strong scenes, just as really fun - and the dialogue is great. Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldan and Brian White and Mya are also entertaining and sexy in their roles. If you can see this - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth it again. Wood Harris deserves a price.
