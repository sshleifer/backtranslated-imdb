I saw this movie 10 years ago. and watched on the video on average once a year since then. this is the kind of film that is timeless because the themes are universal, yet the stories and the interviews are so personal. it's also one of the few films that capture you from the first frame to the role, even though there are really only two characters. this owes a lot of hockey players and delpas who believe that they are really jesse and celine. this is also the first movie I've ever seen that has mentioned reality TV, and now the phenomenon is uncontrollable! I love the way this movie simply surrounds the audience in its space and makes you think about being one of you that you are one of those characters. I also wanted to go by train in Europe! I did not meet someone who was not capable of this film. Maybe they are talking about themselves, my friends, or just the pure genius of this movie.
