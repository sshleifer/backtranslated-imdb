This is definitely a good update for the original, except that "the left side is now on the right." Like the original, this film opposes a federal government that crosses its borders with respect to personal freedom. It is a warning how little political freedoms are at the time of excessive and excessive power of federal government. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, in co-operation with the mainstream media, threw words like "white supremacist" and "right-wing extremists, as well as devotional drug charges to alleviate the most basic of its civil rights with the willing consent of the general population. so no-PC, I am amazed that this movie could be created - at least not without the federal government through IRS down to the producers like them "Live Free or Die" is the motto of Jason Priestly's hat when he superbly portrays "the voice" , and it summarizes the dangerous (for some) message of this movie. <br /> <br />
