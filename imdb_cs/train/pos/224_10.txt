Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I first saw it when it was like the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when she first appeared and loved it since then. Eventually, I saw it six times in theaters, and if he played it today, I would see it again. Now a lot of reviews have diminished the amazing performance of leaders. Matthau was brilliant but was unlucky to be nominated against Jack Nicholson Oscar winning performance by Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Burns won, though Richard Benjiman deserved at least to be nominated. The role was played perfect, like Fritz Feld bankruptcy on potato commercial tokens. Which brings me to my reason why he made this film, the direction of the highly underestimated Herbert Ross, who had previously brought two "Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and released a full movie, again. Opens theater plays without looking like a photographic scene, telling the story and characters. <br /> <br /> We are 20 minutes in the movie before we get to the scene that opens the game where Ben Clark comes to visit his uncle and tell him about a special comedy. play in the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is completely new. A few years ago, I saw a revival of the game with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall on the highway, which was great. But I think Ross and the screenwriter Simon Simon have improved. It's just a wonderful movie.
