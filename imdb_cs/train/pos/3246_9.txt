I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie looked like clicks, story, characters, settings. As for the movie, I will not say this great movie, but it is fantastic for what it is supposed to be. It makes sense. Casting is maybe as good as if you got together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are gay. For those who have not seen it, I will give you a brief overview: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a bank robbery from their friend. However, when their friend is arrested by two police officers pursuing him from New Jersey, he tries to find out what is going on, and everything hell is loosening. The movie is really a great bands' comedy book and is like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, with just four criminals who can not stand each other in Montana rather than Las Vegas. Overall, if you want to laugh, I'd love to see you in this movie.
