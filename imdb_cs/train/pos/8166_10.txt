This movie is great! The game is fine, with the excellent cast of Corbin Bernsen as the perfect dentist who scared and tortured his patients. At first he sees his wife with a poolman and then goes crazy. He will also take revenge on his wife and poolman, in addition to the patients who torture. Most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a bored tongue that puts out for 1 night outdoors and is still red in the morning). But the agonizing scenes are perfectly well done. Although this film has a weak point, it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for a real horror / thriller fan, it's a must!
