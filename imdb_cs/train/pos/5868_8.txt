I loved this movie. It is seldom to see Vietnam after birth, and this battle scenes with movie and exciting bombs and shooting. I had no idea I'd been hit. What an amazing view of how alien veterans feel. It was hard to look, honestly. We all understand the struggle and type of Apocalypse Now, but it is so different. What happens when she returns and tries to live her life? I can not. I realized a large group of men lost in America. He can not relate, can not sleep, can not have love affairs, can not cope with "normal society". She feels completely apart. This is a huge tragedy that is not sufficiently addressed. Yeah, we've changed our attitude towards the Vietnam veterans, now we like it, but what? It did not seem to be important to them. It's too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no further criticism.
