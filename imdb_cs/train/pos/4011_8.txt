After Superfriends and Scooby Doo left Saturday morning waves in the autumn of 1986, I quite stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons because they were the only two to keep me tuned. And because neither Real Ghostbusters nor Flintstone Kids seemed very promising to have "left" and started sleeping on Saturday morning. On Saturday morning I did not come back in 1988, just for one and only one animated show. <br /> <br /> The new animated Superman show was something I did not want to go through. I was 17 years old and in high school, but what the hell! I loved this show. From what I can remember, this series was a fan donor, which I suppose to celebrate the 50th birthday of Superman of that particular year. She had thematic music and a musical style reminiscent of John Williams' film score from Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman. I honestly felt Ruby Spears's animated style resembled the Super Powers Team: The Galactic Guardians series from Hanna Barbera a few years ago. Unfortunately, Danny Dark was not back as Superman, but I felt that Beau Weaver had done a very impressive work because the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was not like the version of Chris Reeve. After hearing him as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic at 90th Fantastic Four, I've still seen this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was the voice manager of Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears, and I think she took it on herself to make Lois. Memories of SuperFriends fans have lost in this series when the voice over the cast has come to an end. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was formerly Firestorm on SuperFriends. Perry White is none other than the former television writer Batman Stanley Ralph Ross, who was Superfly on Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Power show. And Lex Luthor, now wise cracked billionaire tycoon, is none other than SuperFriends voice alumina, Michael Bell, whom I know best as Zan and Riddler, as well as many other characters in many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt that this series was a combination of Superman movie along with post-crisis John Byrne's vision of Superman, with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman. The Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark series also do this. Unfortunately we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Except for Luthor, we saw only Prankster and we saw General Zoda. I especially enjoyed one episode with Wonder Woman by BJ Ward, who also starred in Super Powers. <br /> <br /> Episodes broke and I also enjoyed Clark's growth and development stories from childhood to childhood to adulthood, who moved to Metropolis in a short segment of the Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things I did not like. It took only one season. And after the Wonder Woman, I was hoping that Batman would appear to Adam Westem (I still think of the Super Powers Team episodes). I was looking at it, because in the Prankster episode, the Metropolis baseball team was built against the Gotham Goliam. <br /> <br /> Every popular Super Hero has one series of drawings that is very rare. For SpiderMan, I think it's a solo series from 1981 that was broadcast at the same time as Amazing Friends. For Incredible Hulk it's a cartoon of 1982. For a fantastic four, it's a series of 1978 with HERBIE WORKER. For Batman, it's a new adventure of Batman 1977 from the BatMite movie. But for Superman it's the rarest series. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documents never contain or mention them. This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release. Everybody in all, this version of Superman of 1988 is well .... Super !!
