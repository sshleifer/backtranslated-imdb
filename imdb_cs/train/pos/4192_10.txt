In what is likely to be on my list of Fuller's best films (that is, once I see more of them that this and the Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a movie noir where femme fatale as well as a male protagonist are not stereotypical in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller meets his own experience and sense of New York style, which is mostly lacking in Hollywood legs. On a small budget - at least for those like Darryl F. Zanuck - Fuller and his actors create personalities that are pleasant even in such a dark atmosphere. Good guys are basically those who will not be violent with you, even if they are looking for more money. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are all great in the main parts. Widmark is just a few actors I think is about who could really break this character. It's a bit like a Bugs Bunny, because it can be a wise ass that is a bit tricky. On the other hand, the figure of Skip McCoy has a number of values ​​in his life. He does not belong to other people's affairs and does not work for a large part of the working world outside his little cottage on the river after being sent away for three years. He will not let him pick up a woman (Peters) on the train and pick up the subject under the eyes of the government. He can have some secrets that could bring him a lot of money. But what is the value of the movie because it is Moe's stool (Ritter is one of the most beautiful and most believable actors of the season), the former female (Kiley) and the police department. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the thematic elements that are narrated in a dramatic, journalistic style (just like Fuller's previous position along with boxer), the dialogue is fresh and impressive. There is spontaneity in many Fuller's camera movements. And what a third step. It's a slim, solid movie noir that's worth when you do not know Fuller (it's a bit less bizarre than some of his later work).
