Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jos√© Iturbi starring in "Anchors Aweigh" directed by George Sidney. Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two sailors on holiday in Hollywood. They meet a young boy (Dean Stockwell) and when they take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls to her. She wants an audition by Jose Iturbi. He's trying to help, but it's a mix. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse in a wonderful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My heart sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. Sinatra tries to show his versatility, and why the girls are bawling with these big blue eyes and the boy's face. It was a big break for MGM for Kelly. <br /> <br /> Amazing movie, very exciting.
