A great movie that shows an unusual genre mix in just eight minutes: a mystery, a thriller, a musical. In short, we have the opportunity to tell the story: the girl comes to a European café and then ... A soft passage from absurd secrets into narrative logic. In no time, without Vigalondo being able to take black and white ideas through imagination and despite (thanks) the most difficult budget. <br /> <br /> Because of the unity of time space, the film gets the intensity of a short poem (almost haiku). Spain, a country of fast poetry in B / W (remember Buñuel soon?) You must see to soften our belief in a young cinema outside the states.
