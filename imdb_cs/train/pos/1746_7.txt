Bela Lugosi plays one of his rare volunteer roles in a series based on a long-lived radio hit (which was also a source of a feature film where Lugosi played a villain.) Lugosi cut off a subtle figure and is sad he did not get more roles to be a good guy. Here Chanda returns from the east to help Princess Nadja, who is hunted by the Ubasti cult leader, who needs her to bring the cousin's priestess dead. This is a good-looking serial series that is very fun. To be sure, it's a little relaxed, like one of the directors (producing studio rhythms) and then a training adventure, but it's still nice. It plays better than two feature films cut out of it because it allows things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling humiliated or feeling like "I miss something". One of the trilogies of three good series was Lugosi, others were SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
