It's a great American martial arts movie. The combat scenes were quite impressive for American films from the 1990s. Of course, combat scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong movies, in fact, few American films are fighting scenes that are as good as those in Honk Kong, even today. When you look at the American martial arts movie, you expect to see less impressive combat scenes, but you still have some nice moves that can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least that's what I expect from these films. The movie made me stunned. Some combat scenes were really impressive, acting, direction and plot were good enough, so it's really good to watch the movie if you like American American martial art from the 90's.
