The story of Mrs. Duke about her life and the fight with manic depression was just like my life struggle. I saw that I behaved just like her. I was amazed at the similarities of our lives to include sexual abuse that we both endured as children. I saw the film when he first spoke in 1990 and I loved this film so much. Anyone struggling with manic depression could get so much from this film. It does not matter whether she was awarded a prize or what they were for. It is not here. The question is, how Mrs. Duke had a disease and struggled to survive and overcome. Mrs. Duke has many successes in the struggle for the survival of the disease, which often leaves many victims without hope. If one does not personally attempt this disease, they do not know the heck they have to live with. The film for me was successful because it showed real problems and how a person who is depressed and manic. It was so real ... so, really. It was like looking at myself on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I personally thank Mrs Duke for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
