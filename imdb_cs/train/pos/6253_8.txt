This movie is great. As is often heard, it is really realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, obviously I do not think it is depressing, negative, or analyzing Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary: While in HUNDSTAGE there are really some very difficult scenes and some characters are called very bad people, you are also watching love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls. And that's exactly what HUNDSTAGE distinguishes me from other films that have tried to show the lives of "ordinary people" intensely and realistically; their cloud, desires and darkness: Seidl apparently never attempts to prove that the lives of the people of the working class are garbage! In my opinion, the audience who came to this conclusion is very afraid to accept that almost no one lives is "pure" and "normal", as we would like other people to believe. And that every living person has his dark and often depressed parties. The most beautiful scene: An old Viennese man looking at his old girl dancing the "oriental way" as he calls it. I think anyone who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and has to ask himself what it is, that is proto-fascist: The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70-year-old woman dance all her spells for your lover.
