I'm tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly subject to watching Nickelodeon, Disney, and so on. Everything seems to be the same old tired cartoons over and over again. When my daughters could not go to the trade fair tonight because one of them was sick, I just wanted to rest and relax for a while. I turned the TV over and looked for something else, overturned the channels. My finger stopped watching the channel when I heard Harvey's voice. I admire every single thing this guy did, and when I saw he was doing the voice work for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately enchanted by the cartoon, and the more we watched the show together, the more I loved her with the news that was portrayed. It is not necessarily a partisan for "gay rights", but rather for anyone who has ever been alert as a child for NICU. I had friends who were chosen for one thing or another ... too thick, too thin, too feminine, to be a rapist who is not smart enough, has only one parent ... you name it! Children can be very cruel as a result, so I was glad to see a fun caricature that actually delivered LIFE MESSAGE to their listeners. My girls have already accepted others as they are, and they do not choose others for difference. My elder daughter is actually up against her friends if they are picked up (once she has one mom and that little girl is picked quite often - it warms my heart when Kassie is behind her!). > <br /> So, those of you who convict this show because you feel it's a lawyer for "gay rights", or you were forced to "accept certain opinions," you clearly and completely missed the point of this painful little cartoon series . <br /> <br /> And if you need it, he explained to you ... you need more help than if some TV shows could ever be offered.
