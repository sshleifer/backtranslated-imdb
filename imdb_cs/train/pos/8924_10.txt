This movie is amazing. What separates it from sci-fi for the next 50 years is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, eyes, nothing but can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this film will not be held in a few days, going on one night, which probably takes place before midnight. It's also scary that once the drop comes to you, you can not get it off. you are stuck in it because it dissolves your body and slowly massages your body. My favorite 50th film science fiction and what is sometimes considered essential. I see why he did it to Steve McQueen. All this and a catchy song! How can you go wrong?
