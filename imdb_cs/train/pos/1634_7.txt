First I caught the film on my first run at HBO in (probably) 1981 and 15 years I thought the movie was cheerful. I remember not seeing Alfred E. Neuman in the theater trailers. When the magazine MAD emptied the film and abruptly stopped with an apology from the "usual gang" that they barely let go of that bullshit, I just thought they were enjoying themselves, which I'm sure they are, but they really find them Ron Liebman) so embarrassed to remove their names from some credits, I was quite surprised. Certainly there are a lot of worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on the video now (at the age of 32) with MAD links restored, I still get kicked out of it. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his coronation jewel performance (Say it again)
