While I do not consider myself a great fan of fairy-tale films, Stardust was fascinated by seeing Michelle Pfeiffer as a villain on the trailer (especially since I wanted to see her as Velma Von Tussle's head in Hairspray). Guy, she's so convincingly evil as a witch, especially with her ancient make-up at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who is forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Like all actors such as Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, and many others are working well. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classical beauties, there are also the wonderful faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we meet her for the first time. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the head of Tristan and looked just like his dad Dunstan as a young man who thought it was in the early stages with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments compare it to the Princess Bride and while I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB you always knew it was just an imaginary story that the old man says to his grandson. Stardust will most likely believe that what you see and hear can really happen even with all the fun that's happening all over. So I strongly recommend Stardust to this comment.
