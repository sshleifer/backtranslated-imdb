The story of HG Wells' story about the story was filmed in 1935. The story of science fiction about a war that lasts for decades has been very good. The big cast includes Raymond Massey (arsenic and old lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (Ghost Frankenstein) Ralph Richardson (Time Bandits) and Margaretta Scott. Our glimpse of helicopters, holograms, rocket ships and futuristic cities. This film was very enjoyable before the time directed by William Cameron Menzies (invaders from Mars) as the former film capital (1927), but to avoid the so-called continuation of the form of things that arose in 1979. This film has nothing to do with original.hg Wells like Jules Verne had a vision for the future with their stories.A classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10
