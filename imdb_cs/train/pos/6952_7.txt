In New York, when the lover and lonely project manager of design company Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) in the subway, she invites her to the day and dine with him. Jenny immediately falls in love with him, has sex, and she reveals her true identity, says she is the mighty superhero of G-Girl. After meeting with her coworker and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needed Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of her best friend, Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson), who breaks and breaks her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell while Hannah has a novel. However, archenemy G-Girl and former high school mate Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), suggest Matt to attract Jenny to get rid of her superpowers. "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is wonderfully stupid and funny. This romantic comedy-adventure has many fun moments and is very fun. Luke Wilson is great in the role of idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a confused neurotic superhero reminded of Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in Play Misty For Me. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My super ex-girlfriend")
