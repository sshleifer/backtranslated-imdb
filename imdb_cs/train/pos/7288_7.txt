This film is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was classical Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend alive in the Lasagna Basin in his basement while he travels the city and tries to find her body by checking local chickens. He finally finds the real hourglass body with his head on the top. The cut-off head becomes friends with an unsuccessful experiment in the closet, and the top stands out of the cloakroom and breaks the remaining "good" assistant's shoulder (the other is not correct from an earlier scientist's failure) and the whole site burns. <br /> <br /> The film has scared us so much like children that my friend will not go to his basement for a year after seeing it. As children we considered the most horrible movies of all time and this was the fourth. Only one of those scary films was really good (the original "The Haunting"). I had to give this film seven ratings for the huge amount of entertainment it offers. Its amazing effect due to miserable production and strange sexual anguish when a scientist looks for bodies (complete with a porn audio track), scare the hell out of innocent children, while ridiculous aspects make it the main material for watching talk and laugh. I watched this movie tonight and enjoyed it while I'd rather go to the dentist than watch Chicago. Seven is the most I can give him because his fun is simply lucky. Film, like a cinema, is a disaster.
