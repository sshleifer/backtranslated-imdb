Again and again, I said that if people do not want to make remakes or continue, they should stop seeing and instead go into the world of independent film. I talked about the fact that when I last saw an independent film, I had to be easy six months ago. So here is a review for india that I had my attention on Youtube; Cure. <br /> <br /> Right now, you can say that the film is about an avant-garde film approach that is telegraphed with the use of extreme detail, skophobia and fast editing. He is proud of what he looks like - and he has the right to be. For the most part, it is a very nice little piece, with the exception of one inexcusable ignorance of powers of 180 degrees and a comically bad gun effect, a phenomenon that seems to be a weighting card for own project financing. <br /> <br /> However, despite these amateur mistakes, most pictures are really pleased to look. We have a good use of props and locations, good visual effects and some very atmospheric, fluid adjustments, which is more praiseworthy because it's definitely something you will not see very often at all from Youtube. The conspiracy is fragmented and although the underlying assumption is relatively simple, some can hardly follow exactly what is happening, but what we see here is avant-garde narrative at work; you can not really expect a straightforward structure of three actions, and if you might not be prepared for this kind of movie. Where the film is unlucky, it's a sound. What you hear all the time is a distorted voice that is often faint and even worse, there is continuous music in the background that is undergoing minimal change and does not bring anything. Such attention is paid to the visual that the sound is frankly neglected, and it becomes quite obvious when you realize that you simply missed about four sentences from the narrative and had to come back to pick up what had left you behind your attention. > <br /> So give him a watch, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; was someone else reminded the title page for the film Doug Naylor Red Dwarf "The Last Person" early in the movie? If you have a book, you know what I mean.
