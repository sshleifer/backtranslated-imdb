Me and my girlfriend, Annette, we've been watching together and we'll both comment. We both really enjoyed watching this, even though Dicken's work required some freedom. Many of Dicken's works are somewhat dark and sad (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed everything. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically) and the characters were cheerful. TRAVIS: Under normal circumstances, I really care about music and dance films, but the melodies in this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was amazing. ANNETTE: That really says a lot from Travis. I can not really emphasize how good dance numbers really are. For example, you can say that these boys really worked to get the routines to perfection. TRAVIS: Three actors really excelled IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). A man that Oliver Reed can really make a good villain. The only scene in which you can see his eyes through the post has caused me to cool down ... AWESOME. And Jack Wild was a perfect artificial cheater. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when they killed her). Legend! Kudos to separate casts on their choice there. I hated Oliver Twista child. It was just whimpering and funny to my taste. (I still wished Bill Sikes to get rid of mud during the persecution). And they would not even sing him. ANNETTE: The efficiency was really great. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) had done a tremendous job. It was so funny and slightly ominous. Supporting actors were also great. Harry Secombe played Mr. Bumble's great role. And she has a wonderful singing. I saw Mr. Sekom in another film called "Davy", where he played an opera singer with pleasant results. The talented Harry Secombe was supposed to be in many more movies. TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not entirely true of the book, but the IMO was much more robust. This movie was also not boring, as some musicals seem to be. And continuity kept you moving along with the characters. The melody did not damage the conspiracy or let you sleep too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any musical film Travis will see is a rare find. And this is a really rare finding. This is a very easy-to-follow production that transmits the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. The day when all the movies seem to be effects combined with nice faces, it was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating was 8.5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: ) irritated me and his songs tortured my very sensitive ears. Otherwise it was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. The movies will not get much better than this. And you can say that everyone involved in this production really worked hard to do what it was ... a masterpiece. Please do not miss this one ... even if you do not like musicals. It's a really rare treatment.
