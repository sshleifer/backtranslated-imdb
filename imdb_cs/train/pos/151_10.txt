The film is designed to affect the audience, and this film has left me speechless. Beautifully photographed and well-behaved with a dialogue that approaches film poetry includes lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and fraud. It weave an intense web that let me take my eyes off the screen until the final credits. The story is sweeping. He chooses the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War on the human wrecks that have remained. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who control the screen. Supportive players are excellently busy and offer a true sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and cinema are great. Absolutely love the photo.
