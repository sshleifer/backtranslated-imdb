I recently looked at it, but when it started, I did not know what the concept was, what was the theme ..... just - I did not know what it was. It was a documentary, it was a routine comedy ..... Well, that was both. <br /> <br /> It started a bit slow, but I think it was because I did not even know what type of program I was looking at. But it quickly pushed me. The episode I watched was Robert Wuhl in the history of a discussion of fact and fiction. Just how we (the Americans) are learning history that is not really true - and how we should learn what we have done. He did it so that the audience would entertain and enjoy. In fact, I have learned a few things and this is a real indicator of how effective this type of program can be. I would like to see this as a series for HBO. I think it can be as entertaining and effective with a number of themes - especially if "learning" is the same way as this episode.
