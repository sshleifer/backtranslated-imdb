When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was the movie that was more like anime than film. The reason is that they are vampires who make incredible pieces. Stunts are very similar Matrix moves like moving too fast on bullets something and jumping around very far. Another reason why I'm a good movie is that the adorable anime of the faces they do during the movie. The way Gackt does his pilgrimage faces, or just how they behave, VERY ANIME. I think it's really a good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde is also 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you have to see it.
