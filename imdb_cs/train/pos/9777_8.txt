one of the best low-budget films from Germany! is it a dark side of the new age? if you believe in esoteric, please do not watch this movie! blows up all your positive fantasies. this film shows that the world of extreme offenses and terror lies behind the peaceful fa√ßade of the spiritual search for souls. I hope it will soon be a 35mm copy! The first film, Andreas Marschall, is just the beginning of a new field and makes films with a few euros! I'm waiting for another hit!
