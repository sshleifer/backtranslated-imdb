A pretty hearty little movie and not just for kids. John Thaw is always great (without any hint of Inspector Morse). The boy who played William did a good job, although I did not think he was convincing in every scene. I loved the whole feeling of a small village and a slower pace of life in those times. I also felt the scenes in London where I was historically accurate if I did. He reminded me of the Scandinavian film I saw a few years ago called Mother of Mine. This film was a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during the Second World War. The woman of the family who brought him asked for a girl because (as it turned out) she lost her daughter. The boy ignores it instead. The fact that a boy speaks Finnish is even more complicated. I highly recommend that the movie feel the same to everyone who enjoys Goodnight Pan Tom.
