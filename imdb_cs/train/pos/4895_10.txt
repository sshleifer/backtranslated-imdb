It's rare to sit in front of a TV and watch a program. It's even more rare when I actually enjoyed the program, but the last of the blonde bombers was one of the best movies I thought I'd seen. Notable acting, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and a great, funny and tangible script that combines to be truly a rewarding experience. I can not really say how much I thought it was so, so I will not try, I'll just say if you get the opportunity, PLEASE! I just hope it comes out on the video.
