to communicate in the film of essential things of life - like what life is, does it make sense? - it is absolutely impossible. Of course, possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every movie (story), but communication requires direct attraction to consciousness. This happens if the input from the senses overcomes the "input" from our mind, ie our thoughts. Several directors know how to communicate basic things. Tarkovsky is one. His "Stalker" shows the images of existence, communicates life as it turns out, and yet escapes the mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same thing.
