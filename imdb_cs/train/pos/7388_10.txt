74. The Oscars were very good. Whoopi's work like EmCee was very fun and light. I personally loved her last idea, which, because of the tongue and the woeful jokes, has become a frigid review, but that's fine. They seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier did it as an Oscar-like show they remembered. <br /> <br />
