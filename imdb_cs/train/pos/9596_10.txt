This film documents the transformative experience for a group of young men, and the tracking experience is transformative for the viewer itself. Several films even strive for this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film - documentary or dramatic - that will do it. There is no other film in which both of us would laugh and cry so much. Yes, it is DMD and accessible travel; As far as problems are concerned, it is a useful business, but it is more. This is a friendship. It's about living alone, about living everyday that you are alive. And it's a great, fun, adventurous story. That's why God created a cinema! Watch this movie !!!
