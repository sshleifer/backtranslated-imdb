Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who stops for a thousand miles to visit his absent millionaire father (a haunting Ray Wise) on a large windmill driven ranch, and eventually embroiled in the dangerous strip of his young, sneaky and seductive stepmother from hell Wren), causing trouble for the dysfunctional family. A gorgeous, stylish and exciting drama that was not promoted and sent directly to VHS and cable television - where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, cleverly controlled and thoroughly directed from the scenario that keeps you biting your nails. I can not believe that reviewers who did not like that have ever seen it. This is an undiscovered classic.
