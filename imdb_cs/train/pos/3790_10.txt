I hit randomly on an independent movie channel and riveted. I'm a professional actor and I was impressed with the performance. They felt totally improvising, totally uninfluenced. I could not say if it was a script or how it was shot and waited until the end to see the credits and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director also made a very fine film called Everyday People, which I liked a lot. The damage to the film is that the manifestations of this excellent do not reach the distributions and ads they deserve and live under radar. This film deserves a high and proud flying. I urge people to check it out and watch it.
