As another IMDB reviewer remarked, this movie starts a bit slow but progresses much better. Yes, they are Roger Corman, and yes, they go over some of the thematic reasons as much higher budget predecessors, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of a woman's career as a rising blues singer against the marriage loneliness assembly and his almost freudian need to fill emotional and physical "emptiness" or "holes" while she away along with clever use of minimal effects and setting is nicely done. Using a very small number of places and characters, and the use of water in almost every scene, as a cleansing and utoping metaphoric symbol around the world, this film, though apparently suffering from a small budget, reminds me in many respects of a newer scenario, namely the French film "BAZÃ‰NY "which seems at least a good way to borrow some useful ideas from" UP against AMANDA ". With a smaller set of instruments, UP against AMANDA maintains its tension with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of giving up occasional chandelier temptations but achieving it the same or better as other films in this genre. Cutting Amanda's misuse in the past (again very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other audiences about an unexpected and compassionate response to the Amanda situation that raises this aspect of the story. Cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
