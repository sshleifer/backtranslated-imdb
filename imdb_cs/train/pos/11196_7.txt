One-Round Jack Sander is called because it's a carnival boxer fighting with any man in the audience. If they can last one lap, they will win the prize - a favorite way to attract customers to traveling exhibitions long ago. Jack is in love with Girls' Ticket, Mabel, though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring and tries his chances with Jack. What nobody knows about the fight is that Bob is a champion, so he is able to defeat Jack - though it takes him some work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and surrender to the carnival circuit. Later Jack improves enough to become a legitimate boxer. He's slowly developing until he's ready to go to Champ. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Champ and Mabel begin to swing behind Jack's back - even though Mabel has since taken Jack. So when the ultimate fight is between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is that good enough? Will a justified rage be raised against Bob, or would he defend his performance? Tune in and see. This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and today this film seems to be strange to a director known for mysterious movie footage, in 1920, Hitchcock had no firm genre, which he drove or wrote (he for both films did both). In fact, this film is in many ways more testimony to Hitchcock's quiet style, a rather similar plot appeared in one of his other silent, THE MANMAN (also playing Carl Brisson as a damaged husband). So even though it seems to be a lot like a standard boxing day, it was not a radical departure of this great director - even with his rather ending formula. Overall, although it's a bit predictable and when Ian Hunter plays the boxing champion, he looks stupid, the movie works well. While far from perfect silence, it is worth seeing and packing a nice blow.
