I really enjoyed this movie. He did something to do with just few movies now; provided family values ​​while having fun. Nancy Drew is a hero for all generations and a model model for the young girls they are looking for. The little girls I was with enjoyed the film and kept talking about Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think that parents are bored to sit in the theater. No, she will not win an Oscar, and it's not spectacular special effects or even a spooky, spooky secret, but I enjoyed it and it became true to the spirit of books. I would definitely recommend this film to someone who has a young girl (she will love her!) Or any fan of books. You will not be disappointed.
