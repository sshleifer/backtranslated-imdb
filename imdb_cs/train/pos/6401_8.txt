Reverend men have many great aspects. Good action sequences, lots of "good feel" scenes, good musical scores, but the part that really does the movie is great acting. Mostly Robert Deniro. The story of honest men focuses on Carl Brashear, who plays Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American deep-sea diver in the navy. He chronicles his harsh struggle to get a poor farmer into a diving school and beyond. It's a good story, but it seems to have happened many times. Man, against all possible chances, will not give up until he accomplishes his goals, which many years ago gave for some sentimental reason. It could have happened, but the many battles Brashear faces in the film are controversial, including C.O. from a diving school that has become his last test. However, all this is done for the scene when Robert Deniro eventually enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, who is a teacher at the Brashear diving school. Once Deniro arrives, he will omit this atmosphere of extreme arrogance that you can not hate unless you have the incredible power of the spirit. Before the movie ends, Deniro makes a few speeches that you'd laugh at as well, but you're too surprised to get out of the way. Finally, you have to doubt some aspects of the movie, but admit that if it were true, you should reject it within the first twenty minutes.
