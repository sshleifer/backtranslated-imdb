RKO had a reputation for producing the folk, homemade pieces of the Americans. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) has been in movies since she was a toddler. Until 1933 she was unconscious - she played Ann Dvořák as a child in "Three for the Match" (1932) and "Flower Girl" in both "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" as in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr Recalled Anne's Work from the previous movie and so got this part. She also accepted Anne Shirley as her stage name. Unforgettable stories are here - Lady of Shallot in the leak of the ship, a "stolen" brooch, an incident of "red hair". Anne had such a role for the role of a shy, hearty orphan. Her heart was intense, her desire to please her, and her fiery mood. OH Heggie was great because the understanding of Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who also had a small child in the movies, was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play a band other than Aunt Millie in Andy Hardy's show, Mrs. Barry.
