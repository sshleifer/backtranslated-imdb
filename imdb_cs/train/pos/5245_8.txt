I thought this movie was LOL funny. It's fun, I will not take seriously, a movie about a man's perceived view of life, love and ... well, ladies, "from a modest bus station to the tip of a d√©butante ... bus station." Tim Meadows plays guy (Leon Phelps), who was raised in the Playboy mansion by Father Hugh Hefner-esquire, surrounded by beautiful models and actresses. When his "father" kicks him up on the street, he has to learn to take care of himself with nothing but a chauvinistic view of the life his teachings have taught him ... and the insuperable, almost mystical level of charm and stupidity of happiness. And so begins hijinx! If you did not see this movie and enjoyed a merry, long, comedy / love story, I suggest you rent a "Ladies Man".
