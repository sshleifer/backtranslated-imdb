I really think this movie is great, personally. But there is plenty in every movie. Now some of you may not have watched Hilary Duff "Raise Your Voice", but if you think about it, these two shows are very similar if you know what I mean. In a "brave new girl" Holly wants so bad to get to the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice' Terri wants to go to the Conservatory in L.A. (it does not remember the name of the Conservatory). Both are in the music field and both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two movies are similar. I personally like "Brave New Girl" better than, "Lift up your voice" though.
