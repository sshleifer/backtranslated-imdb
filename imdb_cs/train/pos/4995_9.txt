I do not think most of us will tend to apply the term "must-see" to action movies, but I was very impressed at how good this movie was and deserves to be "must-see". /> <br /> Mandy by Shannon Lee, daughter of late and big Bruce Lee and late-sister Brandon Lee, is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who helps pull a diamond robbery in the Criminal Syndicate Museum and get it nicely rewarded. Few know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of turtle doves) who prematurely refused Mandy and Martin to come to an agreement are also planning to steal a diamond. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As every couple of thieves are planning a robbery, it's exciting to watch. Things will melt away because Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself based on these thieves because they find that they need to stay alive from a criminal syndicate who are not happy that the diamond is not in hand. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed because there is a good dose of weapon battles, martial arts and hand combat sequences. <br /> <br /> What's surprising that it's not just the action that carries this movie but the romance and laughs (and I do not mean your typical unicorns that are prevalent in action movies) that are interwoven in. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to roam for bad guys, but we see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they are developing. A great movie and one NO <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
