A sweet little movie that would not have damaged your grandmother, "Saving Grace," looks like he has been carved from the same stuff as a half dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... Underdog is confronted with anger, learns about himself in the process . <br /> <br /> The widow and so broke, Grace is a master gardener and is assigned to help her friend / staff mate Matthew grow a plant. He's doing it all wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that he is the perfect person trying to reap pots from which they can both benefit. He has a smoking, needs to get funds to pay a mortgage. <br /> <br /> Highlight that Grace travels to London to deal with some goods dressed in what looks like a white suit that John Travolta wore on Saturday Night Fever, and he dropped off as a painful thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always observable and you can not say that about many people .. well, I can not. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, who liked "La Femme Nikita," is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> He is not deeply moving or unobtrusive, but immensely entertaining, and he feels like a walk with his friends for 90 minutes. 8/10.
