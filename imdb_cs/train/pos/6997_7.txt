One thing is certain ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on sad events, followed by a character who must live with sin that he can not cope with. The story cruises you rather than the usual explanation, so you are wondering what's going on. Eventually the points are connected and the performances make sense. All the characters were fine and Wil Smith did a good day in the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that you need to ask a lot of moral questions, but if you just accept and buy into his pain, it's easier to accept what he chooses. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The path you are interested in is quite interesting if it is not overwhelming. A movie good enough that sadly a bit sad at the end. I would recommend this movie if you like the sort of thing you need to think about and not just look at explosions and struggles.
