The beginning of this movie is a bit clumsy and also confused, but sit tight because you are on your way to your life. The concept is convincing, with interesting devices used to tell the whole story. There are gentle performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's best of cast - no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves a very strong performance. Mr Lumet's direction is excellent. The film's 1970s feel that the risks are taken in the narrative about this story, but unlike most trite movies that now inhabit the landscape, it's a thriller that is frankly based on relationships rather than on special effects or product drawers. You will be very rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
