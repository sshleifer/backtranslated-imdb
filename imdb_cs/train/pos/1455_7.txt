Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film that shows how two cultures have a lot in common, but they do not even realize the influence that each society has on itself. David Redmon will open your eyes and let you see how Chinese workers make beads that cost only a few and are sold in America for as little as $ 20. When Redmon challenges the Americans about where the beads come from, they had no trace and seemed stupid. When he told them they were made in China for less than anything with terrible salaries and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans looked sad, injured and a little imprisoned, but they did not seem to stop buying beads after finding out the truth. When Redmon challenged workers in China, they did not know Americans were wearing their neck and paying so much for these beads. The workers laughed at what was behind the bead for purpose and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something we are talking about in other countries than ours. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
