This is probably the best performance of John Thaw, where he successfully shakes all his features of Inspector Morse's character and brings the perfect adaptation of Tom from the book's pages to the television screen. It is a well-produced production that maintains its family atmosphere despite some very mature themes such as the outbreak of World War II and physical abuse of the child. However, it is the relationship between Tom and Young Willie, that is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this relationship between the young boy who was evacuated from London and the annoying old man who is still unfolding - a combination of a real grandfather / grandson. It's a shame that this story was not made with a bigger budget with an amplified director that belongs to a big screen that is not shown once or twice every ten years on Sunday afternoon. With respect to the right leadership, John Thaw will be celebrated around the world and awarded many awards for his great performance in this film. A great actor and a great role to be more appreciated than at that time.
