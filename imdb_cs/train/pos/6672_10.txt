I saw Mystery Men who intimidated a little wand in the press and the general public (for example imdb), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more entertaining than most of the films, definitely milder than most so-called comedy films and very "smart" . <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent; Greg Kinnear is as good as Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo with Ricky Jay is the perfect "spoiled movie star" and he imbues his character with the right balance in the quality of comic books and realism to relieve himself. <br /> <br /> I admit there's a lot of flashes on the places and visuals, maybe at the expense of another characterization, but at the end of the day it's a high-profile movie - it's small moments, "What's up, Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many great movies in this movie to make it worthwhile to make it happen again.
