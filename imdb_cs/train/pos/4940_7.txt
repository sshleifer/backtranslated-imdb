This film is about human relationships. Charming, fun and well written, with meaningful text. It seems Morgan Freeman is sure to be entertained on stage. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and clever woman. I like it very much. A woman like her is a good motivation to learn Spanish. From the moment Morgan Freeman meets cute Paz Vega, there's a look at an intimate journey with two strangers who learn where their lives are. 10 items or less is about life. If you like this movie, check out The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. It's not an action movie or naked comedy. It's all about human relationships.
