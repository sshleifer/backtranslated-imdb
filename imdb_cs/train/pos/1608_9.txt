Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensational this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could act? Who has ever heard about Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison a director. The only really flat notes in this wonderful work are: "When the Moon touches your eye like a big pizza cake, that's Amore," a song that sings too many times in the film (one too many) and has a long community in popular music . <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with a groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) pledges to offer her ring ring as a substitute for the engagement ring, and then goes to Sicily to be with her dying mother. He pays Loretto a fee when he sees his stolen brother Ronny attending a wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. Everything at the end works because it inevitably works in films of this genre. Meanwhile, all actors admire and the audience has their own. In its way, Moonstruck is how Hollywood has become the best: giving fun without any social significance. If they just lost "It's Amore," it would be perfect.
