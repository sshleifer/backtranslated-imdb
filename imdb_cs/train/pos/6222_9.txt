It really is a great movie. Some songs have become immortal classics, and Fred and Ginger's dances are among their best in history. But basically all Fred and Ginger films are the same. When singing and dancing are over, they are the other characters in the movie who are working on the film. What really bothers me, why are all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the film's partial film is the reason I look at it again and again. He adds to this film that he will not touch it. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is in my top ten favorite lists. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very nice and could get to the top on some occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's films had conspiracies that depended on other actors to fill the space between musical numbers, otherwise the film would have to shorten by half an hour. I just want Randy to appreciate more people and I felt the need to stand up to him.
