Wow! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte! This girl is not just a wonderful face, she's funny and really really talented! I wanted to laugh many times only by being very harsh with Viktor, who had desperately touched her! In the coming years, we will see a lot ... and probably also from director Petr Sollett and co-stars Victor Rasuk! Victor Vargas lifting is one of the best movies I've seen a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, nice, funny, well shot, it has everything: good story, good actors, good movie direction! If you like simple, slow, real life, urban movies, Girl from Kevin Smith, you love Victor Vargas! It's better!
