This film is a fun and totally sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was overwhelmed by taking pictures of vivid colors and pointy settings, especially when you think this is Zukovic's first big attempt. One warning, do not take the movie seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and that's not a compliment). The report is a rather stylized post-college, a neo-photic look at society. I liked the basic line of the fictitious zinc conspiracy verbally scaring the mobs of the 1990s.
