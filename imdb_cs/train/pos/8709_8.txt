Recently (May 2008) I found out that this child's favorite was available as a DVD. Although I've seen a great deal of high-quality movies since then (in the late 1970's, I was 10 in 1978), these three episodes, low budgets, are still strong. <br /> <br /> I looked at it with a ten-year-old daughter, and she's just the way I remembered since then: spooky music (she had to hold her hand, even though she was raised by watching LotR and Resident Evil) changing theories about who is the culprit, and also to complain about the theater voices of the period before Norway discovered the difference between acting and film acting. This is the only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in Norway. And still worth watching.
