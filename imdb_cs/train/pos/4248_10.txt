there's a story, but more importantly, the world of this movie starts in chaos and is fine within ten minutes. It is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion about objective truth and good. posing along the axis unchecked in the previous cinema, this film should be taught in every high school. <br /> <br /> * CHIASMUS *
