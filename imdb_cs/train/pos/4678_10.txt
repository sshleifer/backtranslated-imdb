I decided to watch this movie in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best films at the festival. Both main actors give a well-rounded, sensitive performance that seems to correspond to characters on a personal level. The director has done a great job of bringing characters and a life story with skills that are not usually seen at the first production. One interesting aspect of this film is love to work with wood and New York City (Specifically Brooklyn). The film revolves around family furniture that makes business and weaves fine cinematography of both Joinery and Brooklyn's common life? again to the director of this fine choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I really would like to recommend it (I'm sure it will do it on screen).
