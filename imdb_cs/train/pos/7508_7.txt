Great work by Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopsies that came to the screen at some point. While it covers most of Betty's young life, he will also be able to stay on the most focused tour, which is probably the most biographical film. Dialogue and acting is a beautiful and alarming subtext. This movie is an excellent break from Dir. "American Psycho," and I think it will be her best work. Oh, and as a cinematic fan, I give the film 100% in the cinema. It was amazing how well the look of the 1950s with modern film stores was lost. Accolades na D.O.P. Everything around is very pleasant. I recommend taking a look at it: 8/10.
