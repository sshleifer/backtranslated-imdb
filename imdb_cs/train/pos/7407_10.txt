This film surprised me completely. I looked at it twice or three times. I really liked this movie. There were many truths that raised this film. I love all the characters in this movie as well. This movie makes a lot of sense because society "becomes more advanced" What does it mean that culture loses? It would not sound like that. I can really connect with this movie from a baby hood and lose my life, which never returns or was never the same. This movie is on my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is just such a raw truth that I feel when I look at the film and it's not the truth that you have to kick right in front of your face. The creators of this film did a great job and I really liked this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
