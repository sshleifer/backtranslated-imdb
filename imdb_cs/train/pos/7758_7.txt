Overcrowded melodrama typical for its period (mid-1950s) and suitable matin√©e food. Rock Hudson, who always falls in love, plays his usual stereotypical role, but in Giant who made this film the same year this year when his material and stars (Taylor & Dean) are not good enough to raise the caliber for a sinful story about how hard it is to be rich and happy. A self-defeating brother and sister (Robert Stack, who sneaks through a movie in a drunken pitome and Dorothy Malone, playing a winning poor little rich girl totally over the top) ends up defeated and Hudson gets Bacall - which is rather wooden in this part, a joke to take her away. If you want to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a good end happy and badly unlucky, that's the meaning of fiction. But I wanted to read that the film is based on a true story that justified the conspiracy. Just like other films of the time, homosexuality is covered in a heterosexual concept. Perhaps the film could be a remake: Stack's character would sound truer if he hid homosexual feelings when Mitch got married. Todd Haynes Far From Heaven has improved dramatically to All That Heaven Allows, also directed by Sirka. Maybe Haynes can remake in writing on the wind and give us a really unforgettable movie.
