Why this movie has everything but disappeared into the unknown is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only sword and witch better movie. Brutal violence, cool characters and good stimulation make this one of the best fantasies. It's definitely the biggest adult-animated movie I've ever seen. It's not like Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It is quite a departure for Bakshi and, in my opinion, his best job. I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.
