Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who goes to police or illegal gambling (for reasons I do not think clear). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-threshold criminal who walks into the hall and spends his spare time with envied Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony gets arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where he forms a bond that does not have to be friendship, but now he's going to do it. <br /> <br /> This movie came under the name "Frank and Tony," which is a disappointment because I can see that it's called "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony," which would help sell the movie more efficiently. I suppose it's a homage to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film "Violent Professionals" and I have to say that they both complement each other well. Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values, a real school with this film. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie that unfairly demotes the b-film (or worse). With cleaner sound and picture it could be Hollywood hit, I think. The story was very interesting, characters (and actors) better than the average and, unlike "violent professionals", the plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime movies you should try. A movie about the crowd that really is from Italy (how much more authentic you want?) There is as much as you can ask. Sure, it's not the Godfather, but it should not be. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy action comrade ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from a bad guy's point of view. Well, well, not really. If nothing else, this film wanted to look at me for more films from the director and casting the principle. Films next to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and customary cult films. Even more fun than finding a lost classics?
