A Chinese scholar who harshly criticizes the arrogant nationalist and persistent policy of ruling crises around the emperor in pre-war Japan is accused of being a "communist" and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and his thoughts, remains alone to save the family from starvation. This film is a huge statue built in praise of the role of mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no more powerful in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she did not get the Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. She went to a young girl with a very limited game potential. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and most "human" feature is a must see for all "true children" on Earth.
