"Who did it?" contains many laughter and gags. It's not just one of the best films Stooges with Shemp, it's one of Columbia's finest short comedies. Director Bernds originally wrote a screenplay in 1946 for Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke ending, it was adapted for the Columbia comic team by Schilling and Lane (their release was released as "Pardon My Terror.") Of course it was too good, before Stooges passed, eventually shooting Stooges at the end of 1947. The old man, Goodrich, called the detective, Shemp, Larry and Moe, for fear of being assassinated. When he arrives at his home, Goodrich disappears, and his niece and various men are trying to get rid of Stog. Will they find Goodrich and bring their nieces and perpetrators to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially fun in this movie. His reaction after receiving mickey by Christine McIntyre is excellent; he gives his trademark a sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other Fun Scenes: A detailed view of Moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and a struggle in the dark with all involved representatives. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual character finders shown in the movie Stooges. With his twisted hair, he managed to get to Stooge if he did not get out over everyone else! "Who did it?" is a jewel between Stooges and Shemp. Even deadly fans of Curly are looking forward to this! The true classic Stooge. 9 out of 10.
