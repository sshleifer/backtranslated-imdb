I went to this film for the performance and cast crew, because my friend, who is a film producer, invited me. Forget what you've seen in your ads, forget what you've heard, and look at this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised. In the world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, Day 6, Unbreakable, comes the movie that's worth your hard earned money! Famous scenes, gorgeous cinematography and cast you want to eat with your heart. I have found that this is one of the most important orchestral films and reasons. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar nod. If you could give Oscar to everyone who was involved in it, it would be a movie.
