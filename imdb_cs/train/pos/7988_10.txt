I'm still troubled by family and friends because of tears over movies and were not disappointed when I watched it. I have cried many times, but believe me it was not over despair. I hurt for my family and I hurt for this man when he tried to redeem the only way he knew how. Denzel was as wonderful as ever, just like Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize it; years were not kind to him. My husband is not the one who watches films unless they are historically accurate war films (snore !!!!) At that time, I was watching this movie five times, and I will have to watch the DVD again, pull out the tape and leap all the time I watched.
