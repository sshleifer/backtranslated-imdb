This is an above-average Jackie Chan movie, due to fantastic finale and great humor, but other than that it's nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool and the movie is fun all over the world, and Jackie Chan is just amazing in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had a fantastic chemistry together and they're both very fun! And I thought the main opponent looked really horrible, but the dubbing was just terrible! Character development is above this average above average! And the main fight is just fantastic !, Plus some of the shocks that Jackie takes in this are cruel! There are a lot of really silly and noisy humor, but I enjoy it and the end is funny, plus all the characters are pretty decent. It's pretty cheap, but generally very well done, and while it does not have a lot of fighting you'd expect from Jackie Chan, it's enough to watch you, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), playing with a rifle and it goes out! This is an above-average Jackie Chan movie, due to the fantastic finale and great humor, but other than that it's nothing great, it still costs a lot of watches! Direction is good. Jackie Chan has a good job with a fixed camera, fantastic angles, and most keeps the film at a fast pace. The game is very good! Jackie Chan is awesome as ever, and she's great, she's incredibly sympathetic, cheerful, as usual, doing crazy pieces, having a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicking the ass and playing this awesome rough figure, was awesome! , I just wanted them to stop dubbing! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he's also a very good fighter. The rest of the cast makes OK I think. Overall, it is worth watching! *** of 5
