PRC, which was the lowest of the really low-hit gold with this moody little thriller. Just like a year ago, they've done "Detour," which is probably one of the best low-budget movies ever shot. "Strangler" is basically a one hundred film full of fog and shadows, a technique used by most studies of poverty to hide files or their lack. But here it works well. Charles Middleton's spirits (better known as Ming the Merciless) look around the swamp and kill those involved in his unlawful execution for murder and bring compassion from the viewer. His last victim is the Ferryman's daughter ... he concentrates his anger not only on those who are directly involved in his fate, but also on relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche makes his usual imitation a comedian who goes through his acting style. She is offered to strangle to stop killing, but as a face for the audience, the strangle sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to another, somewhat punished. If Ulmer (who directed the "Detour") directed the Strangler, it should hang from the nearest tree, and the work of the stranger would be done. But who is complaining? It is not a story that is the main attraction, but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general mood of the work. It stands for a "turn-off" as the best day of China
