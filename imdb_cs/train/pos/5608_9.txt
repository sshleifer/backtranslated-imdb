Sure, after this film it became very uneven, but from "Knife in the Water" to "tenant" Roman Polanski could always count on adding something fascinating and unique. Despite many of the themes that have been released (theft, paranoia), none of his films are really similar. The story is somewhat similar to his own "forgiveness" ten years ago, but the tone is quite different. "The tenant" can balance the darker than the dark absurdity (I'm a bit hesitant about calling myself humor even though the protagonists of bizarre behavior and dialogue were sometimes fun) with some really exciting paranoia. Polanski has always been a master in building anxiety, and moments in this movie are almost unbearably creepy. The whole weird nature of the movie is also a plus. In addition to Polanski's outstanding usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. Polanski's actor is often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his acting really captures his characters clumsiness and the feeling of being thrown out. Topics of social discrimination make this film more than just a peculiarity because it is weird. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially the sympathetic turn of Isabel Adjani and Melly Douglas and Shelley Winters, which are quite unpleasant. "The tenant" is often underestimated because of how people are prepared to acclaim praise for both "forgiveness" and "Rosemary's child," but it is as brilliant as any of the classics. (9/10)
