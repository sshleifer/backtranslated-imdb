First I read a book when I was a young teenager and then I saw the film late one night. About a year ago I looked at IMDb and found out that no copies were available. Then I came across the site and found the sites War Film offers, so I'm glad I did, ordered a copy and sat down and confirmed why I wanted to see it again. In my opinion, to really enjoy the movie, I suggest you read a copy of the book and then look at the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I watched over E-bay, Alan White was a Commando / Parachutist during World War II involved in a variety of secret operations, and it was his first book. It's written by someone who knows, and I believe this fact gives the book and the authenticity of the film. I did not make the film ten just because of the nature of the movie's end, not as good as a book. There are several parts of the plot that differ from the book, which is odd, because the book does not relate to the great awareness of the war, but to the individual in the war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have a copy of the book to let my son read and then a movie to watch it in that order. If you can watch it for a book and a movie, then it is definitely worth it and I just wish it was more accessible so that you could read and see one of my best war films at all!
