Two years have elapsed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. I still enjoyed as much as I did the original though. Some mistakes, which have yet to change Joker, now do not have red lips and look like more black hair and black pupils, but still have Mark Hamill, which is a plus. They made Poison Ivy a more white hint that she became more like a plant and Catwomen looks a lot different and not so "attractive" as she was in the original. Though costumes such as Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrow look bad, especially scary. The show is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work just as it is. He mostly works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drak. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to rescue frequently. Batman has given up his yellow logo and black wallet on his suit and seems to have a little bigger but still kicking his ass. The show is not as good as the original mainly due to some of the modified characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over Edge" can be one of the biggest episodes of Batman, so make sure you check it out. <br /> <br /> Overall 8-9 / 10
