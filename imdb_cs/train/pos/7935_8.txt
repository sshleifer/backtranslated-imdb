Hood of the Living Dead had a lot of lives before he started the loan. First, every game of "... dead people" raises His Holiness Mr. Romer and immediately sets a high standard that many films can not afford to pursue. And secondly, my companion who watched the film had doubts that some urban horror film would surpass the key Leprechaun In the Hood. Live the code. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and warm-hearted zombie movie. Oh, the budget is certainly low and, of course, amateur friends of the cast cast cast, but Hood alive loves the zombie cinema. Cheap? Yeah. But when it's cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and as a replacement parent of her younger brother at night. He's trying to avoid Oakland. But before his planned flight, his brother was shot dead in the drive. Ricky's scientific scientific mind represents a better option than CPR or 911: injection of an experimental regenerative sample from his laboratory. Unfortunately, the little bro wakes up in the ambulance as a bloodthirsty zombie from Oakland! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economic to eat your enemies than to avenge, but then again, I'm a bad judge about the complexity of urban life. (How Poor Judge?) In response to the terrible scene with four men, I noticed "Aha-ha! White T-shirts for everyone to have blood." Economic! I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror. "Jordan replied," No, these are dress gangs. White T-shirts have been forbidden from New Orleans bars for some time as a result. "Oh.) A lot of the movie is set in one's living room, so there's a lot of what's hanging and waiting for the zombies, but the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - it goes beyond its budget. <br /> <br /> Zombie explanation : When you play God, zombies are created! Or maybe: Follow the FDA approved test rules before human experimenting! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the zombie cannon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with the drive. real zombies, the infection spreads through the usual bite, but quite unusual shots in the head do not work - they are the heart attacks that kill Zombies have pulses whose absence proves true death.And these zombies make quite nice jaguar sounds. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar-Noise Little Zombie Brother, of course!
