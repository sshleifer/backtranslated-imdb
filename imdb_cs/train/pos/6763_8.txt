Elegance and class are not always the first words to help you when people (at least people who do such a thing) sit and talk about the movie noir. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, some of the best films from the past, Killers, Lonely, Night, and City, drive a level of elegant sophistication that highlights the moody catchy phrase and its connotations of predictable shadows, fedor and femme-faces. <br /> <br /> "Where the Path Ends," it's quite hard to find a movie - the only copy perhaps in the best manhattan video store was the rough bootleg from the AMC cable channel - belongs to the category with these classics. From the moment the black cloud of the introductory credits passes, the curtain draws on the decaying world of world detective Marc Dixon, and as soon as the moments are passing, it is getting nearer, a dreadful suffocation. <br /> <br /> Sure, he's the well-known "dark-haired cop," but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a disturbed look and an uneasy intensity that makes you as unpleasant as it may seem. Yeah, he's been cheating for a long time, and the newly promoted boss (Karl Malden, a typically robust and commanding expedition) warns him "last time". <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates these turtles too much to stop. And the kid did not want it to come? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He advises him to cool himself for his own good. But instead, he takes things into his hands. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> It's deep with the police, the association and your own partner. Dixon's dubious involvement in the "investigation" of the murder threatens his work and makes him wonder if he is simply the foundation of the one he swore he has brought. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place", can "escape what is it?" /> <br /> When not to turn, he finds that he has practically condemned his unexpected relationship with the seraphic beauty (the amazing Gene Tierney), which seems to be able to transform his infertile bachelor existence into something worth returning home to. <br /> <br /> The movement of this beautiful film is stretched and gripped. A group of writers who contributed to the production shone the high-gloss scenario - the dialogue is elegant without breaking into dated parody feeds, passionate without becoming melodramatic or poor. <br /> <br /> And all these top directions and playing are not too neat or curled to release the emotional hold of the movie. Gene Angel Tierney is an angelic, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. She appears to be an actress with a wide range, and her soft and kind nature is as insignificant as her psychosis in "Leave her to Heaven". The scenes between Tierney and Andrews Dixon are intensifying and touching the closer they seem to be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Not far from the end of his rope, cutting, bumping and exhaustion Dixon sums up his lot: "Innocent people can get into horrible jams," he says. "One fake move and you're over your head." Maybe this movie is so compelling, it makes sense that things are almost wildly bad for someone - especially for someone who is trying so hard to do the right thing - with a small shift in the wind, a bad decision or strike, or , most frightening, due to factors over which you have no control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears and brought them to the surface. "Where the trail ends" makes it realistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the fans of Noir - ANI movie fans - who have not seen this are in amazing treatment.
