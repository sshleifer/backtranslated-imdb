This show was Fabulous. It was intricate and well written, and all the characters talking without spooky candy. Even Jonathan Cake, a loving friend, was sympathetic. Since our broadcast waves are full of crap, like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not like a soap opera. It has always been interesting to see how each character will be associated with other circumstances. It's really unpleasant to finally get a show that will make you think a bit and take it out because of some mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show is likely to be missed by people, but by some very loyal fans.
