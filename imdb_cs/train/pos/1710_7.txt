This film is an accurate copy of a television series on the Indian television channel doordarshan, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", meaning balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job but does not fit the role of "normal" and "third class" guys (as they say in the film). In fact, Shayan Munshi with short hair and no designer clothes should have the role of Abhays, but Shayan simply has no talent to pull him out. I would suggest watching a series if available. It's the same story except when running with a mother of friends and an initial introduction. The act of television actors was much better than these "stars." The only reason filming on the flop is that the director tried to extend the half hour (or 45 minutes) story for 2+ hours. So it must be protracted. Even songs from the feeling of nasal singing can not be compensated. <br /> <br /> These movies are good for lazy Sunday afternoons and are really refreshing if you have not seen the original TV series. Scenario and end of the series was much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ##### ## SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### The end of the original serial series was much stronger when the hero himself made a girl, even thinking she was willing to marry him. He is aware of it and tells her that he does not want to be "repaid" and never helped with this intention. A director or script written in some way could not capture the original end in this movie. The original end would buy the tears of the girl's eyes and the boys would nod to agree. Delivery was simply wrong. But I personally think this is a dubious copy. No credit should be given to the director / screenwriter. The story is amazing and one of the famous novel writers in the PRemchand munshi category. I'm not sure if this is the story of Munshi's predecessor, but many of the other short stories in this series include several lectures by Munshi and other great Hindu writers.
