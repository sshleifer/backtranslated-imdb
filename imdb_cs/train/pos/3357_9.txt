While Rome is cheating on Hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two foreigners stay at home, in a large building and end up with a meeting. She is Sofia Loren, wife of an unhappy servant and mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio spokesman who was released because of his homosexuality. They both need society and understanding, both of them will find themselves in it. <br /> <br /> The film covers a few hours. The color is faded and everything is done with a sound track of military processes and hysterical radio reports. Unfortunately, the Nazi anthem - Horst-Wessel-Lied - eventually becomes a romantic musical motif. A beautiful movie, a superb recreation of a special time in Italian history and a sad, sad story. Mastroianni are as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren does a great job, very far from the usual truck driver, the Naples fish people. Do not miss it.
