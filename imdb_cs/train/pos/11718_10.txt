Those who love Elizabeth, as I did in her duties in the movie late at night, will love this movie - she's just fine - her car is great and she's a little Transylvanian Dolly Parton - she's so innocent and naive sometimes - and sexy after all the time - plus, more than the touch of Mae West - the sets are well done the same, and the comic cast is great, with Edie McClurg at her usual best - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is cheerful. Whenever I have to do something to decide, I wonder how Elvira is biting potato chips - This movie is one that will be watched over and over - just for fun. Now I have to go on, Elvira's haunted hills, and see if he lives.
