I'm sitting in movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about the movies for hours. The admiration that this film has done to me is beyond my bounds because I look at the scenes of the film and look inside my thoughts for philosophical thoughts and dialogic innovations that might come out of something bigger than the mind of Damian Szifron. <br /> When I look at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I think; this man is brilliant. No wonder he created what is perhaps the best television show ever seen in Argentina, and then the first film full of elements that some directors have not yet achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name and awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> Beginning your journey from everyday life, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never in "El Bonaerense"; life of the Federal Police Department. Traper's film was a journey into the mind and experience of man, not to the places he saw. Yes, there was a lot of training and a lot of crime, but Szifron is "there," but it's a rather detective story like the ones we know and love with mystery and exciting music. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> But in his writing there is plenty of humanity and shows his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfred Días and Marian Silverstein. There are many great actors in the film, but these two actors are a movie that does not make the movie. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who just found his wife cheating; and must work on the case. The other is a psychiatrist who is assigned a detective treatment. He wants to meet him in regular meetings, but the sheriff uses time disposition and suggests joining Díaz in his routine: "It's nothing, usual things, no problem." But it is bigger than that, and they develop part of the personality of a doctor he did not know. The relationship that has arisen between these two ways can not be explained unless it is observed because it considers such a complexity that shows how talented are some men like Szifron who are trying to leave a signature today in our history. Achieving points of incredible spontaneity during a high pressure situation, Díaz tells Silverstein: "How do we continue to treat?" And Silverstein says, "No, I'm not your doctor, you call me for dinner, your friend": we're laughing because we can not do it. <br /> <br /> And we can not laugh when Díaz crashes a car in the street and it does not matter, all red lights on the street, or smokes the pots in his police patrol, and Silverstein can not believe it (but then she smokes her, because it is destroyed); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with Díazovi Raiders. The magic of Diego Peretti is what we get there. He himself, a psychiatrist, gives a performance in the "Locas de amor" plan, but it impresses for a whole range. Luis Luque, on the other hand, is back on track with a top-of-the-line image reminded of a great actor. <br /> <br /> There is a passion that I think, and as I said, I can write about the clock, but unfortunately this is not the way it works and I have to be accurate and summed up. Even though I have to watch a lot of old movies and study them, can I make sure that "Tiempo de valientes" is a comedy Argentina has been waiting for and never got? Until now.
