Tigerland watches the lives of a group of recently proposed men in the army who are called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this time, America knows they are fighting the loss of battle, and the director has us over a 16mm handmade documentary about the lives of several recruits at Tigerland camp in Louisiana. The film is rather a character study of no real conspiracy, but it focuses on the key character of Roland Boz, a neglected but intelligent man who just wants to escape from the camp. We are taken over by several characters in the unit and we wait for the story to unfold. I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and mainly about the army in general .. Great acting, and very memorable. Also, directors use movies and styles so well, because they look much like the old movie footage you always see in connection with Vietnam. It's great to see the film show that all fighting and problems were so important to the struggle with this battle. A special scene where Boz deviates from the training mission, where the instructor shows how to use the radio as a torture device, but summarizes everything about the war in a nutshell ... and it's futile. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film. Not just about Nam, but about who has to decide what is morally correct by being "in the army." Rating 9 out of 10.
