what a relief I find out that I do not realize this program! The taxpayer's summary is great. I also remember that I considered it scary and I had no family, I had to be 10/11 at the time I watched him. I think that for the girl who was part of the attraction, there was a very blond hair of lead and its permanently sad condition. The theme was played on the flute I remember - even though I do not remember how it went. I think the intro showed that he was playing - or maybe playing the flute on the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I'm destined to never know how it's over, or to see a clip or hear a melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
