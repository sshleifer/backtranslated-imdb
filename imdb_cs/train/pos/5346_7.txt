Carol, a young girl at the heart of the story, is moved to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the conflict of civil war in the late 1930s. For this girl everything is new, abroad. War and her father are her constant concern, while she has to plunge into a provincial culture that has been worth for years in New York. Imanol Uribe directs this film to numbers. Carol's family is clearly divorced, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is a pilot of the left-wing air force, the rest of the family is sympathetic to Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story adds nothing to what has been said much better, but it's an easy-to-follow movie. The outstanding landscape of northern Spain is displayed. Do not expect many events, because most of what's happening turns around Carol and the young boys he's spinning with. Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora, who left for America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who is involved with Carole. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left when she went to America. This actor, who usually has a major role to play in most Spanish films, has nothing to do with the enigma in the film.
