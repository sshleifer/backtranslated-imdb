This film came and went to theaters. Due to its nature, you can see why it was not well received. He was unfairly judged for his subject more than the film itself. Higher learning is not spectacular, but it was a good film that tried to talk about America's fabulous theme: racism. Plot / Story: Higher learning is mostly centered around Malika (played by Omar Epps) a naive track star who has to cope with not being a fast enough and strict professor (played by Laurence Fishburne). Fudge (Ice Cube), as well as the beautiful lady Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they will end up having to deal with some of the skinheads in the campus. Remy (starring Michael Rapaport) is a confused boy who ends up with a friend with some local skinheads in the campus. As soon as they look at him, they become as racist as they do. Opinion: Higher learning is not without its defects: Character development is rare, Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and skinhead leader (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes does not fit into this movie at all. In addition, women who dressed for homosexuals after being abused by men were clich√©s in front of this film, so you know that I do not like this movie part with Christy Swanson. Besides, this movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was as good as Professor Phipps (though I could have no accent), Fudge was the best performance Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was good as a confused Remy. Overall, it was one of John Singleton's best movies, and one of the reasons I'm looking at the garbage that's going to burn. The cinema needs more films, such as Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and fewer movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and a remarkable Shaft remake.
