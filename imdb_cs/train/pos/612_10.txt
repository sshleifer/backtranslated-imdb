This remarkable film can be summarized very easily. First, while comparison with the "Princess Bride" is inevitable, it is almost in vain. While both films combine an adult joke and humor with a fabulous backdrop, "Stardust" is so different from any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of genres, but its script and script are so unique that along with performances, special effects, cinematography and score - the end product is simply not everything that is comparable to what ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective when it draws us at the same time into the story and fantasy of the world in which it takes place, and pushes the story together, creating just the right amount of respect and excitement that is necessary to make magic a believer in the realm , there are signs. Thirdly, I did not find the movie that would be even hard to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots even made it even more convincing. He galloped out and played brilliantly overboard. This fantastic adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best I've ever seen since "The Return of the King" (not that I compare all the two). Ok so it's not that easy to summarize, but do not let any rough and / or heartless and cynical review or pathetic PR movie prevent you from taking part in the best time you could have in summer movies for a long time)!
