I disagree with anyone who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie when I was small and still doing it. It's sweet, fun and warming your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it did not have much story, it was still excellent, I'm giving it 10 and two inches up. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, it proves that your true wishes and dreams can be fulfilled. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally if someone says he sucks them before I say "Damn you." Because it was a wonderful little movie and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
