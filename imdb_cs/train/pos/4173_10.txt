A road movie in old-fashioned trains in the late Slow summer province. In the beginning, you will see someone wearing black trousers in lingerie and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases you will see that the trouser part is missing on the flag of sadness (apparently his father has died). On the train she meets a young lady and almost without words, but with many small gestures, begins a wonderful love story. It's some surrealism, a very poetic and a bit bizarre movie, with lots of special characters and special events. Beautiful photos with love for beautiful details.
