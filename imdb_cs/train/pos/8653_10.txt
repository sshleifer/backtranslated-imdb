I just watched California on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw her in July 2001. You think that with the recent wave of serial murder films, California would have been a lot of mention among some of the earlier films, but not. Perhaps if this movie was released sometime between 1996-1999, perhaps it could be more successful. In my opinion, "California" is a lot different from most of the serial murder films that were released in the late 1990s. It has a completely different atmosphere than most of today's serial killer movies such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies have shown a murderer, but this person is always a mask because we have never seen enough to really learn about them. "California" is a movie that really tries to break this barrier and really understand the criminals' mind. They try to answer questions like, "Why are they doing what they are doing because of something that has happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they because they like the excitement of killing?" are some of the things "California" is trying to answer, but it also leaves us room to try to solve things for ourselves. Brad Pitt gives an eternal impression like Early Gray. When we first meet at the beginning of the movie, we see that it is obviously a disrupted individual. When we see him for the first time, he's late at night. Soon he might be drunk. Then we saw him picking up the rock, throwing it out of the bridge, and landing on the windscreen of a passing car later. Pitt is wild in this movie. It's always good to see him playing psycho or really bad guys. It's funny that it would later cause it to play a real loop like in "12 monkeys" and that it would be at the other end of the spectrum in "Seven" David Fincher.
