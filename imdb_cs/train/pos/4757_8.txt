Rod Serling was, of course, a genius, and his gorgeous, playful, creative mind had left something of the period in which he lived, and television examples in this developmental state. There are no such shows now, but rather a "housewife" like Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful humorous and funny doubts that throw our high-tech screens. Jack Elam slipped into the episode with such precision and with his usual foolishness that I can not help, but I think Rod Serling adapted this show last week to Elama last week, even though he was a side story. This episode ends up like a twist, as usual, but shock and humor mingle with a particularly "Sergean" dexterity. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
