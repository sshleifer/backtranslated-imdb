As for Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think "Basic Instinct" and some maybe "Showgirls". But Verhoeven made his best erotic thriller two years ago: "De Vierde Man". This movie is charming and sad - and above all the story is quite likely, making the whole experience even more intense. The performances of Jeroen Krabbe, Ren√©e Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional and Verhoeven's leadership is doing the rest. "De Vierde Man" does even "Basic Instinct" look quite tame ... It can not be much better than that, the true classic of erotic nightmare. 10 out of 10, at least ...
