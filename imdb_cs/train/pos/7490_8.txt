Until today, I have never seen this movie. His film was shot on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village, where allegedly the giant bats suck the blood of the villagers. Honestly, it's a damn good movie that has a relaxed atmosphere Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play a character called Brettschnieder, which I am interested in because it was my grandparents. a carefully modulated film that has a tense and humorous lining that slowly builds up for its short run, just went crazy when it was about ten minutes before the end to realize they had a limited time to pack it all up. From this moment on, the end is a direct path to the goal with a very small barrier that preceded it. Leonard Maltin and IMDb report a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin may be wrong, and in this case, I think they are, since I believe more, say that the total run time is 67 minutes (Encyclopedia of Overlook films) To be aware of this I know is crazy, but because most prints available tend to run for about 60-63 minutes, the amount of missing material is considerably smaller if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it will not be so important because it is no more than five minutes and I doubt it will do or break the movie. What if I run the time if you like dirty old movies, do it all, watch this movie, its a great dark and stormy night movie.
