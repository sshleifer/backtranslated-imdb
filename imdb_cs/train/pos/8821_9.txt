The question is, can this fun movie really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I chose it at a 99 cents video store just for the name and the fact that Vestron Pictures was "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron has since been recognized as a mark of quality by the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We did not expect the movie to be full of prizes like the one that was. Your basic fence is as follows: Grange, this Goombian thug from planet Earth, poisoned the "Moonblood" and is sentenced to a criminal colony on a distant planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) and other minerals. The "Governor" of this colony and the mine owner use prisoners for work. Walker, a reward hunter (apparently one of only three on the planet), reminds prisoners that there is no leak because there is only one shuttle on the planet and they should deal with it. Then he is here without the name "Colonel," a reward hunting officer who suffers from a terrible recurring nightmare. Many of the film centers around the "futuristic" pursuit of cars (dunes with tiles covered with hips) with explosions abundantly. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other dusty positions of the Inland Reich. But what makes the film really shiny is a surprisingly amazing soundtrack with several LA punk bands from the mid-1980s. I really doubt that this soundtrack was sometimes vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying a movie just for the soundtrack. I can not even remember the names of the bands (shown in credits) except the Exploding White Mouse, because it was the only one I heard before I saw the movie, but I'm definitely watching it a movie. Essentially, the film is definitely not a waste of time, and you'd best enjoy 12 beer packs and some of your closest friends.
