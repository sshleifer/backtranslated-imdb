Spanish movies are in, if not Golden, definitely silver age. Pi√©dras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. Although feelings are strong or almost life or death, they are still not really melodramatic. That can happen. <br /> <br /> There are various stories that connect. One is a slowed girl who dares not go through the street to the next block. One is a middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another is about a girl with drug problems that leaves her lover. Yet another is about the madam of the brothel, who (almost) finds true love. It is definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain that filmmakers take women seriously.
