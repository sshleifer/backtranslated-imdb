Man oh oh man ... I foolishly deceived (it's not the right term, there's a long list!) So you can watch this movie and eventually have the opportunity to do so. And "news" is: Amazing labyrinthine spectacle! For every "supporter" Von Trier: both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the Dark, Five Barriers, etc. is probably the difference for its size from a visual point of view. Everything is beautifully dark and claustrophobic! You really feel like you're inside this "imaginary" spooky timeframe. If we take a surrealist cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, until the noir films of the 1940s with the avant-garde acid drops of Von Trier, he leads an art film scene as a "well-intentioned totalitarian" filmmaker of today. His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex questions without being irrational will hit the viewer's nerves with the intention of curing some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. As utopian, it seems I think people like Von Trier could help society in many ways on a wider scale. Daily movies and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer necessary as a reflection tool, perhaps this could be the beginning of a new era: "Age of emotional control over our fears." This is what constantly offers us through our work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
