I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw her series a few years ago !! This movie definitely shows her in her best light! The movie was so greatly packed and played! Every moment, a bit of fun is going down, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everybody really out alone! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, really made the film a reality! I also loved a bit where Mavis loses his wig and almost dies when he falls to the floor! This is the best movie!
