It's a very well filmed movie, carefully controlled, and with some outstanding character that is sometimes deeply moving - for example, a scene with a loyal but unseen policeman and his wife. The story is convincingly elaborated and exciting. The character of the gangster is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It is clear that the cops are just as brutal and ready as the underworld characters. Several modest reservations: I found the end slightly unilateral because it celebrates the successful integration of the hero into the structure by a police and judicial system that breaks down the ambiguity of the police characters that have been preserved to this point. I've also found the lead female figure somewhat weak: a bit more than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, everything that seems to be doing is crying and confusing the fighters fear.
