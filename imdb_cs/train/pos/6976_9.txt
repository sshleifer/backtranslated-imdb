I did not see BSG, I tried to watch her in the middle of the show, but I could not get it. I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday, I felt a little lost, so I decided today to look at the pilot and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think it's a promising show and the only side effect I have is that I want to watch BSG now. But what I really liked is that I did not have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what was going on in Caprice. From what I read on the net, they tried to reach out to the female population, because BSG had reached more men and at least in my case it worked. However, I suggest that if you are trying to watch the show and do it from the beginning of Pilot.
