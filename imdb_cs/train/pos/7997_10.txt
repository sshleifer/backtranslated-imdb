This is by far one of the better films and I did not disappoint. The soundtrack along with the finely shot handheld camera was great. There is always a chance that the film will not have the same faith, but I felt that the rhythm of this image and the timing were excellent. Dakota Fanning quickly becomes the basis of a movie that requires a child with an old soul personality and never disappointed me with her talent. As far as Mr Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken are concerned, they both overcome the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity who are trying to move to the light.
