What would you expect from a movie titled "Surviving Christmas" and presented as "festive entertainment", something like Ghandi or an English patient? There are a lot of things I love about this movie, it's fun, it is very well occupied and it is greatly written. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but it was doubtful when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. The film does not get that, because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly, one minute of an adult child, another mature man who realizes that he has gotten everything in life, except what he really wants. In fact, we see that Latham grows up in this film, when he encounters the problems of those who envy, and realizes that their lives are not so good; he sees that his own power is not so bad. <br /> <br /> The film has fewer moody or crazy scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is much harder than any other type of drama, it works or not, and very few comedic writers always fix it. I especially loved a dramatic scene where the family wanted to read parts written by Latham. We are delighted with the reaction of Tom Valca (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It is the dilemma of a greedy Tom Valca, who must bite his tongue, wear silly hats, or sing on a Christmas tree to win a win that keeps the film in motion well. <br /> <br /> Adding Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) to the story brings a wonderful romantic angle and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course, its bucket and thought-out; she is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and free and so inevitably her and Afflect eventually fall together in the snow and find themselves face to face. Great! One thing I would like to use was to use more festive music to enhance the atmosphere, but I really can not complain. I got what I wanted.
