After all the girls that Hollywood (and the Indians) have exploded, we finally have a movie that brings a few horrifying moments. There are some cliches while, but I'm not sure that it's possible to make a completely original film today. Not too new here ... it's just fine. <br /> <br /> Make sure and pay attention because "fine" fears come quickly and often. This is not the movie you will watch when you eat pizza. In this movie there is one very well written red herring and unfortunately one very badly occupied role. Cheri Christian simply does not make effective Julia (wife / mother). One thing is totally indecent. I know, I know ... she has just gone through a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows it because it's "normal" and the relationship between her and her husband is uncomfortable. I think the director wanted some sympathy for us, but I never did. Finally, the thumbs for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily be offset by the sound effect at the beginning of the end of the loan, but the director wisely resisted. It's not a masterpiece in any way, but it's a good, old-fashioned, scary movie ... something that is quite rare today.
