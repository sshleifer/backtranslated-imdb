Undoubtedly, the most horrible metal object made in manic heads of the eighties, which certainly does not sound as much as it thinks of how deeply many other contributions in this strange strange movie, such as "Hard Rock Zombies," "Blood Tracks," "Terror on tour ", and especially the ungodly Jon-Mikl Thor-Star wrath" Rock'n'Roll Nightmare "tended to be, and this side still deserves props to suppress excessive splashes and unnecessarily crazy special f / x blurring and glare in favor of focusing on adolescent high school figures that are portrayed with greater sharpness and credibility than the norm for teenagers in the mid-1980s, targeted the deadliest. Additionally, the film showed sardonic parodying both the stupidity of the surprised 80 degrees of heavy metal and the ugly self-righteousness of the deep conservative stiffness claiming it were the devil's music, they are (the famous Greed Decade heavy metal of the god Ozzy Oscarne has a cheerful piece like a crazy anketon TV evangelist!) <br /> <br /> Marc Price (hopelessly dweeby Skippy on "Family Ties") gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer, a wild, socially unpleasant and heavily hunted heavy metal fan who is constantly picked out of stuck fools who make up most of the student body at Lakeridge High School (the cruelty and badness of high school children is filled with a painfully credible accuracy). Eddie's life goes to the worse when his idol rock star Sammi Curr (an improbably exhausted painting by Tony Fields) dies in a hotel fire. Hip local jockey jockey Nuke (front man KISS Gene Simmons cool cameo) Eddie's hooks with Sammy is the final, unreleased album that when playing back, Curr's resurrection is a malevolent ghost back from the dead. He encourages Eddie himself to get to him with all the filthy mourners who make Eddie's poor life a proverbial living hell just to make Eddie calmer as the best fit. It's on Eddie who helps Lesley Graham's pretty girl, like Lisa Orgolini, to stop Sam before things get too out of hand. Ably directed with praiseworthy thinking and sensitivity, according to the actor Charles Martin Smith (who also appears briefly as a nerdy teacher), elegantly written by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson and Rhetto Topham, and able to act in uniform until sneaking, with a handful of " "The moments (a terrible attack on the back of a car with a grotesquely healing long tongue that features mutated things), the exciting succession of" Carrie "in the style of high school, the neat, used Halloween settings, revenge was rightly portrayed as a really ugly affair and a solid central message, that you should not make a certain exaggerated person of your hero strictly because of the calculated unlawful status that said this special condition.
