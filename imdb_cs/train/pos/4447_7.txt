Barbara Stanwyck gives this early soap, which is directed by Douglas Sirk, only the kick he needs. It's not nearly as memorable as Sirk's later melodrama, it's easy to see by looking at "Everything They Want," where Sirk is performing artistically in the next few years. Stanwyck is an actress who returns to her family in a small US neighborhood after leaving her ten years earlier. Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with a shocking return. Some of the cinematography is awesome and Stanwyck is hard nails and really gives this film a shot of energy. Overall, it's a pretty good show.
