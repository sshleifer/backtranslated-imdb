Seriously, can you imagine such a proliferation of talent in one film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their prizes, but O'Conor (like Young Christie) and McAnally would be perfectly justified: the clich√©s are true: they do not perform roles, they inhabit them. Day-Lewis is a "tour de force" - a transformation that is remarkable, but it was a true sign of the Academy's intelligence that they also appreciated Brenda Fricker's beautifully restrained, quiet and sincere work as Christie's mother. By the way, if you did not see this magnificent actress in the movie "Swann," it's another movie that's worth seeing her contribution (and the noble Miranda Richardson).
