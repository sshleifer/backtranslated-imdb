The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that could benefit from better acting and direction (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's achievements, it deserves the 10th Previous Poster called the Cheese Movie, however, I think it's a simple case not to see the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were obviously more interested in telling the story than to have a Hollywood shining feature film. And I praise you - the fact that it is not traditional, it also reflects the life of Whitman. This film is more documentary than acting. Being fascinated by such a story, when you rarely heard about these types of stories that shape today's mental health, it is the most important thing. I found this very nice view of history.
