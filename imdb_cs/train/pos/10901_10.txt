It is probably the best document I've seen for a long time. Jonny Kennedy has been and is still a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only did he survive one of the most painful diseases but he used his beauty to show the world that life is dead after death and never give up people and spread love. Watching minutes from his long combat effort was a heart annoying. Listening to his clever butt notes and seeing his cute gestures was heartwarming. And when he saw how he smiled, it was indescribable. I feel blessed that I could touch this little giant. If you ever have a chance to watch this movie - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
