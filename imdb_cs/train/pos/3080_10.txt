I complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it could be enough to bring this amazing show back to life! Just go to the official site and the rest is pretty simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and character. The whole concept is a breathtaking view! I am amazed that my favorite show ended in only one series. Why is it? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programs out there! Until I heard they were stopping by a friend, I did not even think it could happen.
