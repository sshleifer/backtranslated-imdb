This movie has several things. It's a "good feeling". Characters and actors are a pleasant, realistic and contemporary gentle performance. Most important, in my opinion, is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw baseball. Robert Redford looked good to throw and rock the bat in The Natural as well as Kevin Costner in For Love of the Game and Bull Durham. In the "Major League," Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked as if they knew what they were doing, but many of the others did not, and that picture was pure stupidity - and not very fun. So many older baseball movies, even where stories might be interesting, were such a lack of "Stratton's Story" and "Strategic Air Command" Jimmy Stewart looked as credible as a professional baseball player because your overweight, non-athletic Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Robal Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed the baseball capability that could be given in the late rounds when choosing to play a Sunday picnic (even if it was coed , even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The scenes of Quaid's high school team that he trained, those where he took part in his exams with Devils, and those who played with him in two smaller leagues and in the American League all ringed the truth. Participants are credible and capable. Besides, he is an interested actor who always delivers talented and proportionate characteristics (except for some of his "top" scenes and his compelling accent in his idea of ​​Jerry Lee Lewis). But he is definitely on the target, and this movie is "9," as good or better as anybody else in this genre, except "The Natural".
