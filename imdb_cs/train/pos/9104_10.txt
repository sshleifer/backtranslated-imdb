So I do not agree with other comments. Piedras is much better of them Magnolia or one of the other films that have been mentioned. Especially unrealistic attitudes, I think someone just wrote that it was just because he never lived in a Spanish society like me (and I'm not Spanish) is a very real film with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antoni San Juan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It's a movie about the continual constitution of man, we like or not we all make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
