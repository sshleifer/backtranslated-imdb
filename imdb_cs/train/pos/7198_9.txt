It's a really good film and the one I've enjoyed several times. Michael Caine is amazing as always. Michael Caine gained a reputation for having a role in any movie, no matter what the quality or lack of the same, but a good role in Sidney. From the beginning it's so well written. Who would think that Ira Levin, who wrote such scary things as Brazilian boys and Rosemary's child, could write something so humorous. Let's look at it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to disappear with such a good cast of director Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> I'm really reluctant to go about it, because if anyone did something about this movie, it would be a crime. Just look at it and adore it.
