It's good to see that Vintage Film Buff correctly categorized their excellent DVD release as "musical" because it's that film, clean and simple. Just like his unofficial remake, a murder at a windmill (1949), a murderous plot is only a pretext for a complicated girl show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading cast of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young , Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly, the most popular song of the movie is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with her "Sweet Marijauna", but also with her strong performance as a hero's girlfriend. As for the rest of the cast, we could do without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen completely. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak gag with the iconic icon of Toby Wing. In fact, I give you an idea of ​​the extent to which the rest of the comedy is over-devoted and excessively tense, super-stupid Inspector McLaglen simply can not put his hands on the murderer, even if you believe that in this case it is the person the most you think. Director Mitch Leisen is actually making a great effort to point out the murderer even to the silly member of the cinematographic audience by giving the player a close look after a detailed view.
