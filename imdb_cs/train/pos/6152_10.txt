Great, fantastic, probably the best Disney musical adventure. I have loved this film for more than 35 years because it is so imaginative, smart and entertaining. Even through stupid scenes of "flying beds," the other scenes and dialogue are magical and fun. Could they choose someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can not think of someone who would be more suitable for this role. Taking over this classic would be just as silly as the transformation of Mary Poppins. David Tomlinson, though he had few quality film roles, is absolutely shining in this adventure. He was a comic genius he often forgets today. Crazy, bad and right Englishman - no one really could make a ghost and pull him as elegantly as he did. It would be tragic to make this film again because Tomlinson had been deceased for several years and no one could enter the shoes and the justice of his character. Dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura on other movies with witches not capturing. I especially enjoy the parts where the Germans attack Eglantin's house and have to defend it in any way. <br /> <br /> Bobbing along, swinging to the bottom of the beautiful salt sea. Richard and Robert Sherman broke out of musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. A great movie he still holds today!
