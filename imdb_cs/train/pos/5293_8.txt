This is a very light comedy about an amazing family who has Pecker's son because he uses Pecka on his meal. Pecker likes to take all sorts of pictures of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, MD and he can get the attention of a group of photographers from New York. Pecker has a cute sister, who is simply about nuts over SUGAR and is actually ADDICT, removing a teaspoon of sugar from his bag. There are scenes of men showing lump in their jockey jerseys and girls doing almost the same. It's very hard to keep your mind from the channel with this movie, but who cares it, it's just a movie that will give you a few laughs in a simple picture of 1998.
