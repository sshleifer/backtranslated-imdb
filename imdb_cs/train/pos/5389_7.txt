Like the very primitive episode "General Hospital" located in the native department (and for difficult cases), this rapidly changing programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, as a disturbed young husband's main fence, is so noticeably a wreck so good reason. His expected wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward for 20 years in prison for being in a place where she is probably coming; Mrs. Young, as always, does nothing to leave her sympathy with the audience, and it's a bit too good to be true, though, of course, sympathetic and beautiful. Her difficult pregnancies and relationships with other girls in the department form the heart of the film, and the result - not entirely satisfied - feels good. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect actresses in the cinema," in the appropriate words of film historian David Thomson, radiates warmth and authority as a nurse and Glenda Farrell, as a careless new twin mother, receives the crown "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby . Frank McHugh appears in another subplot, and he gets to a larger extent than Warners usually allowed him to. It's modest and slow and Linden's expectation-dad panic stays with you all day long - such a part is often laughing but it's a terrifying young child in trouble and very convincing.
