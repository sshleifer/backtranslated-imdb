The best Stephen King movie next to IT, though this is more fun than creepy. <br /> <br /> This one has everything: <br /> <br /> - A great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and the funny portraits of the King himself <br /> <br /> - A long-awaited horror in a fun storyline ; <br /> <br /> - Great use of music, especially "Sleepwalk" by Santo and Johnny; <br /> <br /> -Adorable characters in a typical King environment: in the middle of the village anywhere; <br /> <br /> - A lot of humor. You can not really get scared because it's too fun and up; <br /> <br /> - But really nice makeup effects as they already do! <br /> <br /> And 4.5 ratings: I do not really get it. When was the last horror movie as fun as this movie?
