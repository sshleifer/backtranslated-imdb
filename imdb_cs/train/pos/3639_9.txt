This film, for me, is about a family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but for his family. I can not start telling you how to tell my little girl that Dad will go to Kansas City to cover the priests of Christ and Kansas City Chiefs. She should think it's the most beautiful thing Morris son did. Living dreams with family are what this is about. I think only a father who has close relationships with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
