Writer / director John Hughes included all the basic (as usual) with this hot sweet family film "Sunday afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet, premature orphan, since childhood cares for "Bill". Pairs live in wit when traveling to large American countries, A. Fate coincides with a "very handsome" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. Children will love this movie as they can relate to the heroine played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who has become "you go girl!" From Pepsi Advertising). The figure should be about 6 or 7, because it is necessary to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggest that she is 9 or older every day. Like "Home Alone," there are plenty of slap-sticks and small fists that make big fats. Again, it is the "form" of a movie that focuses on young audiences. Fun and hearty. Do not try to surprise yourself, but be prepared to throw a tear or two.
