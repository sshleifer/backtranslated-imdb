I tried to rent it on many occasions, but I always had a girlfriend who usually rejects burglary moves and comedy with commentary "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie." So she enters "The Almighty Solo Movie Night "! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome to Collinwood a rather nice movie. While quite unforgettable, it has moments of fun and a few laugh at the loud moments. I did not know it was a remake and generally looks at films that try to ignore this fact and watch them on their own. George Clooney introduces funny and short portraits as wheeled bush brushcutters that mostly left to think over two things ... 1. Would not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney gave a strange 5-minute opportunity? and 2. How do fake tatters that look old and faded and how easy they wash? Cast, all the great actors in their own right, have done a great job and you feel like they have worked together, which is quite important in a movie like this one. Needless to say that everything is not working as planned in this film, both in a paradoxical and humorous sense, but I did check out special features and consider tracking the original, so I think it's a success! Rent this time well, maybe catch some friends and pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On the side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear how much Paolo Conte has allowed me to leave scary scraps of scores for me after counting credits.
