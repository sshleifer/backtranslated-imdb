I grew up when the music in this movie was popular. What a great time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too small to go to service and night clubs. I guess it sounds like I've lived in the past (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong? World War 2 was a terrible time, with the exception of music. The death of Glenn Miller was terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was excellent; what voice! I do not know how I missed this movie. The main reason for this commentary is to attract the modern generation to an alternative to Rap and New Age, which is offensive to me. Watch this movie and give it a chance!
