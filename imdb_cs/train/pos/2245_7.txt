Salva and his friend Bigardo have been on the border for most of their lives. We see how foolish it is in cat meals where their playground gets gifts, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened little criminal, does not even have any redemption, until he discovers on television a reality that gives him an idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business will prove to be a winning combination, something Salva capitalizes on. He and Bigardo were in jail after a casual death of a priest who criticized the duo. Salva shows that it is natural for the reality show. It is transformed into a similar figure of Christ who is immediately successful in the program. Espe, who is the non-sense woman who is the producer of the show, can not escape the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Eventually, Salva is ultimately the victim of his own success. Jordi Molla, whose first director's work is this film, had some success in the way the film exhausts the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, saw its share of the bizarre, which the director felt as an attack on the observer and wanted to tell his story from the perspective of people who make wealth from naive audiences. <br /> <br /> Casting has taken several good moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, like any actor who chooses to direct his first film, would be more effective concentrating on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and others responded well to the new director.
