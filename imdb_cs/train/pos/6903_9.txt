This little prized film is one of my favorites. I can see it again and again. Dreyfus and Braga are champions, but Raul Julia steals the show! Gonez Addams, who is horribly humorous, with the right tone for this false suspicion of this often narrated story. Generally impersonal and unexpected, Moon Over Parador allows you to check your reality and connect to the entertainment that's going on on the screen. Two inches up!
