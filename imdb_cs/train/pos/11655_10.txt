There are too many subjects who avoid the cinema, and eating disorders are one of them. This movie shows it the way it is. It's not wild for viewers because it's seen with the real truth that makes it even stronger. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago, but I still remember everything and how I felt. It is a very strong film and it is a good support for anyone who suffers from eating disorders to gain the will to stop. That's what movies should be - they should be there to help people, not glamourise things that are wrong.
