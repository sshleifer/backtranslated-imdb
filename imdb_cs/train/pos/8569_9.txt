This is as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with its outrageous behavior and clothing, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more Cruella. This time we see her much more. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, a somewhat gloomy male leader. Using Paris as the culmination of the film was a clever idea. The film is worth watching any age if you love animals.
