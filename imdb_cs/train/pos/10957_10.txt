This show is unlikely to appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; does not require permission and does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, it is a spoiled, fanatical pervert. If you can not appreciate the unsurpassed humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. Composing Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehne (Comedy of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Steve Agee) and Creative Energy Rob Schraba and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also represents the best talents of the emerging online community, channel101.com. (If you're in this show, beware of the "Appropriate Media Division" on VH1 in March, it will draw on the same pool talent.) Check out the Sarah Silverman show. This kind of thing is a future of entertainment.
