King Solomon's mines bring Patrick Swayze (played by Allan Quatermain) who spent a lot of time in Africa, but he decided it was time to return to England and be the father of his son. He found that his wife's parents had taken care of his son, and that he had only a very small chance of getting a lot of money in court. Alison Deedy (played by Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa, and is being held by the African tribe for the ransom maps Elizabeth sent her. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are also some enemies (Russians) who want the map as well. <br /> <br /> The film keeps your attention to the end. Patrick once again plays a roughly honored man who comes to rescue a girl in need. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, a harsh quiet man, anger and strength; In the minds of King Solomon his character smiles several times. I really would like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed, living, loving story, in which he did not have to clamp his jaw and be so strong. Perhaps a little dancing helped. But it's a good movie for the whole family, and it's worth watching.
