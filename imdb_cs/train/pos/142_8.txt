The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish TV series is somewhat worse than the first, but it has a lot of laughter and fears. This time Udo Kier plays two parts, like an extraterrestrial child and his demoniac father. Another important part is Dr. Krogshoje, who has to face the terrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, and again Mrs. Drusse's patient will try to solve the mysteries of Miss Marple. After all, on the cliff and after the death of lead actors Ernst Hugo Järegard (Dr. Helmer) and Kirstein Rolffes (Mrs Drusse) you are wondering how they can do the third part, but I hope Von Trier gives it a shot. It is sad that Morten Rotne Leffers, a dishwasher of Down's syndrome # 2, also died shortly afterwards. Look at Stellana Skarsgård in your buddy. ***
