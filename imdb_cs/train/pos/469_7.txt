The story was somewhat interesting, but the characters were relatively flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts and behaviors. More extreme than necessary. I also think something went wrong in casting. John Turtorro really does not like me playing a semi-sax chess player, I'm not talking about an Italian player. The themes were not much described. <br /> <br />
