This video nods! Eddie is one of the most fun comedians I've ever seen. Not only does she have a class, she does some of the funniest observations of history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and intelligent comedian I've seen for a very long time. Tell all the other stands to step out of the stage and leave this "executive" government!
