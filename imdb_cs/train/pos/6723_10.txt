The equestrian rider is an amazing movie. This really shows how these people lived only for surfing then. Their lives were essentially surfing, living, breathing and having fun. It did not matter about money, work, girls, or things. For them were the waves of their girl. I've never been on a surf board and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense at all. It's a great movie and if you like surfing, you really should see this movie. If you're a surfboard and want to find out who started surfing, how he got into it, who's really famous or what, then you really should see him. It can be a document, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
