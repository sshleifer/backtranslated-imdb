I just wish the Return of the Jedi, was directed by someone else, I think there are too many ewoks scenes, totally useless. Besides, our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer says Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda just dies. But there are many extraordinary things to do this episode that I just can not hate it. Some SPOILERS 1 - Jabba Cottage 2 - Sail Barge Attack Sequence. 3 - Emperor (Now it's Evil) 4 - Speeders are chasing in the Endor Forest. 5 - The Last Battle. 6 - Scene of seduction on the dark side. 7 - Return Anakin to the good side of power. 8- And the last celebration. Some of them are so good they can bring tears to their eyes. If some scenes were truncated and another director was accepted, it would be as perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
