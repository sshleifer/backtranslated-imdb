Actually, I like the original and this film has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original voice cast has returned. Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's Ma. I know Simpson's bell rang, but the show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We see Simba as a "teenager". Downs: They lost it with a huge competition between Timon and Simbo. <br /> <br /> Ups: Rafiki told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." Downs: How did Pumbaa know about it? Ups: Script again. (some of the original songs there were, but it was just background music.) Downs: But stupid songs. (as well as Timon's solo.) Overall, it's a pretty good movie. I recommend this for fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, it's likely you will not like it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
