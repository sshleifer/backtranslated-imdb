Linking story: It's the first time for me, and it's one of Amicus's most popular anthologies - and it's easy to understand why, although I realize what a somewhat insignificant title might be for some film. I'm sure I chose director Peter Duffel - SMRTU AND MAIDEN (which is, by the way, the classic piece by Schubert, which is in the film during Peter Cushing's episode) - much more. Although the linking device itself is not so great, all the episodes are just as impressive and enjoyable. Production values ​​are indeed very good for the budget that Duffell had to work on. The second film fills the film with a great style that is not so common with this type of film, and sincerely, it regrets that it wanted to move away from the genre (though rather than being more of a type than feeling it underneath). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also ends with satisfactory DIABOLIQUE twists and presents a rather intense role for Denholma Elliott. That's all we really need from us. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks": For the second story, we introduced a curious romantic mood, which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two young female lovers who continue to possess them for so long, and whose friendly rivalry can only blindly and inexorably lead to the fate that is literally worse than death; the sinister hallucination with Peter Cushing is relatively well done with limited resources, and Ackland's unexplained inability - or reluctance - to leave the city somewhat resembles the house arrested by the aristocrats of Bunuel's EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962). > <br /> Sweets To The Sweet: This is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and is associated with understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee daughter). The film treatment of occult acting is both delicate and mature, culminating in a strong and extremely cool "curtain". Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as an adult in the picture that is part of the disc, and when I saw her, I felt immediately familiar with her face, but I could not get her finger. Later, when I read her filmography, it was revealed to me that she was playing in the long-term adaptation of "The Mousetrap" by Agatha Christie in the West End of London, which I had with my brother good luck, we were there on vacation in the summer of 2002! Needless to say, at that time, we had no idea that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrait in a very bad way, mainly due to her special appearance and the devilish smile! <br /> <br /> "Cloak": an embarrassing but oddly honest vampire story (which can still reveal many myths connected to a subspecies and invent some new) cinema and in one place Christopher Lee himself; Jon Pertwee is awesome as a camp horror star who gets more than he negotiated when he tries to bring his work to authenticity; Ingrid Pitt sends her picture nicely, although her role is somewhat minor in the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has an unforgettable piece; the style of the "end of the silent film" was pretty daring to attract the audience, I think - and while some of the humor sets off as a heavy warrior "THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS" (1967) or THEATER OF BLOOD (1973), it is also more infectious and definitely ends movie on high (and very unusual) note! <br /> <br /> The quality of video and audio is quite satisfactory, since I do not have a different version to compare it; The main culprit is some noticeable damage to the press, but it is never so unpleasant to influence one's enjoyment of the film. As for the bonuses, starting with the audio commentary: frankly, this is one of the best chats about the genre film that I remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby will get his opinion more than usual for the moderator, but his efforts will surely allow director Peter Duffell to touch on all aspects of production (while in some of the other films you've been expecting more to be there!), And as such, it's very nice a track that complements the main features very nicely. Featurette "A Horror Movie" is a valuable effort with Peter Duffel again in the center, but this time with contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and star Chloe Franks Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get movie notes, reviews, bios, and a gallery of posters / still pictures that are once again gloriously gathered (with recent reviews that are something new - and welcome).
