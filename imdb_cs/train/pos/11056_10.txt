Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up with this "The Baron," a fantastic series of three superhuman spies who prefetched "The Six Million Dollar Man." It was my favorite when I was a young man, and I liked to notice it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had unmistakable chemistry on the screen like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while kindly Alexandra Basted released her role as Sharron Macready. Late Anthony Nicholls made the incredibly cruel Tremayne. The best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "interrogation" was favorably compared to "Prisoner". I regret that it was never the second series; the concept had so much life in it. Craig and Richard were competitors for Sharron's affection? What if Tremayne learned about the power of the champions? Did masters have other abilities than those we have seen? We have never found it, unfortunately.
