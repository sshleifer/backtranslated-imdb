Creators of tweed types thought they had solved it all. Today's people living in Polynesia come from migrant Asians moving from the Far East, Island to the Island, east to Tahiti and other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific Ocean for thousands of years. But steadfast thinking simply did not fit with the young Norwegian ethnographer Thorem Heyerdahl. If this explanation was true, how do some people who were born and behaved on these islands have traditions, works of art, and physical features reminiscent of those in Asia but South America? How can the vegetation in Ecuador, Peru and Chile look the same as what you find on the island several thousand miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point to the sea to South America and say where their ancestors, led by Tikim, their equivalent Adam, come from? Meanwhile, as the Norwegians say, the Scandanavian predecessors who have been persecuted from the South American continent colonized and, together with some of the indigenous peoples they shared with them, sailed across the sea - they headed westward? It's too much for Heyerdahl's coincidence. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crew and local know-how for traditional rafting, expeditions begin. It is also a trip to human imagination, for it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the basics of instruments and the navy. Oscar winning documentary may be dated by its tone and anglo-ethnocentric approach, but with the spirit of adventure, even a space program that has begun ten years later is being promoted because men are willing to risk everything to test the theory that they think is true. Great. Do a favor and first read the book. It's an amazing strings and a perfect setting for a news-style movie.
