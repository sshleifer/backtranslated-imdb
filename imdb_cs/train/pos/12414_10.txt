The first American film, Renny Harlin, was one of the most successful film horror films (like "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Twenty years before, Lane Smith had executed the convict improperly. Now he is the director of the newly opened prison, and the male spirit is back for bloody vengeance. This atmospheric and highly humorous film features lots of haunted gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are a fun massacre.
