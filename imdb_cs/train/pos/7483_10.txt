Vanilla Sky is a remake of 1997 Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And, in my opinion, much more human and emotional versions. Tom Cruise plays David Aamese, a selfish ego-man who considers other people's emotions to be self-evident and thinks of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David the best and in many ways just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies David's birthday. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David, a casual friend. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, psychologist David. All of their interactions and their implications make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will no longer explain the conspiracy, because it is much more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all people who call this movie, too confusing to watch them. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but it is not confusing. And, in my opinion, one of the best movies he ever did.
