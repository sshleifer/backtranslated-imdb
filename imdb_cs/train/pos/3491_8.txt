Cast is great, it plays well, the plot is interesting, the development is full of tension ... but it's hard to drown all those elements into a movie that is barely 80 minutes long. If more time was spent plotting plot and subplot, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of stuff would make it a very good film, rather good.
