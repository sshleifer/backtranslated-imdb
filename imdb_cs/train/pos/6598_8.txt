I saw this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. It was difficult for me to really understand Brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences. Seeing this film in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something from the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it is sometimes a bit more dramatic. And that's the only negative comment I have on this movie. Sometimes there is too much, too much sex, too many murders and too cynicism for one movie. The director could shoot some things a little finer, which would make the movie more effective. Still, I liked the film and the way the story breaks down. Characters are complex and very similar to people in real life. Not quite pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who can be both ugly and beautiful. This makes the film realistic, though the story is not so convincing.
