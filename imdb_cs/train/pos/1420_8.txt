To celebrate Earth Day Disney released the film "Earth". If we stop far from any sober message of misery and destruction, we treat some of the excellent animal recordings in their habitats without feeling too bad. <br /> <br /> The show stars are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and her body. The narrative begins at the North Pole and continues south until we reach the tropics, all with the introduction of the inhabitants of the various climatic zones that are passing through. Global warming is mentioned as we see the polar bear walking; in recent years it has been pointing to the shrinking sea islands. We never see that the bears catch a seal, but the father's desperate search for food leads to a dangerous solution. A Caribbean airplane shootings after the tundra are one of the most spectacular wildlife shots I've ever seen; it and other migrating wild birds just reward the price of the admission to see them on the big screen. One of the disappointments that I felt was that they were otherwise filmed with amazing shots of great white sharks, a slow motion. You never feel the characteristics of wild animals; at their incredible speed. The idea that the movie slows down to hear a great deal, I think it started (or at least it's the first time I remember seeing) the Kung Fu TV show in the early seventies. that, as the credits roll out at the end, some demonstrations of used cinematographic techniques are revealed. This film has enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments to make it a convenient choice for nature lovers. Maybe due to some selective adjustment (which saved us from the terrible end of the predator-predator moment) and the fact that this record was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it's a solid movie in itself. And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
