This pleasant little noir boasts top-notch occupations and many memorable scenes. Great distraction is a total ignorance of authentic accents. Spanish characters in the film are French (Boyer), Belgian (Francen), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungarian (Lorre)! And to begin with everything that is Bacall is to be the English aristocrat! In spite of these absurdities, the performances are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speak wildly with different accents is a real sponge! And I think when they see how they are, they really should speak in Spanish! It seems strange to me that the Warner Brothers in Los Angeles could not find spanish-speaking actors! Of course, Hollywood often has a policy of "making an old accent" - another favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch) who falls in love with a Russian Mexican soldier (Ramon Novarra). Perhaps they should get Novarro as a "confidential agent" - he would be great in Boyer's role or at least in Francen (which would greatly save the dark make-up budget).
