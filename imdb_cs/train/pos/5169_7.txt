I've seen the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999 one night when I went to the canal before bedtime and I really enjoyed what I saw. Since then, I have been alert, told TV listings, rolled DVD / VHS shelves in stores, but recently found a copy when I found out that some internet shops sold it. Then I was procrastinator of the world level, but I still did not drive it. Finally, I found a copy of the City Circle while visiting Portland a few weeks ago. It took me about a month after I returned home before I sat down and watched it. So what do I think about the movie? It's good. It's not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth the $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, she rated it as 7/10, with the potential to become 8/10. Then I will have to sleep less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid overturning to do some dialogue.
