I was watching the DVD of this movie, which also comes with an excellent track of comments (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (the subtitles in English say that the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia), a very violent evil man raises boys to be the killers by starvation and trains them to fight and kill. Sends Pang to kill some people in China, and a cop is killed during the killing. Police officer Wai is a free cannon who worries about his father, who is also a policeman who was shot and in a coma. Wai's chief is his father's friend and worries Wai's false behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug dealers, shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and is hiding in a shabby dump where he meets a woman who comes here to find her mother and repeats that her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but she rescues her from her father who seems to have her is giving birth to sex, maybe that's the reason for Cat III). Wai becomes increasingly obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals the boat and takes the woman to her home where they are married and she gets pregnant, Wai follows and joins the evil man (who is training the boy) who has signed a contract of struggle and training to get Pang . Between Wai and Pang, a major conflict with a heavily abused woman is the main victim, and Wai dead, and Pang cuts his child from a dead mother only to die and leaves him as a possible other boy to be picked up as a killer. This movie is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. A woman with long nails pulled out of her leg. Neck and torso knives. The weapons fired directly on the head. And some very intense whips. Maybe it's grim and intense, but it's definitely worth seeing.
