Those who say that this film deserves something under the unspeakable grace she shows will disagree. It's an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I ask you to consider the fact that a document was shot. The courage that took the film is the most remarkable. We found out that the two brothers are divided when it happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing their own and safety. Assessing whether it is smarter to shoot a video of the tragedy or save lives as amazing, amazing firefighters, is not my answer. I just know that in thirty years, the class full of children will not know the other. <br /> <br /> I present my whole heart to 10. So the art of shooting was created! Capture the natural emotions that real life offers. You can keep kung-fu junk mail. Romance is cute. Action never reaches this level. This film, 9/11, will be timeless in that it celebrates itself. She did not have a glancing look. She did not have all the obvious vanities that the lion's share of many movies is on many screens. She had class, calm, nature, and had a record of a day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. She talked about things that are inevitable for the camera. Please note this movie, as it claims, exciting tributes to all those who have fallen for America's free beautiful name. How can you put something less of a movie that shows, does not decorate the natural bravery of real people working in unreal times. I love "The Godfather," but "9/11" is forever another kind of film because it is now another kind of world. It is an art without questions or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
