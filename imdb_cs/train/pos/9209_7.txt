STAR EVALUATION: ***** The job **** simply lacks a *** mark that a small bit between ** Staying behind * Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is doing his bitterly in the Wild West when he sees a group of men who have a bad deal with the lady. Being a gentleman, he naturally enters and stops it, killing the son of a nasty enforcer. That's just the beginning of all the combat weapons that only one winner is waiting for. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star that never really did. Maybe I discovered it too late and after the second movie I saw last Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something for the westerns, these are movies that take me to another time and place and provide real fun, making Dudikoff choosing one of his better scripts as well as his films. <br /> <The film captures a few points in the form of naff central villain, sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some general ropey acting from some cast, along with mandatory cheap looking files. But if your life was, for some special reason, dependent on watching Dudikoff, it would be one of the best options. ***
