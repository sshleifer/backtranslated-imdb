Gosha is the last great movie of the 1960s. A determined stylist with a great sense for his films, Gosha has teamed up with Shintara Katsu (Zatoichi glory) to make this difficult indictment of homeless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tench" (the heavenly verdict) is a word that loyalists call to the Emperor to murder enemies or "traitors" to the cause. Katsu plays his character "a simple sentient devotion to a manipulative politician in the name of patriotic pride." Anyone questioning the politician is labeled "traitor" and becomes the target of assassination One of the best filming of the film at all, many shots is an incredible composition of form, color and light The battle scenes are common and very bloody and brutal.Blood becomes a part of the colorful palette used by Gosha for his pictures.Gorgeous and disturbing.While the personal story is simple, the historical background is complex and while the basic lessons of history for this time in Japan would it has been very useful, you can easily fight the film.Many disadvantages for the movie are the music track, length and Katsu occasional cheerleading scenery.It has a drunken scene that is over the top of the film but in reality a very accurate view of the drunk. > Mistakes, but one of the big chambara movies.
