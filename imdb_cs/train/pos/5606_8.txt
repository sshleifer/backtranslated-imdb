It's a very hard movie and it's almost impossible to handle what's going on. At first, it looks like a walk-in movie about a guy (Trelkovskemu) who needs a flat and rather moves towards him when the current tenant (woman) commits suicide. Then the speed and speed begin. Are neighbors trying to kill him? And why does a dead tenant's clothes appear in an apartment? One is finally wondering if Trelkovskij is a former tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski attracts to us is to lie to us. We suppose that when we see things from the point of view of the character we see in the matter as a figure, and that there may be a distortion of reality. We assume that the camera is showing us from an all-knowing point of view things that we see reality - but Polanski has a camera of lies.
