The film is divided from the beginning, it seems that Eddie brings this uniqueness to the stage and makes it the most basic thing that is funny when she as a girl succeeds in making the old family tradition. The film is very rare in this country, but it is not guaranteed to be available in other countries, for which I have searched many websites and still have no luck, calling companies searching for precious videos, and yearly waiting lists. SO SLAVES ARE VERY WINNERS. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and he sees that the video gets it, it is worth the money and can not be far enough wrong.
