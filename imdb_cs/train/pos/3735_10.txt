It really touches the story of a recruiting camp in America where young men are ready for a Vietnam war. I have always liked a human study when it comes to war films because it translates personal, subjective views on war, against action war films, where actions and technical data are analyzed on the premise of human factor. <br /> <br /> The film succeeded in placing a new rotation on an old-fashioned subject and was able to move away from the usual war films, especially by focusing on anti-heroes from a traditional standpoint. The film focuses on the tragic nature of Bozza, who cleverly avoids being hit by a dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control of his destiny and to fight for something he does not believe in, spending his energy in finding ways to avoid being sent overseas , both for himself and for the comrades, and ends up ironically when he finds his own just reason why the war will end up. Perfect irony. The effects are truly exceptional, and the making of a documentary almost makes you feel transformed into a movie. The film also offers the idea for those who are excited about action in the usual war movies or war-lovers, and hopefully they awaken some ideas of the generation that fortunately fled the terror that it was designed to.
