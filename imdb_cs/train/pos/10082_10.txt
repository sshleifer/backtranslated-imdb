The film is really dizzy, unique and uplifting. The story is universal in that it is a battle between good, evil and the world between. The most important thing is that his rating is bad, misleading and annoying. Blockbuster has a rating as if it were a movie rated X. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles.
