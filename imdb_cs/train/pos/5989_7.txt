The film begins with a group of children in a reform school and focuses on a child called "Gabe," who apparently worked hard to obtain his conditional rights. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to start again and soon Gabe meets Dead End Kids. The kids in this movie are small punks, but they are much less antisocial than they in other previous films and deep in the depths, they are good punk judgments. However, there are also some criminals who commit insurance frauds in the arson and see Gabe as a suitable sacrificial ram - after all, he was reforming the school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed. So, when Gabe is ready to be sent back to the "Big House", she's on the rest of the gang to save him and expose him to real cheaters. in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s, and films were generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the end of the boy's contract, they went to the Monograma studio and the films, charismatic, were very weak and formal - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being almost a show, and the band was renamed The Bowery Boys. Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had excellent writing and production value, and Hall and Gorcey continued to pamper for the camera, it's a pretty good movie - and almost earns a score of 7 (it's really close). In fact, while it's not a great movie aesthetically, it's sure to be a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it 7! Sure, it was tad hokey - especially to the end when kids take the law into their hands, and Reagan ignores the law of rights - but it was also quite fun. Dead End Kids are doing their best, and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still fun and somewhat charming - so if you can break the distrust, it works well.
