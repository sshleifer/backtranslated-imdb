A typical De Palma film from many styles and scenes that will bring you to the edge of your seat. Sure, what makes this movie better than the average thriller is style. It has some greatly modified scenes and some scenes that are really nervous wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is from the movie; Museum scene and elevator murder. There is some mild erotic scene and the film pace may not be fast enough to allow this occasional viewer to fully appreciate this film. So this movie may not be good for everyone. The story itself is also pretty good, but in reality it's the style that makes the movie work! It could be just for fans, but occasional viewers should appreciate the well-being of the film. <br /> <br /> There is a nice character portrayed by good occupation. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice, and Angie Dickinson acts as well as he looks (it's not bad for a 49-year-old!). Musical score Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma likes and fits the film very well, as well as his score for another De Palma film, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerve bourgeois thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br />
