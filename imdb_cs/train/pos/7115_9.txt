A fabulous and ruined war film that focuses on the inner suffering of the blind sailor Al Schmid. Though it's hard and unpleasant, it's ultimately heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was excellent. But bones I can choose. Regardless of how many .50 balls I burned, I have never seen any water or dirt that would be hit! It hurt realism, but I can live with it. Excellent performance by Eleanor Parker, again as his girlfriend.
