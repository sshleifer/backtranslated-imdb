Jeopardy feels like it's a popular movie - one of the movies that has run out of studio between big budgets / boxing. It's just 70 minutes and does not have many sets and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what star of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is once again a heavy lady when she runs into the escape of the convicted while seeking help for her imprisoned husband in the Mexican desert. Most of the film focuses on how she deals with her prisoner, who wants to get him in exchange for his help. Some psychological struggles there. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length is tense and Stanwyck is great, it should go without mention (but I still praise it).
