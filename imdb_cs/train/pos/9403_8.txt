"Man in a White Suit" is another feather in the cap of expert Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Sweet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and Lavender Hill Mob). Guinness brings the usual class into the movie and makes it far more than just a typical comedy. In fact, the comedy is not quite obvious. At the end of the picture, the drama almost became complete. It's a kind of studio comedy Ealing that counts for not laughing but a general entertainment experience like the best British comedy of that time. The whole idea of ​​a suit is not very original, but the way it is done is. The film is very original and recommends all fans of the comedy Guinness or Brits. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
