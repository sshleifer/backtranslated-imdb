Enjoyable adventures from director George Stevens (before turning to a more serious fare, such as RAMEMBER MAMA from 1948 and GIANT in 1956) that sets the standard for all future events. Freely based on Rudyard Kipling's poem, GUNGA DIN follows the path of three military officers in India from the 19th century. The noble trio must carry out a series of battles and other various dangers, including the cult of the thuggee and the temple of gold. Their adventures on the screen remain thrilling for over six decades and have inspired almost everything from STAR WARS (1977) inspired cliffhanger to similarly rendered RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The biggest reason for the success of this film is the perfect performance of the film trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen is seldom better when he's a tough guy, Cary Grant is the most popular comic strip, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, is just as fascinating as he can imagine - maybe even more than his rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not improve, and such a warm and believable co-ordinate is exactly what is lacking in the most modern action pictures - and it receives immense support from the amazing Sam Jaffe, which overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title the lighthouse character of humane sweets and silent powers. A huge hit in his time (the film was supposedly the second biggest producer of money in 1939 for the extremely successful GONE WITH THE WIND) and remains probably the best film of its kind.
