A huge, exhausting and passionate summary of American cinematography that we see through the eyes of Martin Scorces. Needless to say, there is never a boring moment in all 4 hours running. Many genres, periods, and directors are explored, discussed more from a cinematic perspective than a contemporary director. For anyone who is even remotely interested in American films or cinema in general. Masterpiece and Best of BFI Century of Cinema. <br /> <br />
