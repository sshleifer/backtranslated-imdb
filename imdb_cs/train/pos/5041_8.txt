Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious person waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer persecuted by the FBI. When Agent Doyle comes to the office, he tells him that the serial killer is really his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood. It was a simple three-member family: his widow Dame Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One evening the father collects two brothers and tells them that the angel of God has just visited him and promised his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie four months ago on VHS and I was watching again yesterday, now on DVD. Although it is a low budget movie, the script is sharp, error free. The cast is excellent, but I would like to emphasize the performance of Matt O'Leary as a young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror. Great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this film: "A Mão do Diabo" (The Devil's Hand). If it were at least "God's hand," it could be acceptable. But calling this movie as "devil's hand" is really ridiculous. Brent Hanley, a screenwriter, did not deserve such a lack of respect from a Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("Devil's Hand")
