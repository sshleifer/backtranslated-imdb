What a fun movie experience! I was expecting it to be a children's film, and I learned that I enjoyed more than my teens. Take the fabric, it's not sad, just "moving" in parts. Finally, it's a "good feeling" for the whole family. Note: It's 2 hours, so you think you're leaving the smallest "squirmers". AP
