After repeatedly listening to a CD sound I knew I wanted this movie, got it on Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can not describe it. That's how I heard about him, but she did not understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this shots. It was incredible. Wembley concert clips are scattered by surrealistic sketches, such as nannies born in a garden party, while Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning song titles). George Claydon, a small photographer from the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a chauffeur jumping out of the car and one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it, even though I have interpreted the compensation spoilers for this review, so you just need to see it. Avoid description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious about the fact that Ringo was driving a rock document - it was 35 years ago - now I finally found that it's on DVD for 2 years but it's finally in my house. It's an amazing viewing experience - even fascinating. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD comes with hidden add-ons and copy and paste from another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden add-ons to DVD Born To boogie double. <br /> <br /> 1. In the disc menu 1, select the bonus material and get extra scenes 2. On the extra scene page, Scene 42 has 1 and hold down to the left 3. When the cursor disappears, hold down until the " Star + 1972 "4. Press Enter <br /> 5. From the main menu on the second disc, select the sound options 6. On the sound options page you will get to the 90/25 card (I think it's right) and hold down the left button 7. When the cursor disappears, hold down the right button until the "Star + Home Video" logo appears 8. Press Enter
