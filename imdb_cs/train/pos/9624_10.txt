The movie I thought was great was about romance with some tension between them. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor, I do not know why people still give him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris, she is a great actress, and for those who think she looks too old for Robe, it's only five years. Rob had a leading role in his TV series, as well as one on the Scifi Channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. He also starred in a number of television films and is now making the TV series Mini. <br /> <br /> They have to give him more leadership roles, which is best.
