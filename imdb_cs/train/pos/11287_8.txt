As other reviewers report, it is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the film, because it seems to me to be a fairly accurate representation of what was to be a trading place. Besides, exposure is necessary, so we know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and frightening sequences of persecution ever made. This happens when a safari group of Harry has to overcome a cannibal tribe. Production figures ahead of the census bring a lot of realism, which really depict the terrible dangers that the Europeans expected to go into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps before, a precise description of how scary healing indigenous Africans were with their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two cheetas! Do not miss the classic of adventure.
