When I heard Patrick Swayze finally returned to his acting career with KING SOLOMON, I was very excited. I was expecting a great action adventure like Indiana Jones. What I got was 4 hours long (with ads), which was very slow. The second and third hour could be omitted altogether, and the story would not suffer for her. The end was good (no spoilers here) but I still kept more. But all you can do is prey that Swayze is doing "RoadHouse 2" so he can return to the action genre that made him famous. Until your fan is down to King Solomon, read the book or look at the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but her only hour and forty minutes of life left instead of 4 hours.
