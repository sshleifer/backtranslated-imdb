I was looking at it when my wife called to ask the other room as to my fare selection. My comment? "I'm watching my life!" Although I'm younger, but only about 5 years old than "Rocket Boys," I remember the absolute urgency Sputnick welcomed our education administrators and how the whole science fair gained momentum and took me and others into a competing storm. My own tornado brought me to a scientific fair in my own state, in physics until 1962, though our group was less successful in gaining support for firefighters, for example, we turned to counseling and counseling to tragic events, our city was so that will allow us to check out the Nike rocket on the shore of Chicago. This movie brought me all the hobbies and I bet that it all brought us a lot of us "UberNerds" in the late fifties and early 60s. We are in a similar period of scientific brain drainage and we really need this film as a country. See it!
