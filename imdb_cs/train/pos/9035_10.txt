The game in this movie was great. As an amateur rocketeer I found very few mistakes. As a human being touched my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you think they are real characters. Laura Dern, a popular actress, missed nothing from her performance. Young actors who play Rocket Boys have shown talent over their years, especially the young Homer. Homer's father inspired the eternal relationship of love and hatred between father and son to make him feel real. If you do not get a lumps in your throat or do not move when the first successful rocket rises or when your father and son come to the habit, then let yourself check your pulse (you can be dead).
