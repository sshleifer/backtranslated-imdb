The film looked like a pass for "Immoral Study". Most likely, I was never too interested in the burning need of an artist to immortalize the male act and thus the whole stirring of "Now who drew this penis?" it sounded a bit unreasonable. The dialogues in this movie are somewhat terrible, although visually this movie has gained momentum. I almost dug up when Tassi entered the painting of a mental picture, but then the film went back to the penis. We highly recommend it to those who have not seen it.
