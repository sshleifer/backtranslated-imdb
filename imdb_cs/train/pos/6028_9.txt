This is the middle-season film Antonioni, which most critics quickly dismiss as a "faulty" view of American youth culture / politics. For what it is worth, it was better and more memorable than its more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotions and empathy than anywhere else. The story is simple, but serves as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observation and criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counterculture, and all the unlawful, anti-war resistance that was so prominent. <br /> <br /> And, from a purely technical point of view, it's a remarkably created film; ranging from the initial order of credits to the bizarre love-in desert, to the use of billboards, up to the fore-fall, a cathartic finale that used 17 camera settings (in its own way, as strong as the peak of a wild bunch). Antonioni also chose one hell-haired girl with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful movies ever to be loved. This is not much about "acting," because it feels like documentary drama, and so the use of non-professional as a lead couple works very effectively in this context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with wonderful music, but its use is impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the movie, mostly because of the choice of music - from Pink Floyd - that's so beautiful visuals). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In contrast to popular opinion, it is cinematic success and one would be excited to anyone who has a taste or tolerance for off-beat. It's worth it to look for, and one of those 60s core movies that require DVD / release restoration.
