Another small part of the enormous puzzler's Holocaust image turned in the face of the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, an event I did not know that started at the end of February 1943. Details are given in the appendix that follows This review. The film story sets the story of this protest in another, contemporary story that begins in New York today. Here is a well-looking Jewish woman whose husband has just died and shakes her children and others by insisting on an enormously orthodox sad ritual. She goes even further, asking her daughter to be a non-Jewish fiance to leave the house. An overwhelming daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) is then taught for the first time by her older cousin that she was admitted and protected by Aryan woman during World War II in Berlin, her mother, eight years old. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and finds Lena Fischer's wife, now 90 years old. Hannah easily convinces a woman to tell her story. Everything seems to be a bit more. The film is further enhanced and focuses on long-lasting shows, especially the events of 1943 surrounding a protest in which the fictitious central figure is the same Mrs. Fischer on 33 (played exquisitely by Katja Riemann), baroness and perfect pianist who is married to Fabian Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men who was detained at the site of Rosenstrasse. Narrative briefly weave back to the present and end again in New York. While scenes in the presence of saturated colors, scenes from 1943 are emptied, strong in blue-gray tones. The quality of acting is generally quite good to expect due to the deep talent reservoir in Germany and in the direction of Margarethe von Trotty, the most prominent female filmmakers of the new German cinema, former actresses. The story of the protest is simply said. Only one function was missing, which would help: notes at the end of the text showing the final result for those people who were taken into custody at Rosenstrasse, a result that was incredibly positive, as stated in the appendix below. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Too long, unnecessarily layered, supplier of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so go with ordinary raps. It's too long. But in this film, I discovered an austere, powerful, spontaneous, and utterly convincing voice of protest from women who held waking off Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I did not find a devastating, current or manipulative image in this view. The very absence of extreme violence (no one shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension, which has gradually increased. You expect some vicious attack to begin. The weakness of the film stayed with me later. I often woke up late at night when I saw the movie, my mind was full of bleak, melancholic, chaotic images and film-inspired feelings. This is rare for me. (In German and English). My Rating: 8/10 (B +). (Viewing 31/05/05).

The Jews had German relatives, many of which were very interconnected, Adolf Eichmann hoped that separating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their relatives were sent to labor camps and not to more ominous destinations in the occupied Poland. <br /> <br /> Normally, detention was detained only two days before being loaded into trains heading east. But before the deportation of prisoners, wives, and other relatives came in, the winds of what was happening appeared at Rosenstrasse, first in one and two, and then in ever-increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> It may have been up to six thousand, though not all, at the protest. Women demanded back their husbands every day for a week. Unarmed, unorganized, and without leaders are struggling with the most powerful forces available to the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels, a gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, desiring the racial teachings of this city, was also entrusted with the public morality of the nation. In both cases, she was afraid of the possible consequences of female acts. Rather than inviting more open opposition by shooting women on the streets and fearing that they are threatening the secret of the "final solution", Goebbels and Hitler's competition have released Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who have already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> Hitler and Goebbels were the only decision to postpone the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost all those who were released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women gained an amazing victory over the forces of destruction.
