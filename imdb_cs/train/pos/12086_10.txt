An amazing family drama / comedy with MacClaine and Garr who entertains and heats the heart every time I see her. We strongly recommend to all ages from 9 to grandmothers. A beautiful piece from 1962. The story includes the difficult Garr, her two children, and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) who tries to accomplish her goals without being a head of the family. The "Family" heads west to take the legacy of a long forgotten relative, who left Garra descent, a Cavalier caf√© from the late 1940s. Sober Garr, like a sweet but determined mom, brings the whole family to the restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is an old circus artist with card tricks, magic pills and a jester sense of humor ...... loves to make children and her children into silly and sometimes dangerous games ... ..A what happens next is the wonderful combination of the Miracle Lords, which was worthy of the Cuban rocket crises (with authentic television news from a real event) and a "funny" joke that was completely lost. This film engages, philosophizes, casts doubt on the religiosity and irritating view of the terrible fear of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Ultimately, one remains with the astonishment of faith, family, and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music of the 1960s is great! <br /> <br /> We recommend STRANGLY as a good feeling FILM 10 out 10
