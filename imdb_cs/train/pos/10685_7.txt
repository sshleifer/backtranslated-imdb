This film has a clear story that is totally unusual for a musical genre. Cats, Phantom of Opera, and other Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals can be considered metaphorical because they use literary works as their framework. The story of "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the very core of human relations, especially Indonesian people. Despite the fact that the film was based on a "supposedly" fairy tale, it is actually a "child" fantasy in Indonesian adults. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how the Indonesians express themselves. I think the choreographer should explore the Indonesian way of dancing by not worrying about the fact that Indonesian dance development tends to be more Westernized. Dance sequences appear embarrassing in some respects and are not sync with songs and / or music. Yet I still like this movie and I consider it a new wave of Indonesian film genre that I hope to improve in the future.
