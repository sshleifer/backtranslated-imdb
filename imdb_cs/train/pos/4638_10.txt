I saw this movie when I was in Israel this summer. my Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at any moment in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie has fired me away !!!!!! Describes two of the most significant taboos in the Middle East today: the homosexual relationship between Israeli and Palestinian. It allows a person to simultaneously enter both spheres of conflict. Dilemma, emotions. The film culminates in a tragedy when anger and fury drives one of the lovers to one side of extremism! Absolute must see!
