It's not "so bad that it's good," it's pure! For those who do not understand why you have a four-year intellect (in response to a comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of your own, a parody of you and a parody of me. It is the single most famous text in the history of the film. I got it and three overcups sitting on my DVD stand next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I'm writing scripts and this movie has once opened the genre of comedy for me, much like what we have never seen. It can be taken only partially ... its kind of exploitation ... now I'm just trying to reach the ten-line minimum. My note ended a moment ago. Let's hope it works when I submit it now.
