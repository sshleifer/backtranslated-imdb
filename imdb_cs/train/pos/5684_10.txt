Wonderland is a fascinating film starring film star John C. Holmes, who has been involved in the brutal murder of Wonderland. Propagation of the movie deceived a man by thinking that it was a romantic portraiture of pornoindustria in the veins of Boogie Nights, and that does not apply here. In fact, with the exception of several reporters' links that John Holmes is a porn star and a short set of real-life footage of John Holmes, this film is dramatically about the murdered personality of murder and how it happened. Despite being mistaken, the film is really fun. It's played out of all the cast and it's great and I'd like to say that Val Kilmer has an amazing ability to get down all the ways of John Holmes. I was absolutely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes probably looked and behaved as in real life. If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or as Hollywood stories, then I think you will love watching the wonders.
