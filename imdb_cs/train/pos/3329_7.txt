The only reason I saw this movie was Jimmy Fallon, who I was from the 9th grade I had first in the SNL. I'm a desperate fan of the Yankees and I have not found the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they start showing the ALCS game clips. I had to cover my ears and make small sounds, so I would not have to hear what can not be heard, but otherwise it was totally tolerable. I thought Jimmy played a very good role because the character was going to be nervous and unpredictable, and he's a nervous and unpredictable guy. I know this may not be the prize won by the Academy, but the film is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that's really good for both women and men. Jimmy and Drew work well and have much better chemistry than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that silly movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank you for the good because Taxi could kill him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone has to stop being so critical of his acting skills because he's just starting out in movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and when you look at one of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you will see that they have begun in some giants. Busom Buddies? Australian soap? Here we wish Jimmy's successful career on the screen. I never wanted to leave the SNL, but what can you do?
