Interesting characters, plenty of tension. Approaching black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by the accidentally supposedly sympathetic figure of the mainstream, a silent, almost deaf secretary, able to turn to crime to destroy his colleagues, share harsh people, and finally to participate in the robbery and establish someone as a grandson on his own. I am a little delayed from the tendency to other high-quality films to portray the criminals in a compassionate way without dealing with the injuries they have done to others than to portray their enemies immediately as plumbers. In this movie, we never know who the money is, it's actually running away, or what happens to an innocent wife whom a sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set the owner of a poor bar to fall for lack of prey. Damn, the movie could be great.
