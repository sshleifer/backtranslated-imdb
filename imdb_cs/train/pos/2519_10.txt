This movie is really strange. It's a very beautiful movie. Which begins with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, are poor children who live on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money and then their ability to live, buy a house and their life seems to be much better. They make a new friend, life friends. But something went wrong and they became enemies, and it all ended by killing each other. In the beginning, I was negative on this film because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very famous in Japan and Wang Lee - Hom - Taiwanese singer ) is trying to become actors, but it's not like other singers-movies. They do a great job and without any older movie experience (except Lee-Hom, who was previously in two movies). This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a very big fan of Hyde, but - it was the movie that made me discover him. Well, Gackt (playing the main character - orphan Sho) was a part of the group that wrote the script, and he was the one who insisted that Hyde should play Shoo's friend, Kei's vampire. At that time they do not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the end of the movie, they have become really good friends, and that also shows us that they really worked hard on this film and that they had good cooperation. The film has many different feelings that go through the story, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After people die, Kei leaves and everything changes so much. Still, it's a great movie, it's the only movie that ever screamed me, but it's so sad, but still wonderful. <br /> <br /> So if you did not see this movie, you should really. Because it's amazing but sad. You will not regret it. ^ ^
