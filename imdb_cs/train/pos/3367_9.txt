This movie has great acting, great photography and a very strong storyline that really thinks about who you are, how you define yourself, how you come, whether you accept playing a role or relaxing ... There are already excellent comments that deal with these aspects. I want to comment on the formal film setting. Basically, there are two people on the roof. There is unity of place and time, with 2 protagonists, and the radio acts as a choir. Many directors shot the Greek tragedy into the film, many directors shot contemporary stories as though they were Greek tragedies, but in my view, no director has ever been as admirable as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies in the story and the formal setting. Masterpiece.
