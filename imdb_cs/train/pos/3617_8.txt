"Girlfight" follows a project in which a high school girl in New York lives out of a feeling of futility in the world of amateur boxing, where she gains self-esteem, purpose, and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, the box is about the movie. So you can almost feel the sweat. Technically and artistically good shot with a sense of fairness and reality, "Girlfight" is no cat and not "Rocky". It is a very human course that can be met by viewers who do not know the box.
