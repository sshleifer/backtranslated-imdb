This film is very underestimated. He is very imaginative, creative and clever. It's just fun and in my opinion this movie starts first. The film, however, was forgotten when it first came out and became even more overlooked when the years passed. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office while the first was a very good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie was released a few years later. In 1991, Bill and Ted were already "as early as the 1980s". Even when it was only a few years ago, the landscape of music and style for children has so radically changed into gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle. Bill and Ted with their music Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses along with their 80s style looked out of place and very obsolete in 1991, and I think that's one big reason why the film was bombarding the box office. Nobody except surfers has always said things as "excellent!" and "fake!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 1990s, suffered a fate like a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too much associated with the 1980s. The transition from the 1980s to the 1990s was much faster than in the 1990s and 1990s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, while in 2002 and last year 2001 it still looks / looked like it was in 1995 or 1996. If only the "Excellent Adventure" produced in 1988 was released, THIS YEAR instead of 1989 and "Bogus Journey" was made quickly and released in 1989, then it would probably be just as wildly accepted as the first.
