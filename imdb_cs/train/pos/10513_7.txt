If you have any hints about Jane Austen's production, you will repeat the same thing in all of her novels: marriage, marriage, and marriage! In my opinion, all of the films in her novels are a bit boring, but I like the Austen characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat just like in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her lead role. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the film seems to be unable to think, but how to get a good partner and soon get married makes the film cheerful.
