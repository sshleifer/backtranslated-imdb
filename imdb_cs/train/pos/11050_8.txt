The spell works in a mysterious way. This film about the four prisoners who tried to escape with spells written by other prisoners hundreds of years ago was an excellent occult thriller with a surprising end and plenty of tension. Even if it had a play on the stage (almost everything was happening in the cell), it was never boring and it worked very well. In the "Cube" tradition, you feel trapped and even if you were a criminal, you have some sympathy with some of them just to change your mind with your plot. Some events caught you and there was always a touch of madness in the air. Overall, intensive and fun, and I did not expect anything (friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
