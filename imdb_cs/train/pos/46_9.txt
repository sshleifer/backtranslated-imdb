He just finished watching this film maybe seventh or eighth, picked it up once in the movie Blockbuster and absolutely liked it, I showed it to 4 people and they did it too. Avoid all Hollywood bits, special effects and emphasis on "shock factor," this independent movie, Paul F. Ryan, hits the nail when it comes to the consequences of traumatic situations. After two years of shooting, the two characters of Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) are an unlikely bond. Alicia, a stone-haired girl, Goth, who has a pessimistic attitude to life, helps Deana overcome the problems of life and death and live in the aftermath. Meanwhile, Deanna tries to help Alice to see again some of the softness and light in the world. Not to emphasize the shocking event of filming, but on the interpersonal relationships between those who survived, set this film. Despite its low-budget and short film time, this film is not far from cheese. Ryan respects a situation he has never mastered and attempts to plunge into human psychology. With an amazing future actress, Philipps adds the necessary drama to dialogue and overall feelings for the film, and Christensen helps make up for the "feeling of destruction and darkness" that this movie can have. Overall, I recommend this film, and if you like the issue of aggression and violence at schools and you will learn more about it, I also propose the documentary "The Road to Girls", published by CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social bullying by comparing and contrasting two a group of girls in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, a group of friends and acquaintances Dawn Marie Wellesley, who killed a 14-year-old girl after being brutally bullied.
