When I saw seven pounds, I was not sure what I was thinking, because the previews were left open enough to understand what the film was really about. So, in the first 20 minutes, you're completely lost in a plot, you have no idea what's going on, and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. It all ends when "such a bang", so to speak, is dissolved at the last moment of the film. Essentially, Tim (a blacksmith) was concerned and persecuted by the great accident he caused to cause the end of seven human lives. By doing so, he decides that the seven new people who need to help are wrong, what he gives his life to. The effect of this movie is great, because I think it will be a blacksmith no matter what part it seems to be. Rosario Dawson, it's one of her better movies for me, except for the eyeball I think it is. She was in some bad good, but she will add in this movie. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and are not big enough to grasp the character. Although the casting of the film was still good. This movie was definitely not what I expected and certainly the much slower pace I was hoping for. The film was still quite good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything falls into place. Until then, it seems like a nonsense love story. Ultimate thinking of seven pounds (seven stars).
