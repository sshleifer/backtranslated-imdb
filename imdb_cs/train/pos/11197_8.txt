Another quiet, triangular triangle film from Hitchcock, not secret, but very English, very well-traveled and photographed. Born Boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) becomes one of the "One Round" sparring partner Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) who partly maintains nice but innocuous Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis). Is there a lot of acting characters and grotesque? At the wedding of Jack and Mabel, the verger, standing in the aisle of the church, is shocked to see the very tall and very short men, the fat lady, the twins, of course, guessing which side of the aisle will sit and the wedding feast is fun. The rest of the film lost Jack Jack Mabel, and he was making his way back to her heart or something. It was a whole new era, with an audience in the evening dress and also with boxers who dressed in a circle. Camera angle, tempo, symbol usage, cutting - all very stylish and masterful. Working with the camera and editing the last boxing game are very fascinating. Brisson's good looks are well used in this; his smile is not so forgotten about what's going on around him, like Hitchcock's The Manxman, so he's not annoying. But boxers can have such crumbs?
