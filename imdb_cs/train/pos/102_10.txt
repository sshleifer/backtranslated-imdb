I first heard about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a child in elementary school (!). But it happened that one day I moved to encyclopedias in the classroom and under the entrance to the movie (or cinema, I do not remember ), there were several shots for different movies from the main stream to the experimental and one of them shown on the page was still for OffOn. I really enjoyed it because it was the most out of the page (it was still from the scene movie with the eye with the other elements that overlaid it). About 18 years later, the public library where I live here had a full set of 4 DVD DVDs "Treasures of the American Film Archive" released by the National Film Protection Foundation. So when I read the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the disks. After all these years, I finally saw the movie! After looking at it, it was not a bit it was, I expected it to be (it tended to be more organic looking a movie, not that it was a bad thing, but I expected it to have more electronic aesthetics), but was an impressive IMHO movie, considering the techniques used by Scott Bartlett to film, including manual tinting of the film itself, and the use of video equipment for some movie scenes (shot from a video monitor), which made it more difficult for me, the techniques used in this the film was pretty nice for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental movies and creative inspiration for me ...
