This is an interesting series that takes real-life people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with the ongoing serial character involved in this story. Rail detective "Matt Clark" - plays a role in watching the famous banned from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on true accounts. In this sense, it is an almost anthological series, and as somebody else has emphasized, this hostile structure represents some time-related context with real events, but it is a fun series with a number of events that satisfy the audience of 1950, still holding 55 years later. Clark cuts a strong figure on the western gear when it comes against some of the worst baddies of history. And his girlfriend Frankie is very nice. If you are a Western fan, do not forget to check out if you have a chance.
