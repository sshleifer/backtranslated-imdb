The Drama Club of my school will introduce this show in the spring of 2002 and I can only hope we are so good! I've been watching this movie recently as a kind of "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I'd like to say Vanessa Williams is the best! Wow! Casting for this movie was true (with one exception). Jason Alexander, my gawd, is something he can not do? It was the most amazing Albert Peterson at all - especially I loved all his funny facial expressions and danced during "Put on Happy Face!" It's so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said, is the best. Rosie was beautiful, and her transition from secretary to seducer was utterly believable. Tyne Daly was cheerful because Albert's unpleasant mother and George Wendt were great as poisoning by Mr. McAfee (though I loved Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau crackled me like Ursula Merkle; she has really improved it! And Marc Kudisch was an amazing Conrad Birdie ... "Patiently!" <br /> <br /> There was only one cast that I did not understand, and as you can see from previous comments, many other people do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I think she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she looks too old for her role. Eh, maybe I'm a vagrant. <br /> <br /> Well, I highly recommend this movie. You are smiling! <br /> <br />
