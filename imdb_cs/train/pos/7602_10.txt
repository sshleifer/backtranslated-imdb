The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​adapting to this island, while the mysteries were explored (and seen) was simply phenomenal; full of tension, lots of dudes, and an amazing conspiracy. I think I like the whole idea of ​​seeing them how to get used to the island. And then I first saw the smoke monster in the first episode really caught me. Since then, I have been addicted. The second season was first in the season, just a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of ​​hatches and the DHARMA initiative. The whole plot and season 2 sequences were mysterious, spooky and exciting. I loved all the tensions around the others on the island, but the story of DHARMA really made Season 2 amazing. Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I loved seeing the backstage of others, saw their camp, and looked at the secrets further explored. ("Tricia Tanak is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, without being so good, was still breathtaking and fun, but especially exciting! Now, the fourth season. I had hope for this season and the first couple of episodes are good, but then really got boring and monotonous. I mean, I really despise new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. Because of the old couple of episodes ... and most of all ... Season 4 was rid of something that made the LOST perfect series: secrets, tension, comedy mixed (Charlie off) and total excitement. Some of my favorite characters also left.
