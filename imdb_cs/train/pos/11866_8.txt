Most people who have seen this movie think it's the best movie ever shot. I do not agree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad ass and knows he's intimidating and using him to get ahead. It's about him and how he goes from dishwashing to having a big house and a cocaine office all over the table. If you want a family movie, then it's not a way to go, but if you want mobsters and revenge and the like, then you will like it.
