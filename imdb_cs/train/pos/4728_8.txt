After I saw "Break and Leg" in Vancouver at the celebration, I think it was a very nice movie. I had some wonderful laughs and some of the cameras (especially Eric Roberts) were screaming. So far, I have not heard of the actual release date, even though I've heard it's close. The story is simple, but it is mainly a vehicle for characters and situations. The script is smooth and hassle-free, the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is pleasant but fresh. This film has received at least one awards from EVERYDAY of the film festivals that took place, which is about 10 - 15 years. I highly recommend "Break a Leg".
