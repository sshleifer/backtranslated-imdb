This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave him 10 ratings. The story is known as the "Bushwhackers" of Missouri that fought on the south side of the war between states. The clothes they wore were authentic, history, and why they fought, are very accurate and well-researched. It was actually one of the battles that did not happen, as it did ... but it's not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well-occupied and were either the most brilliant actors, or the director really knows how to get the best of them. I suspect it was a combination of great overhead, supervising discovery of the right people and outstanding actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really wanted! It has action, romance, tension, good guys and bad guys (sometimes it depends on your individual perspective) and history has finally shot into one movie. He even has a future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's fine!
