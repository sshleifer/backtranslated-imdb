I had to be only 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was necessary for the whole family, I believe the Sun. nights. With repeated gags, Rob opened the cabinet (he had to use a scale or pointer to enter the correct location on other cabinets and did some other stuff, finally kicked the place where his door opened) and pulled the pins out of the new shirt (at the beginning of the episode opens the package with a new shirt, and for the rest of the show he finds one pin after the other that he missed when he unrolled his shirt, the timing was all, and the pins laughed a lot.) I remember the aunt who ran Rio as Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific . He wondered and came up with a "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis, which caused her to say how great he was. (you had to be there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why not make a series of their POV when Wally left (feared it was typical, but it was too late) I will never know. Somewhere I saw that the 1st television wedding (just as great) was on Carson's performance Tiny Tim. Horse. It was Rob and Nancy (sometimes I had it), and I remember learning the title of a TV guide and printing in all the papers and main magazines. A trip to the Broadcasting Museum in NYC years ago was disappointing that they had very few episodes and then they could be gone. I still remember him as wonderful and I wish I was a little older.
