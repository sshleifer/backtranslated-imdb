I recently searched for the newly released WIDE Screen DVD from FLY AWAY HOME and came up with an interesting title I never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough's film caught my attention (responsible for such subtle films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was William Nicholson (author SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of exciting sound materials and the price was just under $ 10 - so I chose it and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan plays as Archie Gray Owl, which has become a real life in the 1930s. She loved and respected the wild country of Canada and tried to protect her. Brosnan (who starred in James Bond's film) gives a shady, warm and powerful performance, like Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and influences his feelings for creatures from the ground - especially the beaver. The nice score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful portraits by Roger Pratt greatly contribute to the effectiveness of the film. And the bonuses on this DVD are something different! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with true gray oeuvre and sound commentary from Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine PLUS add-ons for those who have access to a DVD-ROM computer. GRAY OWL was released directly on a DVD in the United States - the fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not burdened with violence and sex. It's a movie that not only informs and entertains, but brings you something you should think about. I was very warm at the end of the movie - and a whole new love and understanding for the beaver! GRAY OWL is a very fine movie - it's worth it! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.
