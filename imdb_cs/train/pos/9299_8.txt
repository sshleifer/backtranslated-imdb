Loopy, but the smart and impressive mob boss Vic (Richard Dreyfuss's outstanding performance) is released from a psychiatric hospital. Several Crime Vic's colleagues, including the volatile henchman "Brass Balls" Ben London (the marvelous manic and feverish portrait of Gabriel Byrne), crazy Jake Parker (perfectly adulterated Kyle MacLachlan) and the ominous rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (Burt Reynolds' trying to get Vic. Meanwhile, Mickey Holliday (played with confidence Jeff Goldblum) found himself in the midst of all these deadly murmurs. Writer / Director Larry Bishop brings to this deliciously dark and fearless black comedy comedy about betrayal, fidelity and ruthless ambition of an exclusive hip, strange and original idiosyncratic feeling. The Bang-up cast has a rich grotesque rogues gallery of blithely amoral and a treacherous hoodlums: Ellen Barkin as a tough, mentally minor Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic is a reliable real-man Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as a philosophical Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's Sweet, Cute Lover Grace, Billy Drago as Slim Wells, and Christopher Jones as Brute Sculpted Artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace killer Nick. Catching up in cute bits are Billy Idol as blustery thug, Michael J. Pollard as the unfortunate Red, Joey Bishop as Misty Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a Cheerleader, and Richard Pryor as Jimmy Gravedigger. Byrne is a beautifully mentally ill duel with singer Paul Anko on "My Way", which features a clear culmination. The tense and entertaining climatic Mexican stand has similarly frustrated funny bones with something hysterical. Elegant cinematography by Frank Byers, the fearless walnut dialogue, the Earl Rose Rose Jazz Cocktail Lounge, and the choice of a vintage vintage swinging golden antique are all further expanding the impressively peculiar spell of this incredibly entertaining curiosity.
