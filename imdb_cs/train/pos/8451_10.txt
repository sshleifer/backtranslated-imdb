How did I get to this: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I've never seen anything like this and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on the VHS, and years later on the DVD part of Bandai's Anime Legends Collection. It was amazing and really worth watching. It had a lot of exploding actions that will blow you out of the seat. And, of course, "Just Communication" and "Rhythm Emotions" were the best. "Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. I like Wing Zero and Epyon and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the show: What this series also says that in real life war is very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose. But peace can also be hard to get, and I believe Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to achieve world peace, but this show is really the best of the best, so in the final review when you look at this show, look at the movie The endless waltz.
