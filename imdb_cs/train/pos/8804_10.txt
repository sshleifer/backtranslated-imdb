Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I've found it to be only Egyptian disappointment). Strangely, everyone except the Mexican director decided to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, Srebrenica widows, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and subsequent bloody spa, suicide bombings in Israel , paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the US, elderly people living alone, and the aftermath of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This could say something sad about the boundaries of empathy in both directions: directors might feel that Americans ignore the pain of the rest of the world and only look after their own tragedy while doing the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I found a piece of Sean Penno one of the best in the collection and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I also think his portrait Ernest Borgnine as crazy old man, New York apartment is experiencing his happiest widow's life is happiest the moment the sun shines through his window after the WTC "collapsed from the light path", I think it may also be one of the most insulting as a general American audience to see it.
