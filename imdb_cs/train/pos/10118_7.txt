I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, I saw this about 2 years ago and it really was my head. She had never seen such a sick and twisted thing before. The story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I have not seen a British or Japanese version, but I have to say that I believe the German DVD is a little censored. If you have not already seen a movie and live in Germany, maybe you should better look for a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. I-ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and unpleasant scenes, but during the showdown I felt something missing, about one or two very short scenes. Overall, a good perverse movie with crazy characters and high levels of violence, that's what Miike has for me!
