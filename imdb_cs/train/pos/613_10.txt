please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a courageous and original story created for a big screen. courageous, because the script has steadily made so many fantasy films that have been safely avoided - a step toward something new, creative and courageous. only if you think "I've seen it before" or "I'm sure it will happen right now." The Star would make an unexpected intervention and get you involved in the story more and more. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest part is done with such a talent that it fills me with respect for the creator of this film. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is a perfect witch and Claire Danes is a great choice for the innocent and loving star Yvaine. Other big names make an excellent role. I've been performing, everyone is trying to get the best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he "invented" for this universe - simply superb. I saw this film before the preliminary screening, the day before the official release, and I hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments and beautiful gentle scenes. Look in the eyes of Yvaine, the "frivolity" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia, the witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, it is the number one funny for the film of 2007, <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> peace and love
