She loved this show ... intelligent acting, intelligent dialogue, great story with real people .... please bring them back or make them online ... you really miss it .. I hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​six degrees ... In this crazy world it really makes sense. Get rid of those silly real estate shows and give this show a second chance Bring it back I do not want to move .. but please! When it was out of the air, I was looking online and liked how I could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the show when they miss the main time ... away are the days of endless recordings. Whenever you want to come back, I'm ready.
