In any case, my favorite novel, Austen and Paltrow, is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the film almost totally fascinating. Paltrow is doing a good job and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely amazing. The period detail is not alienating; the feeling of the movie is really right. But the real finding is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. It could not be a better cast, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but in the film I found him very humane and humane. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no obstacles to joy! Highly recommended. AnaR
