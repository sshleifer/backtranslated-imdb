I liked it! The task was strange that Drew Barrymore and DC who were dealing were both difficult for them. Drews acting was in place, but it could be until her life at that time. Dennis Christopher as a shrink was pretty cool and always doing the best - I'm a big fan of Dennis, so I bought a DVD. I did not finish! that the strange animatronic red skeleton thing looked the same as the movie, which is OK, I think, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife - if it was unpleasant, why just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confused when it was a strange thing the Doppelganger, or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger made it with Dennis and Patrick. In scenes with Patrick, if Dennis was like Doppelganger, then I think Patrick would have noticed it. The music was fine, but it was difficult on the spot, the whole orchestral score seemed to revolve around the subject, but the subject was exaggerated. Big mix of lots of blood and freeus shots of Drew naked. <br /> <br /> Overall, a bit of GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much about it, do not look for secret news and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are some diamond moments and goofs enore-watch it, and it's fun with him!
