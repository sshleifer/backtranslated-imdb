Now my friends, movies like "La Bete" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done on the old continent :), in this movie we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac dear gorilla, meaningful dialogues, etc. In grave terms, it is aleatory that some may sometimes be animal, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's a stunning movie experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking use I recommend this movie. If you like, I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
