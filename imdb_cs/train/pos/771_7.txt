I watched the film together with a homophobic friend, wife and friend. So I had opinions from all directions. The film mainly laughed me, the sexual tension was not really there and the only notable actors were Tudor Chiril and Maria Popistas. Yes, I think she played well, although the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors, they just did not have complicated roles. I applaud that Puya enters the movie. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he's a good actor. But my wife loved the movie and I think it could be the chords I played and I had no ear with. If the film tried to introduce unusual sexual behavior and its consequences in today's Romania, then it did not work well. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes a boring, uninteresting plot. I have no idea why they won all the BAFTA prizes. In her book, she should receive the "Another Opportunity for Better Happiness" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
