Jet Li brings his charismatic presence again on the film screen in the movie Black Mask. In this movie, Li plays Tsui, a getaway from a super soldier program who is trying to get the humanity he has taken away from the program. To do so, Tsui decides to become a librarian to live in a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires him to clear up the problems of the past before he can continue to seek peace. The other members of the super military program escaped at the same time as Tsui, but they also want to get to the world rather than find inner peace. Tsui will become the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from releasing information that could make many innocent people their lives. This movie screams on the screen at a furious pace and never leaves its audience. Martial arts are amazing, but because it uses wires, it does not have to be valued as much as the American audience deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good acting because they deal with psychological and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I'm glad that some of the Jet Li films will finally get to the US and I'm looking forward to having an impact on how they will require the changes that this release will require (things like dabing and soundtrack). This is one of the best movies of Li, coming out and seeing May 14, when he is released in America.
