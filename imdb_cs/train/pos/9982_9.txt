I saw this movie last night after I waited for ages and ages to be released here in Canada (still limited). It was waiting to wait and then some. I am very excited by the reader Margaret Laurence and was delighted that this novel turned into a movie. Actually, I ended up liking the film better than the novel. I liked Bram Shipley's character a little harder, and it seemed that Hagar and Bram seemed to be a love story that made scenes at the end of Bram's life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was no longer enjoyable on the film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was brilliant in this role. She was Hagar through and inside. Christine Horne was great, and she has many other great things ahead of her. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, a total of 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD, it must own for my collection!
