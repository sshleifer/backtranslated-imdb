Generally I love these 1930s secrets / police Charlie Chan, and that's no exception. But in this movie, something seems to be bad. Late attempt to move from a brain-engine motorcycle that centered around the drawing to a salad bar humiliated with comic relief that is as relaxing as sore feet. Typically, a canyon appears from everywhere that looks like a clumsy Englishman who plays a detective, and even other characters seem to be involved in a comedy. The story may seem to us today with a special or excused excuse, but at that time, the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real but, of course, the possibility.
