Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. Usually I do not go to military / war movies, but it took time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also funny. Beringer's figure turned out to be heroic and honorable. No matter what, you know he has a back. <br /> <br /> Zane the character evolved throughout the movie. It was not just a suit, he definitely proved he could be a hero and handle a gun. Finally, it ended me a bit. It really did not work in the movie, but I'm glad to see it. However, it is worth seeing.
