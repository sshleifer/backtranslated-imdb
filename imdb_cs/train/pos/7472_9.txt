I really enjoyed this movie. I read a few more comments and although I like those who did not understand, I agree with some critics. Which makes me strange that I like the movie. I agree that they have a pretty good cast to showcase the intelligent film to the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch. I also love movies like the one that raises so many debates, theories, possible endings, and a hidden subtext. Congratulations to Mr.Crowe, definitely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the first exit when I was in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I had a great trip of paranoia! Where does the dream come true and the real one?
