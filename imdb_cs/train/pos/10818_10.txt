Why is it so low? I really can not ... Is it because of bad acting? Bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in noisy low-budget horror movies? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in these films. People who hate movies just because of bad behavior and bad dialogue should not be able to rate cheese-based low-budget films. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected it to be a gorefest, but it's not gorefest and the gore is pretty bad (mostly it's just a living intestine located on the actors' body and it's chrome) but I did not care because the movie is cheerful! Characters are cheerful, acting is merry (bad acting is a good thing in noisy low-budget horror movies), dialogue is cheerful (bad dialogue is a good thing in noisy low-budget horror movies), zombie rapist with a huge dick is a cheerful flying kid's demon cheerful and I can go on and on and on but I do not mean too much ... But I have to mention that is the scene in which the girl masturbates sex doll like it alive lol! Oh and a zombie rapist falls into love with a lol sex doll! <br /> <br /> The best lines in the movie: detective morals: * sniffs coke * detective Sloane: What * beep * Do you, Manners? What the hell did you sneak? What the hell? Detective ways: It's not human, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... Detective morals: * Inject heroin into your hand * Detective Sloane: What do you say * Beep * Mravy? Are you * beeping * crazy? Detective ways: It's cold medicine. Detective ways: * Repeatedly kicks a random person into the face. * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, behavior? What are you doing? Detective ways: This maniac with the demons trembled and then began to break his head on the rock! He's just begun to break his head on a rock! I think it's on PCP or something like that! <br /> <br /> LOL!
