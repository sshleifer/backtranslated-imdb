The film is just fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" at the time the film was shot. I watched the movie over and over again, alone and with friends, and is still fresh and fun. With the threat of being too serious, the notion of being a big fan of a particular group is timeless and middle school students bored with drudgers of some classes is just like overtime. And the movie has some gem lines / scenes ..... links to how our life in our high school follows us. (Make sure I was in high school on, uhhh, for several years and it does not follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I get some static" ..... "There is not as much as you get, "says principal leader Togar) ..... a member of a school that is so dilapidated that nurses visit him .... Nazi Hall of Fame Monitors love" body search "...... Principal Togar announces:" I give you the ultimate solution "and burning Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD) .... and of course Joey Ramone commented," Things have changed since we kicked out a high school, "followed by Togar, who asked, "Do parents know that you are Ramones?" One advice ... the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone sadly died young. Dey Young, who was in the movie the main hero, reminds us today that all ages ... PJ Soles career never progressed as we could expect ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, apparently (one of my male friends dying over her every time we look at the film), although her performance is more than adequate and should bring her more youthful film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steyle? <br /> <br /> So, watch and enjoy ..... unthinkable ... you just have fun!
