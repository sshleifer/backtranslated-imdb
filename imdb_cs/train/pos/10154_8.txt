This is Michael Vartan's first movie I saw - I did not see Alias ​​- and I was curious if that guy could act. Surely he can and is nice in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course wonderful, but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and sweet in this different "sweet" role of the teacher. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the film is full of clichés, and the story does not feel true at all. Also, although every character in the movie knows how well they look together, I do not think there is a screen chemistry out there. However, I enjoyed this film. The locals are nice, the characters are nice and good and the actors are pretty good. If you expect to see great romance, it is not. But if you want to see a nice innocent charity movie with sympathetic characters, it's very good.
