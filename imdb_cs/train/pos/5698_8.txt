Val Kilmer ... Love or reluctance sometimes gets under the skin of a character and pulls off a performance that brings you to "Hey! This guy is a great actor!"

What Kilmer does so effortlessly, radiates the low life of a celebrity, doing anything to someone who wants to overwhelm anyone who has it and then lost it. Go to him, you'll know what I mean.
