I enjoyed almost all of the films in the Dirty Harry series, except for what I think is called Enforcer. "Deadpool" was also a bit weak in the areas, but I still enjoyed it. This is one of my favorite series, if nothing else for the great line "Go on, do your day". This one also has an interesting, though famous, plot of someone who kills those who have done it wrong. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the murders and you have your plot. Sure it is a bit more than that because it has a very nice final showdown in the amusement park. It also features Dirty Harry getting a bulldog as a gift and jumping Sandra Locke in a somewhat humorous scene. The only question that remains is that Clint Eastwood has had a rather average actress Sandra Locke in so many of his films. She brings score by point every time, although the overall movie is nice to me. She promised she was not bad here, but her character might be a little better. Another issue with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, sometimes seems to be almost weapon ads. I like guns as well as another person, but do we really need scenes that explain all the different forces of their latest weapon and how many bullets do they hold? Nevertheless, a very nice entry into the series of Dirty Harry movies.
