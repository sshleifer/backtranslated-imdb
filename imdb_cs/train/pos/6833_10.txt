Beautiful movie, pure Cassavetes style. Gen. Rowland gives the amazing performance of a falling actress who is engaged in success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. He tries to escape his subconscious spirits, embodied by the deadly ghost of a young girl. Adopting oneself, the human condition, though with its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theater sequences and the film itself is mysterious: it is as if the herd became the starting point for Heroin. If all the American films could only be of good quality, dealing with adult human relationships, without trying to infantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas when. 10/10.
