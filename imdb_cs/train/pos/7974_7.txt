I found this film as the usual French slap in the American face. The camera is too often focused on fat people, careless homes, and sticky rural areas. While the story seems to sympathize with small urban people who are seen and admired by viewers, cinematography is abusive and demeaning. Undoubtedly, thin people and neat, organized homes were seen in Glencoe, but Malle decided to show us the worst of what was visible there. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American creators will go to France to reveal their worst elements to the American public. I can assure you that as a frequent visitor to France, that is not good there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated and create serious social inequalities. But Americans have no desire to uncover French because of their prejudices against their compatriots and their envy with the US, so we probably do not see movies on the subject.
