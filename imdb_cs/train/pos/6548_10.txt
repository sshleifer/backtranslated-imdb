This is a great movie! I played all the games of Nancy Drew and I read books and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you have never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so you might get used to Nancy, then you can watch the movie because they really do not give the characters "names quickly"; and the plot was immensely interesting - it's the final return from previous Nancy Drew movies that actor Nancy Drew did not seem to be responsible for - this movie is much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker - it's so cool! track!
