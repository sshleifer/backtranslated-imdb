If you do not like Roman Polanski's "Forgiveness," you should probably look at the "tenant" because it's a similar concept when Polanski enters and plays a schizophrenic wave. This is actually one of my favorite films - secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course - and is a direct way to the mental collapse of a man who moves to a former suicide victim's apartment. The other residents of the building are all kind and keep the noise level down - even the smallest "titter" is becoming a big problem, and Polanski, who stars, is becoming more paranoid and subject to hallucinations as the films are being transferred to. She gets to the point where she dresses and acts as a former tenant, and realizes it's just a matter of time before she decides to show again how her lethal jump from the window has gone ... The film is relatively slow and but if you've ever seen Roman Polanski, you should know that it will end with a bang and this movement will not fail. It's also best if you do not question the complexity of the assumptions and just consider it a descent into madness, because it's sometimes a bit trippy unreal at times. Polanski is very good, like a haunted, unpleasant resident, who is always attracted by the well-known Isabelle Adjani. We also saw him running in the move, which is disturbing and cheerful at the same time! Damn it, she does one ugly cat! So fans of Polanski - who really can see their 30-year pedophile charges - should enjoy the "tenant" as a fun psychological expedition ...
