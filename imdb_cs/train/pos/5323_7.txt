There are a number of things that are not right, though it is not very important because what happened to whom and when it is still going on. The most common freedom with the facts I think is when they start playing on Kaiserkeller's Bruno Koschmidder when they actually played Indian and moved to Kaiserkeller later. With Semprinni20 I agree that the movie was taken in favor of the Pete Best version, but if it's a story consultant, then I think he calls shots. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best recordings play the last word about why he was released. Though the film is not as abundant as the later "Backbeat" movie, I prefer this film because it is more accurate and has a better script with deeper characterization. There's a lot of stuff in the movie - for example, Brian Epstein is trying to hide the fact that he was queer-bashed just to find out that the group knew he was Gay all the time. Little touches like a band arrives at the caf√© and orders "Corn-Flakes with Milch". My favorite scene, which basically has some bass, is auditioning when Stuart Sutcliffe just bought a bass guitar, but he can not play it so he's impressed with his back and tries to pretend but he's caught. That's rock'n'roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
