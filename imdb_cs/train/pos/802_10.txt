I know it's a good end, but honestly it was amazing. I love when the film ends in the amazing dark nature, but this time I was overwhelmed by Darth Vader, who turned against the emperor, who I really amazed. The anxiety sequence in this movie was when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. It is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of Sith, rules out his dark master. Nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of the Rebel Battle and all the Imperial warships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought to the screen Mon Calomari, Ewoks, Sullestean (Lando's pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in the movie: 1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is mortally wounded. 2 - When Luke sees the spirit of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then appears Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in star wars) 3- When LEia kills Jabba strangling Hutt a criminal. <br /> <br /> I personally like the scenario and battle of Endor, representing the ground and space struggle and the best duel of star wars between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the bikini are unforgettable. 9/10.
