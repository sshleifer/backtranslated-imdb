Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland can be for someone other than Lynch and that's what makes it a funny and collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Eeriness? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no brains and hurt their wife and children for fun. From Mexico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth bleed, all the noise and violence makes us scream and give me a bed. 2- Get the stick! Yeah baby get it and learn a lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3. Ants. The more Lynch episodes of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
