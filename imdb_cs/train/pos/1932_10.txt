I think I usually approach film festival comedies with a low expectation that they will always be "odd" and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the simplicity of the characters in the face of a complex context. Very bad swimming was exceptional that the director managed to keep the film's integrity and character development while still laughing in the scene after the scene. It was sophisticated, perhaps even due to some of the hard work of DP, I rarely saw in Indian film and rarely in comedy. A special note here: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy teacher of mathematics. When I saw this performance, I can not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a wider audience. It brings the necessary combination of anger and exuberance to the role that really helps this image to reach its potential. It is an amazing work that deserves a larger audience. I look forward to more from the director and this cast!
