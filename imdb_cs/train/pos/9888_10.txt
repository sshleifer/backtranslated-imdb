Although this beautiful piece of art uses some of the film's surrealism dictionary, it really is not such a thing. It is the political and cultural allegory of the Mexican post-Columbian odyssey, as confirmed by even the progress that looks at the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> Unlike "like water for chocolate," "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet him at least in half, so understanding takes a bit of work. (A good starting point is to see a grandmother like Spain: proud, light, sad and predominantly weighted with history.) The final acts of heroines are obscure because the "result" of history (ie the presence) is always obscure because we are too close to honoring it . The refusal to fit free ends is the only real choice for the director, given the ambitions of the film. "Erendira" is beautiful. A great experience would be ideal if you can capture it at a local art house or university screen. But if not, VHS is better than never to ever see.
