Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan husband and I have seen this emotional lesson in history. Spain is again moving towards a political confrontation. This is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish universities. It is a great lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. An American pilot joining the Spanish Civil War chose a democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well illustrated in one of the most inventive scenes Uribe ever did. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) Used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Weapons that have begun abuse of power even against innocent children are now active again. A film like "El Viaje de Carol" / "Carol's Way" tells one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. It's a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again great work from the Iberica Peninsula!
