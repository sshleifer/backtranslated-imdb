Greetings again from the darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides insight into some of the cruelty of animals living in the wild. For anyone over the age of 40, the wild kingdom Omaha has provided a great deal of our insight into wildlife from our childhood ... back where there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching the elephants who are suffering from the days is almost as unpleasant as the lack of water is so painful. But their night battle against the lions is exciting. Some underwater shots are breathtaking. Mom and Baby Hunchbacks are beautiful and look at how big a white shark attacks her prey is as cool as "jaws". The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I have never seen such details of a large scale. Do not think most young children will be thrilled today, but it is definitely one of the most beautiful photographic documents I've ever seen.
