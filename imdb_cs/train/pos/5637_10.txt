I would like to say that I have seen this movie twice and I love it! Acting is great, and although it's a similar plot called "Boost your voice," I think the story is never bored for people who like things like that. It has some great lesson in it and shows us that if we try, we can do anything. An incredible movie. I'm sure this is the one I'll watch for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes a book, it's a pretty realistic plot, perhaps not a part of love, but part of being different and fighting but best to come out is really real. The only little criticism is why is the main girl in these movies always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would meet the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average? I doubt ..
