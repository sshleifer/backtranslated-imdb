The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villarong is studying how children who experience violence and isolation in their remote community are developing into troubled young adults who need some psychic tools to cope with their hidden mental fragility. Whether these instruments are followed at a fanatical level by religion, the care of the other, or the simple deployment of macho images as a male prostitute, Villarong produces a successful exploration of how these vices affect three young people living in Spain under Franco. Three are witnesses of disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and then bury emotions that feel with their peers fragile corpses until they meet again in the hospital for those who suffer from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The film style of the text is typically visually opulent, as you would expect from the Spanish author, and very much reminds of the work of Spanish associate Pedro Almod√≥var with sexual desire issues, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between these two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural undertone associated with claustrophobic, flamboyant realism against Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. a young psyche and includes disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that remain after publishing for a considerable time.
