The film was a long-awaited release, which was a little disappointing for the expectations I made. When I look at it again, I must say it's okay. First of all, it is an original history (of course not entirely) and as such it is only a preservation of the right to film. The modesty of history as a child is shown and is very true as the original. Acting may not be the best in the neighborhood, and the plot is a bit thin, but when compared to the 1966 movie, it's better, just because they are not trying to be musical. In general, I would recommend it to fans of Modesta Blaise or someone who caught them on TV.
