What class of British cinema! It's time. And a side-breaking comedy to start! Whoever seeks to revive a little bit of freedom from their poorly satisfied youth, this road movie is a ticket. It's a mix between "Thenail and Me" and "Easy Rider". The film runs at a steady pace and does not let you take too long ... Reflective moments sometimes appear, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are showing. I was a little anxious at first by the character of Phil Daniels, but fortunately I got over half in one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie! Generally, I found myself in the belly of the laugh of a movie that most likely poison some people around me. Good. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend. It will become an iconic British comedy. It is worth a visit.
