Domestic import was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was funny on so many levels, from crazy clothes to funny situations. The game was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else do a great job. Since it is a separate film written by the first author, it does not have the cliches expected from other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and hearts of the warming story. Did I hear that's true? If so, then it is cheerful (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
