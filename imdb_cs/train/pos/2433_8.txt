I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Casper the Friendly Ghost". It looked like it was early because Casper did not look right * just like Porky Pig does not look right * in old cartoons in 1930. But I'm going to turn ... Anyway, this episode in the afterlife of the ghost is thinking about his friendship with the young todd, which is named Ferdie. I remember seeing Casper as a friend, because those who looked at the cartoons are used to knowing that most people are running away from him and shouting "The Spirit!" Casper and Ferdie have a bit of fun together until someone else ... I hate to leave you with a hemisphere, but the cartoon is only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone who reads an IMDb cartoon synopsis can deduce what will happen ... The finale is a little heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I ever felt when I was watching the cartoon. But that only means it has moved me, which probably explains why I decided to comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or hell, the fact that I DO NOT USE YOU from you is because of his emotional effect on me - I have not seen it since. But the cartoon ends on a remarkable insight and I was pleased to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. I got this 8 out of 10 stars cartoon. The second only to Cartoon Warner Bros. "Peace on Earth," is the most I've ever been released by animated short.
