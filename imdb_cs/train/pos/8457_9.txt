Gundam Wing to me will become a good anime. Slightly moving (especially around the center of the series), but above all pleasant. Now that anyone jumps to my case and calls me a "wing", I admit that I was watching all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08 Team MS and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were a few problems with telling stories and a couple of characters might seem to be rip-off (ie Zechs Marquise on the original Gundam char), but this is an alternative space show based on the original series , such as SEED. <br /> <br /> To see this series, make sure you first follow the original Gundam and then you know you are watching the AU series.
