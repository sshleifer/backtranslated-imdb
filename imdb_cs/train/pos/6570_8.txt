This movie is a harmless rescue. Something of a recent Tomb Raider movie was missing. I can not wait to get a DVD. How can people give this low score and they are still going to see Titanic without a guilty conscience I do not know. Whatever Karen Kopins in the underwear needs to evaluate another point or two!
