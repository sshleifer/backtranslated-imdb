While Hollywood became stagnant in a few years after the Second World War, England developed a very prolific film industry. In "Men in a White Suit", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that is never dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses are likely to be out of business! How can Sidney handle and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the best films in which Alec Guinness played before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. It's a good look at the total absurdity of the business world. If you plan to start a business, you might want to watch this movie.
