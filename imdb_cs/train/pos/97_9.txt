it was a favorite Christmas special I would like to go to vhs or dvd because my 33 RPMs are lost and all the tapes I've made are long gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John Denver fan, but he was very impressed by the music that was mostly traditional favorite with Muppet spin (esp Little St. Nick!) It also contained a few well-known songs (the original?). Although it was done at the end of the 1970s when this show had a timeless feel. I hope we'll find a copy soon!
