The reviewer, who called this busty film, apparently lacked this point. Obviously, he had not been young or innocent for a long time, or he understood that the tragedy was that meaningful young characters actually thought they could change by folding posters and holding raves of peace. If it was just that easy. But cynically they sit and grin at people who have tried to make the best of things, as the situation worsens and gets worse every day. Well, if you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. The central theme is that revenge causes more revenge, which is even more proliferating in ever-expanding bloodshed. Both sides will tell you stories of atrocities committed by the other party that they think justify their committing even more in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he missed the meaning of the "bubbles" mentioned by the name, and that the people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly facts of what is happening around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (Ashraf also seemed to slip through the checkpoints without any difficulty, which tells me that he did not pay attention when Ashraf was related to the delays and problems he had encountered.) I found it a very courageous director, script writer and stellar enthusiasts, update the story of Romeo & Juliet in a modern turbulent country and make both men's lovers. Let's be honest: Very few people would have a problem if one of them was a woman (young love wins all the hearts) - but when human turmoil adds with their sexuality to the fact that these people will rather let them hate each other, then the conclusion is inevitable .
