Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to introduce Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). Years of killing took Springwood tolls. He came to the conclusion that a small town had become a virtual city of spirits. Parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago paid the final price. Only the crazy inhabitants of the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But Freddy will not stop in search of the last vengeance. No matter how he tries to stop him, he always returns for another. But this time he learns a bit more about his old life. Can children stop Freddy in the end? What is this mystery buried in Freddy's twisted mind? you will find that you have to watch Freddy's dead man. the end was originally shot in 3-D. <br /> <br /> A good way to stop the franchise. Freddy learns about himself and his perverse life, and he sets out for a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger are playing this last installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make a special show. It's much better than last, but it's full of jokes. If you like this series, then you do not want to miss this. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to fans of Freddy.
