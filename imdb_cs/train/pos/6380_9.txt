Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. It is true that this film started slowly, but as the film was wearing, I became more. The story takes place in 1914 and is around the guy Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he embarked on his amazing adventure. On the way he must feel friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice is great. They certainly know how to wear movies with a voice talent. Music is nothing special, but equally sympathetic. Animation is not the best, but it's still good enough. Overall, it's a good family film for all ages. Rate this movie 9/10.
