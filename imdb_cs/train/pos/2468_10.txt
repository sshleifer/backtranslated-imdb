I went to visit Hamlet because I was in employment. I thought four hours would be great, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead again, Henry V. I was totally amazed by the cinematography film he had captured. Just like other reviews, 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh is not playing Hamlet, it's Hamlet, he was born for it. When I look at this movie, I'm constantly trying to find mistakes, looking at the hooves and not noticing them. How he managed to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was shot at 70 million. It is a shame that Colombia did not publish a widescreen version of this version on VHS. I own a DVD player and I would take it every day through Titanic. So if you hear Columbia, shoot the movie the way it should be watched! And I do not know what happened to the Oscars. It was the best, best actor, best director, best cinematography. What movies were watching? I apologized to Branagh at Oscarach when he took Shakespeare's screen. We should take the tribute to Branagu that he brought us one of the greatest movies of all time.
