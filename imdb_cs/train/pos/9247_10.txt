I expected this film to be a novel from the 1930s. The boy meets the girl, she falls in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy finally wins her. It was not at all. Clark Gable plays with artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and dirty eyebrow picking. He hides himself from the cops as he enters Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow) to find her in a bubble bath. Instant chemistry.It plays hard to get a moment, but a girl can only resist that smile so long. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that are definitely a pre-production code! When blackmail is done badly, and Ruby ends up in the board for "troubled girls," she's unhappy, and thanks to her roommates she starts to believe Eddie will never come to her. Harlow plays the perfect and fast-talking Ruby. He never lets Gable get all good lines! There is a particularly moving scene with her playing "their song" on a piano that behaves perfectly. I have to cry for the last fifteen minutes every time. Great sweet romance.
