I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Just say, whenever I'm depressed about how foolish or futile things seem to be, it's the movie I'm going to rent to put me in the right frame of mind. Background music makes you aware of how simple the existence is and how simple it provides the greatest happiness. An Indian girl who sings is just one example of a character in this movie that does not work hard and is happy as a result. Persifina, Ruby's collaborator (Ashley Judd), is another - - the eyes and the smile could make the day of the most difficult person. I'm watching this movie and dreaming of better days coming or good conversation with friends, and I realize that Ruby himself is often not like lonely. Recommended for anyone who enjoys the thoughtful calm of the film.
