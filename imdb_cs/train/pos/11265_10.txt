I never knew who Robert Wuhl had seen before. But when I saw it, I realized he was a funny man. This special HBO music is equipped with a "American history" lesson for students of New York University film and the man was simply phenomenal. He tried to enjoy almost all the key historical events that took place not only in the US but also in other parts of the world. This documentary comedy was a great satire that made me wonder if what I accept as an infallible true history is really true. I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and learned a lot more exciting. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about history and is willing to ask what his beliefs are.
