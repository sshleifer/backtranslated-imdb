Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without a British accent, he is more than spending on it with his over-top and larger-than-life interpretation by Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Especially effective when confronting Bob Cratchita in his office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight over him throws a shining cloak over him; all you see is his silhouette. Enhanced by Scott's voice, somewhat grumpy, the effect is galvanized ... just like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror," really! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, what works for you can also work against you. Because Scott shows such joyful wildness in the movie, it's infectious. In other words, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "after", though it really should not be. That's what you might call "Doctor Smith," because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to playing this role and many other heavy ones (scenes and so on). In fact, consider Scott's anger as a commitment. But other bourgeois "Christmas Carolina" could. Watch the movie and judge yourself.
