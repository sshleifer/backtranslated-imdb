This film came out in 1975 and was the second of three parts of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. Last, when we saw Sheriff Pusser, he laid the hospital bed behind him and his wife, who was killed on Sunday morning. After Pusser recovers, he goes after the men who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he is after, or the crowd trying to try to take him out, than he accomplishes. The only thing that bothers me about this picture is a real story. How could you go to a city with this kind of crime, and do nothing about it. Since there was no real actress in this photo, I can not give her 10 stars, but I can give 8
