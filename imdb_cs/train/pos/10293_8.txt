`Bruce the Almighty 'wins the Oscar for the record 14 Oscar victories! It goes beyond Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's renown will be so high that he will announce his candidacy for the presidential party at the White House play-off in 2004. The Almighty then! These noble fantasies would only appear if the filmmakers (including Carrey) had the power of God. The same assumption is the main ingredient of Carrey's new laugh, Bruce the Almighty. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor for holding God to the absolute blame for his own bouts. God, the heavenly, who plays Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the "gift of God" (his powers) to attack him if he can do God's work better. It is obvious that Bruce gets new blessed skills and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual all-powerful comedic form in Bruce Almighty. Jennifer Aniston was not "bad" like Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to the director Tom Shadyac to leave the dog out of the house for # 2, and shows us the most cheerful doggoned bathroom scene ever! "Bruce the Almighty" is not the deepest film of Carrey, but it is still a omnipotent giggling show "Carreyism"! **** Good
