It was at 7:30 am, too close to school. Animation and computer graphics were spectacular at the time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people who accidentally throw spacecraft and robots was awesome. Maybe it inspired the Treasure Planet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in DVD format. The examples are essentially the same. When viewing non-sequential episodes on DVD, you are stoned by disk # 3. Under today's standards, animation is dirty. We do not already see computer graphics and focus on how characters are made instead. <br /> <br /> Bright spots are characters of the heroine. They were much more credible, taken more seriously than modern heroes and were not destroyed. In fact, they saved the men.
