Why am I convinced that there is some other film version of this novel somewhere? I've seen the movie again this year when I'm learning a novel and finding changes in the movie unpleasant - the little boy is not showing up in the novel and the end has changed. They kill him in the movie, but the whole thing is that it's a terrible event in the Eel Marsh House for many years, but he's getting married and eventually giving the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is much more sympathetic in the novel, the scene in a movie where Kipps lights an office, is simply a crazy and constant look of a toy soldier to signal the presence of a child is really scary but unnecessary - Kipps is persecuted by a woman who seeks vengeance, not a child. I'm sure I saw a movie that is a better and closer and more scary novel. Have I imagined it?
