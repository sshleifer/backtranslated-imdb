I watched as many TV series as I watched but unfortunately I started to work in which I worked in the evening. I managed to capture at least some recordings ... and of course bought the recently released DVD of the entire series. If you are watching a DVD, you can see that the animation was initially a little rough, but after finishing the pilot, they cleaned up a lot of defects. Voices are good for the characters and writing is excellent. It's rather refreshing when you see animation getting back to its roots by re-inserting adult themes. The point is, as society came in the last century, it must be all the more spectacular to today's standards to be recognized as an adult show. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that are parallel to what we often face in real life. It's your typical sitcom in this respect, but humor is more like what you would expect from late night TV such as talk show skit or Saturday Night Live ... back when the SNL was really funny. Good work, Dreamworks. You may have to work with one of the more liberal networks to go through this series ... and also to improve the marketing of the series to help with the high costs. It's a challenge to do it for a cartoon of mature nature. Hmm ...
