Yeah, it's a low budget. Yeah, it's one of Candy's first movies, but maybe it's his most fun! John Candy was not that far from his days SCTV in "Going Berserk" and shows it. If you do not try Candy trying to help a man with his food while hand-cuffed to a stray cohort in the process of sex with his girlfriend with only the door of the apartment to separate them (huh? Look at the movie!) Or the way Euguene Levy (creator of Kong Fu Yu) speaks to his mother on the phone, or just a myriad of facial expressions that only Candy can better control your pulse! If you like John Candy from "Only the Lonely," it's not a movie I'd advise you to see, but if you like SCTV's days John Candy, this movie must be seen!
