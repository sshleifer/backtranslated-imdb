This is probably one of the worst movies ever shot. It's scary. But it's so good! It is probably best if you did not see that they would expect it to become a complicated conspiracy and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch this to see 50 million vases and Goro is fantastic hair / bad English, you are in real treats. The harder you think of a movie, the worse it will be if you do not have a competition to notice most of the holes / dizziness, in which case you have hours of entertainment ahead of you. I would really recommend this movie to fans of bored or hard Smap. And even he should be a little cautious because Japanese Goro fans were a little upset, they thought he was selling himself. (It was not really when Johnny Kitagawa (who was an executive producer) can do it for him).
