I have loved this film since I was 7 years old and I saw it on the opening day. It was so moving and beautiful. I strongly recommend to see for everyone. It's a movie that you can watch with the family from afar. <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, extended disaster scenes, nudity / sexuality and some language.
