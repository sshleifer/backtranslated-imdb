This film, though one of the most popular themes of Mexican producers: Extreme life in our cities has a fun way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors of recent times are approaching the history of our city, in various literary species, as it may be a farce or satire, which gives us a film with an overly exposed theme in our country but told in a very different way, giving him fresh freshness. <br /> <br /> With actors little known but it interprets the excellent way of their paper, each one of the directors reflects in stories the ability we have been identified anywhere in the world that the ability to laugh with pain and celebration of sorrow. Perhaps for many people in our country the film is not pleased, but I think people from other countries might find it attractive and share Mexican surrealism.
