Talented Detective Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels an overseas trip to investigate a seemingly abridged and dried suicide case, has reason to suspect that there is really much more, rather a deliciously complicated murder! <br /> <br /> As far as murderous mysterious movies are concerned, it just is not better than this one. Popular with suspicious figures, all connected with dog show and all with great reason to kill the obvious suicide victim Archer Coe, it's really hard to figure this out or wrap around the head, but kid, it's fascinating to watch the advance before us. Even cops, coroners, and district lawyers turn out to be colorful, expanding characters, contributing to unexpected fragile realism and increasing their overall "funny" factor. I especially enjoyed comic scenes that included a coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), which always seems to be roughly and prematurely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this run. Also detective Eugene Palette Sgt. Heath provides a welcome, often lately humorous at her own expense, a critical commentary during Vance's investigation. I can not think of any valid criticism to actually interpret this film, except that it was not particularly good. It does not stop the movie from being simply a good fun browsing though. Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this secret. Highly recommended to try!
